## Course CS5234 Code
This is a repository for my code in NUS School of Computing course CS5234: [Combinatorial and Graph Algorithms (Fall 2016)](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/CS5234/)

* Sketch/

A navie implementation of L0-sampler by python. It tests the wrong algorithm descriped in Problem 1. of [Problem Set 3](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/CS5234/2016/psets/pset3.pdf) 

The result of the sketch.py shows that only a few of the initial graph nodes can be reconstructed, and the sketch will become empty far before it output all the nodes.

* pset4/

An experimenting assignment, in which two sketch algorithms are compared on the accuracy.
For more detailed information, see [Problem Set 4](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gilbert/CS5234/2016/psets/pset4.pdf)
