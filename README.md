* Sketch/
A navie implementation of L0-sampler by python. It tests the wrong algorithm descriped in Problem 1. of [Problem Set 3](chrome-extension://ikhdkkncnoglghljlkmcimlnlhkeamad/pdf-viewer/web/viewer.html?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comp.nus.edu.sg%2F~gilbert%2FCS5234%2F2016%2Fpsets%2Fpset3.pdf) 

The result of the sketch.py shows that only a few of the initial graph nodes can be reconstructed, and the sketch will become empty far before it output all the nodes.
