the sea thousands of people stood by the river to watch it they were all excited and happy on the terra nova captain robert falcon scott smiled quietly it was a very important day for him he was a strong man not very tall in the blue clothes of a captain he was forty one years old but he had a young face like a boy his eyes were dark and quiet one man on the ship titus oates smiled at scott what an exciting day captain he said look at those people i feel like an important man scott laughed you are important titus he said and you re going to be famous too we all are do you see this flag he looked at the big british flag at the back of the ship and smiled at oates that flag is coming with us he said in the antarctic i m going to carry it under my clothes we re going to be the first men at the south pole and that flag is going to be first too five days later on june th a man opened the door of his wooden house in norway he was a tall man with a long face he waited outside the house for a minute everything was very quiet he could see no houses only mountains trees and wa ter it was nearly dark the sky was black over the mountains the man smiled and walked quickly away from the house down to the sea in the water a big wooden ship waited for him the man got onto the ship and talked and laughed quietly with his friends the ship s name was fram and the man was roald amundsen the fram was the most beautiful ship on earth amundsen thought his friends were the best skiers on earth too one of them olav bjaaland smiled at him north pole here we come captain he said yes amundsen said his friends could not see his face in the dark fram is going to the arctic everyone on the fram was ready to go to the north pole to the arctic amundsen wanted to go there too but first he wanted to go south his friends didn t know that at midnight on june th the fram moved quietly away from amundsen s house out to sea chapter the race the fram went to an island in the south of norway it was a very little island with only one small wooden house two trees and nearly a hundred dogs look at that bjaaland said it s an island of dogs there are dogs in the water near the trees on the house dogs everywhere two men came out of the house hassel lindstrom amundsen said it s good to see you how many dogs do you have for me ninety nine roald said hassel the best ninety nine dogs from greenland and they re very happy they don t work they just eat and play all day they re having a won derful summer here good good amundsen laughed but that s finished now hey bjaaland stop laughing come down here and help me let s get all these dogs onto the ship it was not easy the dogs were fat and strong and they didn t want to go on the ship but at last after three hours hard work all ninety nine were on the ship and the fram went out to sea again the men were not happy the weather was bad the dogs were dirty and some of the men were ill they began to ask questions why are we bringing dogs witn us asked one man johansen we re going thousands of kilometres south past cape horn and then north to alaska why not wait and get dogs in alaska don t ask me said his friend helmer hanssen i don t understand it the men talked for a long time then on september th amundsen called everyone to the back of the ship he stood quietly and looked at them behind him was a big map it was not a map of the arctic it was a map of antarctica bjaaland looked at helmer hanssen and laughed then amundsen began to speak boys he said i know you are unhappy you often ask me difficult questions and i don t answer well i m going to an swer all those questions now today we began to work for this journey two years ago then we wanted to be the first men at the north pole but last year peary an american found the north pole so america was first to the north pole not norway we re going there but we re too late i don t understand this bjaaland thought why is amundsen talking about the north pole with a map of antarctica behind him amundsen stopped for a minute and looked at all the men slowly no one said anything we have to go a long way south before we get to alaska he said very near antarctica you know and captain scott the englishman is going to the south pole this year he wants to put his british flag there an american flag at the north pole a british flag at the south pole bjaaland began to understand he started to smile and couldn t stop he was warm and excited well boys amundsen said slowly do we want the british to put their flag at the south pole first how fast can we travel we have a lot of dogs and some of the most won derful skiers on earth bjaaland here is the best in norway so i have an idea boys let s go to the south pole and put the norwegian flag there before the british what do you say for a minute or two it was very quiet amundsen waited and the men watched him and thought then bjaaland laughed yes he said why not it s a ski race isn t it and the english can t ski it s a wonderful idea of course let s go chapter the ponies on october th the terra nova arrived in wellington new zealand when scott came off the ship a newspa per man walked up to him captain scott captain scott can i talk to you please he said scott stopped and smiled yes of course he said what do you want to know are you going to win the man asked win scott asked win what win the race to the south pole of course the newspaper man said it s a race between you and amundsen now look at this he gave a newspaper to scott scott looked at it it said scott s face went white give me that he said he took the newspaper and read it carefully the newspaper man watched him and waited well captain scott he said at last who s going to win this race tell me that scott looked at him angrily this is stupid he said it s not a race i came here to learn about the antarctic i m not interested in amundsen or in races then he walked back on to his ship with the newspaper in his hand later that day he talked to his men he gave them the newspaper and laughed it doesn t matter he said we re in front of amundsen and we have more men and more money he has only eight men and a lot of dogs i know about dogs they don t work in the antarctic we have sixteen men and the new motor sledges they are much better and tomorrow the ponies are coming we need ponies motor sledges and good strong british men that s all forget about amundsen he s not important scott asked oates to look after the ponies but he did not let oates buy them when oates first saw the ponies in new zealand he was very unhappy most of the ponies were old and some of them were ill they re beautiful ponies titus scott said they come from china they re wonderful ponies oates looked at them angrily and said nothing then he asked where is their food captain here scott opened a door oates looked inside he thought for a minute we need more food than this captain scott these ponies are going to work in the coldest place on earth they need a lot of food more than this scott smiled quietly we can t take more food on this ship titus where can we put it but it doesn t matter old boy they re very strong ponies you know the best ponies on earth later that night oates wrote a letter to his mother there are nineteen ponies on the terra nova now he wrote all the penies are in a small room at the front of the ship we eat our food in the room under the ponies so our table is often wet and dirty scott makes a lot of mistakes i think and antarc tica is a very dangerous place chapter food depots the two ships terra nova and fram arrived in antarctica in january at the end of summer the englishmen and the norwegians wanted to stay on the ice all winter they wanted to be ready to go to the south pole at the beglnning of the next antarctic summer the dogs pulled the norwegians sledges they ran quickly over the snow and pulled the big sledges from the ship onto the ice the men ran beside them on skis they put a big wooden house on the ice the house was full of food and skis and sledges they called it framheim out side the house the dogs lived in holes under the snow when the house was ready the men made their first journey south before the winter they wanted to take a lot of food south and leave it in depots for the long journey to the pole they needed a lot of food and they couldn t carry it all with them on february th five men three sledges eighteen dogs and half a tonne of food left framheim and went south it was easy the weather was warm for the antarctic be tween centigrade and centigrade the snow was good and the dogs and skis went fast they went fifty or sixty kilometres every day after four days they reached south and made the first depot amundsen made his depot very carefully it was very im portant to find it again next summer so he put a big black flag on top then he put ten flags to the east of the depot each flag half a kilometre from the next and ten flags to the west so there were flags for five kilometres to the left of the depot and five kilometres to the right then they went back to framheim and took some more food south this time to south this time it was harder the temperature was sometimes centigrade and there were strong winds with a lot of snow the dogs and men were very tired and the tents and boots were bad at the second depot they put out sixty flags to help them find it again they came back to framheim on march rd it was nearly winter in the antarctic their ship fram was far away now near south america they were alone on the ice oates went with scott to make the first british depot they left cape evans on january th there were thirteen men eight ponies and twenty six dogs the dogs were faster than the ponies they ran quickly over the top of the snow but the ponies feet went through it every morning the ponies started first and the dogs started two hours later because they ran faster at night the dogs made warm holes under the snow but the ponies stood on top of the snow it was centigrade after fifteen days oates talked to scott there was a strong wind and the two men s faces were white with snow three of these ponies are ill captain oates said they can t go on don t be stupid oates scott answered they re good strong animals the best ponies on earth not these three oates said they re ill and unhappy and now they can t walk let s kill them and leave the meat here in the snow we can eat it or the dogs can of course not scott said angrily these ponies are our friends they work hard for us i don t kill my friends three days later two of the ponies were dead scott s men were slower than amundsen s it took them twenty four days to get to south they made a big depot there and put one large black flag on top of it then they went back to cape evans their camp was on an island in the ice and the sea ice moved sometimes there were holes in the ice and black sea water under it one day seven ponies went through the ice into the sea and died one motor sledge also went into the sea chapter a long cold winter it was dark for four months outside the wooden house at framheim it was often centigrade the dogs lived in warm holes under the snow the men stayed in the house and worked in their rooms under the snow the skis and sledges came from the best shops in norway but bjaaland wasn t happy with them he changed a lot of things on the skis and sledges soon the sledges were stronger than before the skis were better and faster too all the norwegians worked hard they looked after their dogs and worked on their equipment the sledges skis tents every day they thought about their journey to the pole and talked about it and every day amundsen thought about scott one day in midwinter he talked to his men let s start early before scott amundsen said remem ber scott has more men than us and he has motor sledges too perhaps they can go faster than us bjaaland laughed oh no they can t go faster than me he said on snow nothing can go faster than a good man on skis we don t know amundsen said you re the best skier in norway but you get tired and dogs get tired too motor sledges don t get tired they can go all day and all night johansen laughed angrily that s stupid he said perhaps the motor sledges can go all night but the englishmen can t the english can t win roald they don t understand snow but we do and they re too slow perhaps amundsen said but i want to win this race so we re going to start early do you understand it was quiet and warm inside framheim bjaaland looked at amundsen and thought about the long cold journey in front of him he thought about the dogs in their holes under the snow and listened to the wind over the house when roald he said quietly on august th the sun comes back on that day we start then but we can t johansen said he looked angry and un happy that s too early we can t start then it s danger ous and stupid amundsen looked at johansen coldly you re wrong jo hansen he said we want to win remember so we start on august th bjaaland listened to the winter wind outside in scott s camp at cape evans no one talked about amundsen and no one worked hard they had good food and they played football on the snow they wrote a newspaper the south polar times and read books no one learnt to ski no one worked on the motor sledges twice men went for long jour neys across the snow they walked and pulled the sledges themselves oates stayed at cape evans and looked after his ponies over the window in cape evans scott put a map of antarc tica with a pen he made a line from cape evans to the south pole and he put a little britisn flag at the pole under the map scott wrote the day for the start of their journey we start on november rd he wrote chapter a bad start on august rd the norwegians sledges were ready they took them outside and the dogs pulled them across me ice the sun came up for half an hour but it was too cold centigrade they could not travel in that weather they went back to framheim and waited they waited two weeks until september th then with the temperature at centigrade they started they ran happily across the snow to the south eight men seven sledges and eighty six dogs only lindstrom the cook stayed behind in framheim at first everything went well they went twenty eight kilo metres on saturday and twenty eight kilometres on sunday it was easy then on monday the temperature went down to centigrade there was white fog in front of their faces they couldn t see anything but they travelled twenty eight kilometres that night in their tents they nearly died of cold next day they stopped and made snow houses inside the snow houses it was warm but everyone was unhappy i told you roald johansen said even september is too early we can t travel in this cold do you want us to die let s go back and wait for better weather amundsen was very angry he was angry with johansen buthe was angry with himself too he knew johansen was right all right he said slowly we can go on to the depot at south leave the food there and then go back we can t do more than that it was thirty seven kilometres to the depot the wind was in their faces all day two dogs died on the way at the depot they did not stop they put out the food and the flags turned round and went north at last the wind was behind them the dogs ran quickly and the men sat on the empty sledges they went faster and faster it was like a race amundsen was on wisting s sledge and soon he wisting and hanssen were three or four kilometres in front soon they were alone they travelled seventy five kilo metres in nine hours and they reached framheim at four o clock that afternoon bjaaland arrived two hours later with two more men but the last two johansen and prestrud went more slowly their dogs were tired their feet were wet and cold they had no food and they were alone in the dark the temperature was centigrade they reached framheim at midnight next morning johansen was angry in front of everyone he said you were wrong roald september was too early i told you but you didn t listen and then you left us alone and we nearly died in the cold you re a bad captain i m a better captain than you are amundsen was very angry but at first he said nothing be cause he knew that johansen was right then that evening he gave a letter to johansen it said you aren t coming to the pole with me when i go south you can take some dogs and go east to king edward land you can go with prestrud and stubberud you can be the first men to go there but not to the south pole the norwegians stayed in framheim and waited they lay in bed listened to the wind outside and thought about scott and his motor sledges chapter motor sledges and mountains scott had two motor sledges now they were the first motor sledges in the antarctic the first on earth on october th the motor sledges started south from cape evans four men went with them but scott stayed at cape evans for another week oates was unhappy he wrote to his mother we had a very bad winter here i don t like scott we were here all winter but he didn t learn to ski or to drive dogs our equipment is bad and he doesn t think about other people i m going to sleep in his tent on the journey but i don t want to on november lst scott and oates and six more men left cape evans with eight sledges and eight

then herbert said and you mr morris did you have three wishes yes i did morris answered i was young i wanted many things a fast car money morris stopped for a minute and then he said with difficulty my wife and my young son died in an accident in the car without them i didn t want the money so in the end i wished to lose it but it was too late my wife and my child were dead the room was very quiet the white family looked at the unhappy face of the old soldier then mr white said why do you want the paw now you don t need it you can give it to someone how can i give it to someone the soldier said the monkey s paw brings unhappiness with it well give it to me mr white said perhaps this time it no tom morris cried you re my friend i can t give it to you then after a minute he said i

dr frederick treves i am a doctor at the london hospital one day in i saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital i stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture at first i felt interested then i felt angry then afraid it was a horrible ugly picture there was a man in the picture but he did not look like you and me he did not look like a man he looked like an elephant i read the writing under the picture it said come in and see the elephant man pence i opened the door and went in there was a man in the shop he was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth what do you want he asked i d like to see the elephant man please i said the man looked at me angrily well you can t he said the shop s closing now you can come back tomorrow i m sorry i said but i would like to see him now i have no time tomorrow i have a lot of work to do but i can give you more than pence the man looked at me carefully then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth all right sir he said give me twelve pence then i gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop we went into a little room the room was cold and dark and there was a horrible smell in it a creature sat on a chair behind a table i say a creature because it was not a man or a woman like you or me the creature did not move or look at us it sat very quietly on the chair in the cold dark dirty room and looked at the table the creature had a cloth over its head because of the cold on the table in front of it there was a dead flower stand up said the shopkeeper loudly the creature stood up slowly it took the old cloth off its head and put it on the chair i looked at the creature and felt sad i am a doctor so i know a lot about accidents and ill people i see horrible ugly things every day but this creature this thing was the worst of all there were no men or women in the hospital like him he wore some old trousers but no shirt coat or shoes so i could see his body very well his head was the most interesting thing it was very very big like an enormous bag with a lot of books in it the head did not have much hair and there was another bag of brown dirty skin at the back of it this skin came down below his neck i could not see one of his eyes very well because a lot of skin came down in front of his face too an enormous red tooth came out of his mouth under his nose it looked like an elephant s tooth the mouth and nose were like holes in the face the face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad because the skin could not move

about him in a little book a nurse helped me merrick looked at her sometimes but she did not smile at him or talk to him i think she was afraid of him i think merrick was afraid too because he was very quiet at four o clock i took him back to the shop in a cab the next day i looked in the shop window again but the picture was not there chapter a letter to the times i did not see merrick again for two years then one day the police found him he had my card in his hand so they brought him to the london hospital he was very tired hungry and dirty so i put him to bed in a quiet little room but he could not stay at the hospital he was not ill and of course the beds in the hospital are for ill people we have no beds for hungry people or ugly people i told the hospital chairman mr cars gomm about merrick he listened carefully and then he wrote a letter to the editor of the times newspaper from the times december th a letter to the editor dear sir i am writing to you about a man in our

could live in the hospital for all his life we could give him a home chapter merrick s first home we gave merrick two rooms at the back of the hospital one room was a bathroom so he could have a bath every day soon his skin was much better and there was no horrible smell the second room had a bed table and chairs i visited him every day and talked to him he loved reading and talking about books at first he did not know many books the bible and one or two newspapers that s all but i gave him some books of love stories and he liked them very much he read them again and again and talked about them often for him the men and women in these books were alive like you and me he was very happy but sometimes it was difficult for him at first one or two people in the hospital laughed at merrick because he was ugly sometimes they brought their friends to look at him one day a new nurse came to the hospital and nobody told her about merrick she took his food to his room and opened the door then she saw him she screamed dropped the food on the floor and ran out of the room i was very angry with the nurse and went to see merrick he was not happy about it but he was not very angry i think he felt sorry for the girl people don t like looking at me i know that dr treves he said they usually laugh or scream well i don t want nurses to laugh at you joseph i said angrily i want them to help you thank you doctor he said in his strange slow voice but it s not important everyone laughs at me i understand that i looked at him sadly in his one good hand his left hand he had the little picture of his mother he looked at the picture for a minute and then put it by a flower on the table a tear ran out of his eye and down the skin of his enormous ugly face dr treves he said slowly you and the nurses arevery kind and i m very happy here thank you very much but i know i can t stay here long and i would like to live in a lighthouse after the hospital please a lighthouse or a home for blind people i think those are the best places for me what do you mean i ashed why he did not look at me he put the flower on the picture and looked at it carefully lighthouses have sea all round them don t they he said nobody could look at me in a lighthouse so i would be happy there and blind people can see nothing so they couldn t see me could they but joseph i said this is your home you live here now

t you understand you can stay here all your life very carefully i told him about the letter to the times and the money i don t think he understood at first so i told him again he was very quiet for a minute then he stood up and walked up and down the room very quickly a strange sound came from him like laughing chapter an important visitor i did not want merrick to live by himself like a man in a lighthouse he read his books and talked to me but i wanted him to talk to more people and i wanted him to talk to women merrick read about women in his books but he did not often talk to women he met the nurses every day but they did not talk to him very much for them he was always a creature not a man one day one of my friends a beautiful young woman came to the hospital i told her about merrick and took her to his room she opened the door and smiled at him good morning mr merrick she said then she shook his hand merrick looked at her for a minute with his mouth open then he sat down on his bed with his head in his hand and cried he cried for nearly five minutes the tears ran down his face between his fingers and onto the floor my friend sat on the bed beside him and put her hand on his arm she said nothing but she smiled at him and shookhis hand again before she left dr treves he said to me that night that lady was wonderful my mother smiled at me once many years ago but no women smile at me now but this lady smiled at me too and she shook my hand a beautiful lady smiled at me and shook my hand my young lady friend came again the next week and talked to merrick for half an hour the week after that she came again with a friend they gave him some books and had a cup of tea with him it was wonderful for him for the first time in his life he had some friends he was a very

visitors never laughed at him he began to feel like a man not a creature one wonderful day a very important lady came to the hospital to visit him i met the lady and took her to his room then i opened the door and smiled at him good morning joseph i said there is a new visitor to see you today a very famous lady merrick stood up beside his table he did not smile because his face could not smile but

with his mouth open then he spoke in his strange slow voice how how do you do your majesty he said but i don t think the queen understood him because he tried to get down on his knees at the same time it was very difficult for him because of his enormous legs no please mr merrick do get up said the queen i would like to talk to you can we sit at your table yes yes of course he said they sat at the table she took his left hand the good hand in hers she looked at the hand carefully and then smiled at merrick again i often read about you in the newspapers she said you are a very interesting man mr

more like a child than a man he could read about things and talk to his visitors but he could not go out of the hospital by himself he thought and played like a child after christmas he wanted to go to the theatre this was very difficult because i did not want the people in the theatre to see him but a kind lady from the theatre mrs kendal helped us we bought tickets for a box at the side of the theatre we went to the theatre in a cab with dark windows and we went into the theatre by a door at the back the queen s door nobody saw us three nurses sat at the front of the box and merrick and i sat in the dark behind them nobody in the theatre could see us but we could see the play it was a children s christmas play merrick loved it it was a most wonderful exciting story often he laughed and sometimes he tried to sing like the children in the theatre he was like a child for him everything in the story was true once he was very afraid because the bad man in the play was angry and had a knife at first merrick wanted to leave the theatre but i stopped him then he was very angry with this bad man in the play he hit his hand on his chair and stood up and talked to the man but nobody heard him when the bad man went to prison merrick laughed merrick thought the beautiful young lady in the play was wonderful he wanted to talk to her too at the end of the play he was very happy because she married a good young man he remembered this play for a long time and he talked a lot about the people in it what do you think they did after we left he asked me where do the young lady and the young man live what are they doing now i don t know i said perhaps they live in the country merrick thought about this for a long time then he said dr treves can i go to the country please i saw the country once from a train but i never went there i often read about it in books it s very beautiful isn t it i would like to see it the visit to the theatre was difficult but a visit to the country was more difficult but again one of his new friends helped us she had a small house in the country and merrick could stay in it for the summer she said i took merrick to the country in a train with dark windows so nobody could see him then we went in a cab to the country house there were a lot of trees near the house but no people lived near it a countryman brought food to the house everyday but no people came near it i stayed with him that night at night it was very dark and quiet in the morning hundreds of birds sang in the trees and everything outside the house was green merrick walked under the big trees looking at things happily and singing his strange song i went back to london but merrick stayed there for six weeks he was wonderfully happy every week he wrote me a letter apple tree house west wickham berkshire st july dear dr treves i had a wonderful day again today it was very warm so i walked under the trees and sat by a stream the water in the stream made a beautiful noise like singing did you know that i listened to it for two hours lots of little birds came near me one had a red body in front and a brown back i gave it some bread and it sat on my hand a lot of birds are my friends now i watched the fish in the stream too they were very exciting because they move very fast one minute they were there and the next minute i couldn t see them but i waited quietly and they always came back i put my hand in the water but i couldn t touch them i met a big dog yesterday it made a very loud noise but i was not afraid i sat down quietly and looked it and it came and smelt my hand i saw it again today and gave it some bread it likes me now i am going to put some flowers from the country in this letter there are hundreds of flowers here did you know that i like the little blue ones best but they are all beautiful i have lots of them in my room i give them water every morning little flowers are very thirsty you know i am very happy here doctor but

she is only an opera singer we know nothing about her family but raoul did not listen to him good families were not im portant and young men never listen to their older brothers there were many people in christine daa s dressing room that night but there was a doctor with christine and her beautiful face looked white and ill raoul went quickly across the room and took her hand christine what s the

persian for weeks all paris talked about that night at the opera everybody asked questions but nobody knew the answers where was christine daa where was the vi comte de chagny were they alive or dead and the phantom of the opera some weeks after that famous night madame giry went out one afternoon to a small house near the rivoli gardens she went in and up the stairs to some rooms at the top of the house the persian opened the door madame giry looked at him my friend you know the an swers please tell me are they alive or dead come in the persian said quietly they sat down on some chairs by the window and looked out across the rivoli gardens yes the persian said slowly the phantom is dead now he did not want to live any longer i saw his body three days ago and because of that i can talk to you about him he can not kill me now so the phantom was really a man madame giry asked yes his name was erik that was not his real name of course he was born in france but i knew him in persia he was a famous builder and i worked with him there for a time i was his friend but not for long when he came to paris i came after him i wanted to watch him he was a very clever very dangerous man he could be in two or three places at the same time he could be in one place and his voice could come from another place he could do many clever things with ropes and mirrors and secret doors you see he helped to build the opera house he built secret passages underground and his secret house on the lake he could not live in the outside world because of his terrible ugly face unhappy erik we can feel sorry for him madame giry he was so clever and so ugly people screamed when they saw his face and so he lived this strange life half man half phantom but he was a man in the end he wanted a woman s love he stopped and madame giry asked quietly and christine daa and vicomte raoul what happened to them the persian smiled ah yes what happened to young raoul and the beautiful christine who knows

lies on the twenty seventh day of april the guards took my mother and james to lancaster castle and my life at read hall began suddenly it was spring the sky was blue and there were beautiful flowers on the hills from read hall pendle hill looked different it looked smaller and it was not so important in my life sometimes i walked along sabden brook to sabden and then to newchurch and i felt happy to be near pendle hill again but i never visited malkin tower again spring changed into summer and in august i went to lan caster with mr nowell lancaster was thirty miles from read hall and i got very tired because i sat on a horse for hours it was a big noisy town i never saw so many people before in my life and i felt afraid the trial of the witches of pendle began at lancaster castle on the eighteenth day of august and the judge was an impor tant man from london judge bromley listened to many people on that day because there were a lot of witches from lan cashire in the prison old demdike was not there because she died in may before the judge arrived i waited with mr nowell s servant and when a guard called my name i went through a big door and saw the judge behind a table judge bromley was rich and important but his eyes were cold suddenly i saw my mother she was dirty and very thin when she saw me her face went red my hair was clean now and i wore shoes and an expensive dress i saw my mother s eyes she hated me are you a witch judge bromley asked my mother no i m not my mother answered angrily did you kill jack robinson of barley village no i did not jennet device is here a voice said quietly it was mr nowell she can tell us the truth about her mother for a minute my mother did not move then she ran across the room and shouted at me you know nothing you

re my daughter and i know i was afraid and i put my hands over my eyes i didn t want to see my mother s ugly face the guards pulled my motherout of the room and the noise stopped jennet device the judge said tell us the truth about your mother roger nowell lifted me up and put me on a table in front of the judge my mother is a witch i began she has a friend a dog called ball when she wants to kill somebody she tells ball i talked and talked i told the judge everything judge bromley listened carefully my child is this the truth yes i answered i m telling you the truth the guards brought my mother back into the room again her face looked tired and her eyes were red elizabeth device your daughter told us about your dog ball your son too told us about the clay pictures we know everything my mother said nothing she didn t look at the judge and she didn t look at me next the guards brought my brother james into the room when i saw james i wanted to cry james was thin and dirty and his hair was very long he looked at the judge and at all the rich and important men in the room and he began to cry then he sat down on the floor stand up james device judge bromley said the guards pulled james up but he fell to the floor again you killed mr duckworth judge bromley said i wanted a shirt james cried is your brother a witch judge bromley asked me yes i said my brother sat on the floor his mouth open he looked at me but he didn t know me i was clean and fat because of all the good food at read hall james told me about his friend dandy i began dandy was the devil and james heard the name dandy and he began to cry again i want dandy i want to go home the guards pulled him up from the floor and took him out of the room i never saw my brother again when the guards brought my sister alizon in front of the judge i said nothing john law the pedlar came into the room he was a thin man now he walked slowly and he talked slowly and his face looked ill he told the judge about that day near colne when alizon cursed him and her dog ran after him i m sorry alizon said i was angry with you that day but i m sorry now alizon s eyes were dark and afraid but she had no friends in that room and nobody wanted to listen to her then mr nowell took me out and i waited with his servant in a different room an hour later there was the noise of many people shouting and crying the servant smiled the trial is finished he said you re a good child jennet you told the judge the truth about the witches mr nowell took me home to read hall and on the twen tieth day of august the guards took my mother my sis ter and my brother out of prison and hanged them in front of lancaster castle and so i lost my family when i was a child i wanted to be happy i wanted to be warm to wear shoes to eat good food i wanted someone to take care of me that s all my mother gave me nothing she gave me no love she never took care of me because my moth er was a witch my father ran away and i never knew him my father was a rich man without a name and i lived hungry and cold with a witch and so i told judge bromley the truth about my family was i wrong i don t know i was happy for years at read hall for twenty one years i forgot my family i learned to cook for the nowell family i worked many hours every day but i was warm and i ate good food every sunday in my best dress i went to church every summer i walked over pendle hill i never thought about my family because i was happy at read hall in august the guards hanged my family in front of lancaster castle but their dead faces waited for me there and a year ago in when the guards put me in the prison in lancaster castle i met them again day after day i see their ugly dead faces and hear their cold angry voices i think of them all the time god is with me here in prison i believe that but my dead family is with me too mr webster from the church at kildwick visits me again his blue eyes are tired but he smiles at me edmund robinson and his father told the truth in london he says quietly the child told lies about you be cause he was afraid of his father he wanted his father to love him i say nothing mr webster wants to be kind but he cannot help me mr nowell cannot help me because he is dead ed mund robinson is only a child he tells lies one day and the truth the next day but the truth cannot help me what can i do against hate and lies when mr nowell was alive the vil lagers didn t talk about me but when mr nowell died the lies began the villagers are all afraid of me because my name is device they hate me because my name is device they say i am a witch because my name is device i come from a family of witches but i am not a witch no body died because i cursed them i never made clay pictures i never had a cat or dog i only wanted to live quietly at read hall and watch the changing skies over pendle hill when i was a child i was always cold and hungry and i hated my family because they were witches in i told the truth and the truth killed my family now twenty two years later lies are going to kill me here in lancaster castle and i am cold and hungry again mr webster gives me bread and i go back into the prison i can never go back to read hall i know that now i must stay here in lancaster castle with my dead family they are watching me and waiting for me i can never be free of them this is my true story and i want to finish it now txtba www txtba com fotheringhay my name is bess curle but this is not my story it is the story of my lady mary queen of scots she wrote the story and then she gave it to me i am going to give it to her son she began the story a week ago it was january and we sat here in our cold room in fotheringhay castle in the north of england we couldn t see much from the window one or two houses a river some trees some horses and a road that s all the road goes to london the home of queen elizabeth of england mary sat with her little dog in her hands and watched it all day long no one came along the road nothing happened i watched mary unhappily please your majesty come away from that window i said it doesn t help no one is going to come queen eliza beth can t do it queens don t kill queens don t they bess mary said then why are we here in this prison why am i not free why your majesty because queen elizabeth is afraid of you that s right mary said she s afraid of me and she hates me too she hates me because i am beautiful and she is not because i had three husbands and she never married and because many people good catnolic people in england france scotland spain say that i mary am the true queen of england not elizabeth and elizabeth has no chil dren so when she is dead my son james she came away from the window and stood in front of me james she said quietly my son does he think about me sometimes he was only ten months old when i last saw him it is nearly twenty years of course he thinks about you your majesty i said you write to him often how can he forget his mother then why doesn t he write to me mary asked does he want me to say here in an english prison no of course not your majesty but he has a lot of work your majesty he is the king of scotland and he is not the king of scotland bess she said not before i am dead remember that no your majesty of course not but perhaps people tell him things that are untrue you know what people say per haps perhaps he thinks you killed his father mary s face went white she was very angry and for a minute i was afraid she said you know that s a lie bess it is a lie i did not kill james s father i knew nothing about it i know that your majesty but perhaps james doesn t know it he hears so many lies all the time he needs to know the true story why don t you write and tell him mary sat down slowly she looked old and tired all right bess she said give me a pen please i m going to write to james and tell him the true story you can give it to him when i m dead dead your majesty don t say that you aren t going to die her old tired eyes looked at me yes i am bess you know what is going to happen one day soon a man is going to bring a letter from queen elizabeth and then her men are going to kill me but before i die i would like to write to my son james i want to tell him the story of my life so give me a pen please i gave her a pen this is what she wrote france dear james very soon i am going to die and meet my god before i die i want to write the true story of my life for you everything that i write here is true i cannot lie to you or to god please believe that james it s important to me my father died when i was one week old so i was the queen of scots when i was a baby at first i lived with my mother in scotland and then when i was five i went to france my mother was french but she stayed in scotland and died there i went to france to marry the king of france s son his name was francis and he was one year younger than me in his father died so francis was king then i was queen of france and queen of scotland too i was very happy in france francis my husband was like a little brother to me i think he loved me bur he was very young and he was often ill and then in he died he was sixteen years old when he died i was very unhappy and my life was very different there was a new king and queen and i wasn t important in france any more but i was still queen of scots so i came back to scotland when i arrived in scotland i was a young girl of eighteen my mother was dead and there was no one there to meet me i walked off the ship and i slept in a little house near the sea next day the scots lords came from edinburgh they were pleased to see me and for a week everyone was happy people smiled at me and sang in the streets i think everyone liked me then that sunday i went to church james my son you are a protestant and i am a catholic you are a good man and you love god but your church and my church are enemies i was born a catholic and i am going to die a catholic i love god too i hope you understand that i m not going to change now that sunday people shouted angrily in the streets your majesty said the scots lords scotland is a protestant coun try you can t go to a catholic church here the scottish people don t like catholics i m sorry my lords i said but i am your queen no one tells me what to do i don t hate protestants and i m not going to kill them the people can go to their protestant churches and pray to god there but i m going to pray with catholics in my church people were angry because of that a man called john knox came to see me he was a famous protestant churchman but i didn t like him he was a big angry man with black clothes he hated the catholic church and wanted all catholics to leave scotland to him the protestant church was the only true church of god he said your majesty you re a young woman like my daughter women can t understand difficult things like god or the church find a good protestant husband girl let him rule this country for you i was very angry with this man knox i was a queen but i was only eighteen he didn t talk quietly he shouted at me i cried because of his angry words i could not understand him he talked so much and he knew so many books but i did not go to his church he was right about one thing perhaps i could rule scotland without a man but i could not have a child without one and every queen needs a son or daughter to come after her so i began to look for a husband darnley and riccio at first i wanted to marry the son of the king of spain don carlos but he was a catholic of course and my scots lords did not like that it was difficult for me james i wanted to please myself i wanted to please my friends and family in france and to please my people too and then there was the queen of england at first i wanted very much to be friends with elizabeth we wrote many letters and talked about a meeting a meet ing between two sister queens elizabeth wrote to me at this time our two countries need to be friends you need a husband i need a friend why not marry my friend robert dudley the earl of leicester he is a tall strong man i think he could be a good husband for you i was very angry about this letter there were a lot of sto ries about elizabeth and robert dudley they were good friends he often danced and sang and talked with her some times people said he stayed in her room all night dudley had a wife but one day she died very suddenly it was an ac cident she fell down the stairs they say but then perhaps she was unhappy because of her husband and elizabeth and she writes to me about a man like this i thought she wants him to marry me because he is her friend her lover perhaps she wants her lover to be king of scotland i found a better man than dudley james i found henry darnley your father he was nineteen years old and i was twenty three he was a tall man with a beautiful face and big green eyes he talked and sang well and i liked dancing with him he often wore expensive black clothes and he laughed a lot when he was with me he was very young and friendly and i felt happy when i was with him i liked him very much and i thought he loved me too he was an important man too we were cousins his grandfather was king of scots and his great grandfather was henry vii of england in july i married him elizabeth was very angry and so were a lot of the scots lords my half brother the earl of moray tried to stop the marriage i had to fight him and he ran south to england but i was happy your father and i laughed every day he was now henry king of scots after one or two weeks the laughter stopped a king has a lot of work james you know that he has to read hundreds of letters talk to people and think about a lot of important things i did those things every day but now i thought i had a man to help me my lord henry i said would you like to read all the letters with me you can sit next to me and you can work with me every day your father looked unhappy i m not interested in work like that he said i don t understand it of course not i said you re a young man my love but i can teach you for one or two days he sat down with me and i tried to teach him but it was true he was not interested in the work and he did not try to understand it you do it mary he said i m going out with my friends we re going to ride and drink and swim so i did all the work at night too he often went out with his friends in the town they drank a lot and laughed and sang and there were often fights but no one said anything because he was the king my husband what could people say they were unhappy but they were afraid of him some of them went to england to the earl of moray at this time i was often very tired because i was pregnant you my son james were alive inside me but i did all the work of a queen and i needed friends too one of these friends was a young italian david riccio riccio was a little man and he was not tall or beautiful or strong but he was a very clever interesting man he wrote many of my letters for me and helped me he sang well too and i sometimes sang with him in the evenings i liked him very much and at first your father liked him too but then moray s friends began to talk about me and ric cio david riccio is in the queen s rooms every night they said to your father she laughs and sings and dances with him my lord it is not right he is not a scotsman and he is not her husband he is always with her perhaps they said other things too i don t know a lot of scots lords listened to them but i tell you james before god i did nothing wrong david riccio was a good man he worked hard and he helped me so of course i liked him your father did not work he went out to the town every night with his friends and drank and then one night your father came home the death of david riccio it was a saturday evening in march i was in edin burgh with some friends david riccio was there with six or seven other people we were in a small room but there was a good dinner on the table and we were happy it was dark outside but inside it was warm and friendly suddenly a door opened behind me in the door was henry darnley my husband i stood up and smiled good evening my lord i said please come in would you like something to eat no thank you he said i m not hungry but i want to sit next to you wife please tell that man to move a man got out of the chair next to me and darnley sat beside me then he put his arms round me i did not like it his face was hot and his eyes looked unhappy but i smiled and said i m happy to see you my lord are you mary he laughed are you really yes of course my lord but then the second door opened and his friend lord ruthven stood there he had a knife in his hand his face was red and he looked very angry af first no one moved then ruthven said your majesty send david riccio out of this room now i want him i looked at riccio he was afraid why i said why do you want him he is a bad wicked man ruthven said send him out no i said you want to kill him david riccio is my friend he stays here with me he goes out woman lord ruthven said king henry hold your wife please i stood up but darnley held my arms and i could not move david riccio ran behind me and held my dress my friends in the room stood up too and moved towards ruthven angrily but he had a knife in his hand get back he said angrily don t touch me then five men with knives ran into the little room and there was a fight one man held a knife in my face and an other man hit david riccio behind me then they pulled him out of the room help me he screamed help me my queen please they re going to kill me don t aaaaaargh i couldn t help him because darnley had me in his arms but i could hear david riccio s screams i think he fell down the stairs and he screamed for two or three minutes then it was quiet what are you doing i asked darnley angrily riccio is a good man why are you doing this darnley laughed you are my wife mary not david ric cio s he said so why are you with him every evening you never talk to me i don t talk to you because you are never here i said you are always drinking with your friends you aren t a king you re a stupid boy he laughed again it was not a nice laugh well he said perhaps i am a boy but that is better than david riccio now do you want to go and see him i did see him five minutes after that he was very dead and there was blood all over the floor poor david riccio he sings to god now not me i looked at henry darnley my husband he had a stupid smile on his face but i think he was afraid of me i looked at him a long time and the smile went away remember this night husband i said to him remem ber it well think about it when you look into my eyes and before you go to sleep david riccio was my friend and you killed him in front of me i m never going to forget that henry darnley never my son is born next morning darnley came to see me he was afraid

afraid they re going to kill me and you too think of our child mary here inside you he took me in his arms again i was very angry i am sorry james that this man was your father he was a stupid boy not a man he was tall and strong and beautiful but he could never think like a man or a king i said you know these men henry what do they want they they want our child mary they don t want us they re going to put you in prison they don t want you to be queen they want your child to be king or queen i i don t know what they want to do with me perhaps they want you to be king too without me i said quietly then you can do what they say like a little boy perhaps mary they said that yesterday but now that moray s here i don t know i m afraid please help me he began to cry again what can we do we can run away i said we can leave edinburgh quick ly and quietly before ruthven and his men stop us be quiet for a minute i want to think i walked up and down for two or three minutes then i said henry

god james i did not kill your father it was not me i knew nothing about it nothing i sang and danced in town and then went to bed in edin burgh castle then at two o clock in the morning there was a sudden noise a very big bang everybody heard it all through the town my god i said what s that everyone ran out of their rooms lord bothwell was down stairs don t be afraid ladies he said my men are out side they re going to see what it is after an hour he came to see me please sit down my lady he said i have some unhappy news yes my lord what is it it s your husband lord darnley he is dead but how how did he die who killed him i don t know my lady that bang that was his house kirk o field it s not there any more what and darnley was inside well no my lady bothwell said slowly my men found him in the garden not in the house he is wearing only night clothes and there is no blood on him but he is dead i am sorry take me out there i want to see him now yes my lady i went out to kirk o field in the early morning there was no house now no walls no doors no windows nothing and there in the garden a long way from the house was that poor dead boy my husband i did not love him but i cried then he was your father james and i did not kill him i don t know who killed him but he had many enemies in scotland i was very afraid i too had enemies and i often slept there perhaps someone wanted to kill me too bothwell soon everyone in europe heard the news the queen of france and the queen of england wrote angry letters to me who killed the king they asked i was very unhappy at this time james we looked for the killers but we could not find them please believe me james the scots lords are difficult men some were friends some were enemies but they changed all the time many people in scotland said bothwell killed lord darn ley i heard them outside the castle and in the town but i never believed it people in edinburgh sold horrible stories and pictures of bothwell the same day that darnley died it was too soon perhaps darnley s killers wrote these stories about bothwell before they killed darnley i don t think lord bothwell killed your father james he was a good friend to me in difficult times he was a good strong clever man and he worked hard i liked that a lot of women liked him i think three times that spring he asked me to marry him he had a wife and i could not marry again so soon i asked him to wait then on th april i rode out of edinburgh to the north i had five or six friends with me six miles outside the town lord bothwell met us with an army why are you here my lord i said he smiled because i want to meet you mary he said i want you to come with me to my castle he rode next to me and his men rode between me and my friends i was afraid and a little excited too but my lord you can t do this i said i don t want to come with you now but i want you mary he said your friends can t stop me i love you and i want to marry you what s wrong with that i said nothing what could i say i liked him and he had an army i had only six friends so i rode with him to his cas tle in dunbar and stayed there two weeks and then he was a strong man and i was only a woman and i did like him james i liked him very much after two weeks in dunbar bothwell and i rode back to edinburgh his wife did not want him and was happy to di vorce him so on th may i married him he was a good man james a much better man than your father i needed a strong man to help me rule the country but i was wrong i understand that now all the scots lords were afraid of bothwell and many of them were his ene mies they had an army and on th june bothwell and i rode out to fight them we met them at carberry hill it was a hot day and the two big armies stood and looked and waited their army had a big flag with a picture of your poor dead father darnley on it under the picture there were the words find my killers oh god come on my lord i said to bothwell our army is bet ter than theirs let s fight them both well rode up and down and talked to his men but they didn t want to fight they talked and looked at the flag and waited then some of them walked home at five o clock that evening lord kirkcaldy rode from his army to talk to us he said to me my lady leave your hus band and come with us we don t want men to die and so because our men didn t want to fight i went with him it was a very bad day for me they took me back to ed inburgh and people in the streets screamed at me kill the woman she sleeps with her husband s killer we want james to be king kill her now i was unhappy and afraid and i was pregnant again they took me to lochleven castle and put me in a room like a prison there i did not eat for two weeks and bothwell s children there were two babies wer born

today james is the new king of scots but because he is a child the earl of moray my half brother can rule the country for him because i was afraid and tired and ill i wrote my name on the letter mary

lochleven for a year a lot of people in europe were angry about that queen elizabeth wrote to the earl of moray you cannot keep a queen in prison she said it is very wrong i was pleased about that but moray didn t listen lord douglas lived in the castle and his young son william liked me one day there was a wedding in the castle people sang and danced and drank william douglas gave me some old women s clothes i put the clothes on and walked quietly out of the castle with him he shut the castle door behind us to keep his father s friends in then we got on some horses and rode away through the night all my friends came back to me soon i had a big army mary is our queen again people said give her back her son you were in earl moray s castle james so i came to fight him i rode with my army to langside near glasgow and there there james there my son i lost the fight i am so sorry i had many good strong men in my army but earl moray s men were stronger many of my men died and some ran away after the fight i ran away too i did not want to go to prison again so i rode south to england queen elizabeth wants to help me i thought she understands she wrote to moray and she is a queen like me i can come back to scotland with her army kill moray and find my baby son james i am in england but i am free i can try again i was wrong about that too very wrong england elizabeth didn t give me her army she put me in prison you know this james it is the story of your life not mine i was twenty five years old when i came to england and i am forty five now twenty years in english prisons moray told lies about me mary and bothwell killed darn ley he said mary slept with riccio and bothwell and killed her husband but it s not true they re all lies jameswicked lies they only said these things because i am a woman and a catholic and they don t want a catholic queen in scotland they want a protestant king a king like you james why james my son don t you help me why are you friendly with elizabeth my enemy you don t want me back in scotland do you you believe these lies don t you you talk to moray and his friends every day but they lied about me james moray and his friends killed riccio then killed your father too they stole my husband bothwell stole my son stole my son s love i am sorry james forgive me sometimes i get very angry it is difficult not to be angry when you are in prison for twenty years elizabeth didn t know what to do sometimes she believed moray sometimes she didn t she was afraid to kill me be cause i was a queen she was afraid to let me go free bcause i have friends in england the english catholics want me to be queen of england not her and she is a woman with no husband and no son so she hates me too sometimes the english catholics write to me and ask me for help and sometimes i write to them sometimes elizabeth s men find these letters the english protestants want to kill me because of these letters you are a wicked woman they say you killed your husband darnley and now you want to kill our queen elizabeth you re going to die i did not kill my husband i said and when l came to england i did not want to kill your queen i asked her for help i wanted to go back to scotand but my lords she put me in prison for twenty years twenty years my lords i want to be free don t you understand that when men write to me and try to help me then yes sometimes i write back why not is that wicked do you think they didn t listen of course not they want to kill me and so they wrote to queen elizabeth and now i sit here in fotheringhay castle and wait for her to answer i do not want to die james my son but i do not want to live all my life in an english prison i am old and tired of life think well of me james my son and a death queen mary stopped writing then yesterday afternoon th february we heard a horse outside our win dow mary looked out there was a man there on the road from london he had a letter from the queen of england in the evening an englishman lord shrewsbury came to see mary i am sorry my lady he said but i have a letter from my queen you re going to die tomorrow mary did not move when she asked quietly at half past eight in the morning he said i am very sorry my lady he went away we did not sleep much that night we talked and prayed to god and she gave me her letter to her son james give it to him bess please she said and tell him how i died yes my lady i said and so now i am going to tell you king james this is how your mother died at six o clock she got up prayed and dressed she put on a red petticoat first then a black dress and a white veil over the dress the veil came from her head to her feet she could see out through it but we could not see her face she looked like a woman on her wedding day when the englishmen came we went downstairs with her her little dog walked beside her under the veil but the eng lishmen didn t see that six of us went into a big room with her a hundred people stood and watched a protestant churchman came to talk to her my lady he said pray with me no she said thank you but no i was born a catholic and i m going to die a catholic i think god understands that she prayed for five minutes and then stood up the executioner came towards her he was a big strong man with an axe and something black over his face i am sorry my lady he said i don t hate you but this is my work please forgive me of course i forgive you mary said i am old and tired and you re going to open my prison doors for me i am going to see god do your work well then she looked at me and her friends don t cry for me ladies she said please don t cry now she could not walk to the block so the executioner helped her he took off her white veil and then he took off her black dress and put it on the floor she stood there in her red pet ticoat with a smile on her face then the executioner put something over her eyes very slowly mary put her head on the block the lord my god is my one true friend she said i give my life oh god into your hands then the executioner lifted his axe once twice oh god three times and her head her poor poor head fell on the floor it was very quiet in the room after that it is a little thing a head a very little thing but there was so much blood blood on her red petticoat blood on her black dress and her white veil blood on the executioner s shoes blood all over the floor blood blood everywhere we all looked and said nothing the executioner put down his axe and stood quietly and then mary s little dog came out from under her bloody dress and veil and walked slowly un happily through the blood towards her head my lord the story of your poor mother s life finishes here we her friends cry for her but that is how your mother died she died like a queen a good lady and a famous queen mary queen of scots txtba www txtba com toby remembers my name is toby i m an old man eighty three this spring my house is right in the middle of stratford upon avon and i can watch the street market from my window but i live very quietly now i m just an old man sitting in a chair i once knew the greatest man in england for thirty years i

shakespeare was his name i saw all his plays in the theatre people loved them they shouted laughed and cried ate oranges and called for more all kinds of people kings queens princes great lords and ladies poor people the boys who held the horses everyone will shakespeare could please them all he put me in a play once well he used my name toby twelfth night was the play i remember sir toby belch he was a big fat man who liked drinking too much and having a good time queen elizabeth the first watched that play on twelfth night the th of january she liked it too will s dead now of course he s been dead more than thirty years and no one sees his plays now the puritans have closed all the theatres there s no singing no dancing no plays it wasn t like that in my young days we had a good time in london will and i i ve no teeth now and my hair has all fallen out but i can still think and remember i remember when will and i were young just boys really stratford upon avon it was a sunny day in october when i first met will just outside stratford near a big field of apple trees i saw a boy up in one of the trees he had red hair and looked about two years older than me what are you doing up there i called just getting a few apples he said smiling those are farmer nash s apples i said and he ll send his dogs after you if he sees you mr nash has gone to market the boy said come on they re good apples the next minute i was up the tree with him but will was wrong farmer nash wasn t at the market and a few minutes later we saw his angry red face above the wall on the far side of the field will and i ran like the wind and only stopped when we reached the river we sat down to eat our apples will was fifteen and lived in henley street he told me his father was john shakespeare and he had a sister joan and two younger brothers gilbert and richard there was another sister who died i learnt later and the next year he had another brother little edmund the baby of the family now what about you he asked there s only me and my sister i said my parents are dead and we live with my mother s brother he s a shoe maker in ely street and i work for him what do you do i go to mr jenkins school in church street will said every day from seven o clock until five o clock not sundays of course i was sorry for him isn t is boring i asked sometimes usually it s all right he lay back and put his hands behind his head but we have to read and learn all these latin writers i want to read modern writers and eng lish writers like geoffrey chaucer can you read he asked of course i can read i said i went to school will sat up and began to eat another apple i want to be a writer he said a poet i want that more than anything in the world we were friends from that day until the day he died we met nearly every day and he taught me a lot about books and poetry and writers he always had his nose in a book when will left school he worked for his father in henley street john shakespeare was a glove maker and he had other business too like buying and selling sheep but will wasn t interested what are we going to do toby he said to me one day we can t spend all our lives making shoes and gloves well i said we could run away to sea and be sailors sail round the world like francis drake drake sailed back to plymouth in after his three year journey round the world but we were still in stratford we made lots of plans but nothing ever came of them will was still reading a lot and he was already writing poems himself he sometimes showed them to me and i said they were very good i didn t really know anything about poetry then but he was my friend will was not happy with his writing i ve got so much to learn toby he said so much to learn poor will he had a lot to learn about women too one day in october he came to my house with a long face i ll never leave stratford he said why not i asked we ll get away one day you ll see perhaps you will he said but i m going to be married in a few weeks time to anne hathaway my mouth fell open and stayed open married to anne hathaway is that the hathaways over at shottery yes will said i was working on some shoes on the table and will picked one up and looked at it well er she s a fine girl of course i said uncomfort ably but but will she s twenty six and you re only eighteen i know will said but i ve got to marry her oh no i said you mean she s that s right said will in about six months time i m going to be a father the actors come to town will married anne hathaway in november and she came to live in henley street john shakespeare was pleased that his oldest son was married but i don t think will s mother wanted him to marry so young families cost a lot of money and john shakespeare was having a lot of money troubles in those days times were hard in henley street susanna was born the next may all babies look the same to me but will was very pleased with her look toby she s got my eyes he said happily she s going to be as beautiful as the queen of egypt and as clever as king solomon oh yes i said all parents talk like that about their children i don t believe a word of it i didn t see much of will s wife i knew she didn t like me to her i was one of will s wild friends who got him into trouble she came from a very serious puritan family lots of church going and no singing or dancing soon there was another baby on the way and one evening in february i hurried round to henley street to hear the news will s sister joan opened the door and then will came running down the stairs it s two of them he said twins a girl and a boy isn t that wonderful will had some good friends hamnet and judith sadler and he called the twins after them john shakespeare was very pleased to have his first grandson and everyone was happy for a while will and i still went around together when we could he was still reading and writing and soon i could see a change in him he was twenty three now and he was not happy with his life stratford s too small toby he said too slow too quiet too boring i ve got to get away yes but how i asked you ve got a family three young children remember he didn t answer in the summer months companies of players often came to small towns and in five different companies came will and i always went to see the plays will loved to talk to the actors and to listen to all their stories of london the queen s men came to stratford in june and we went to see the play i don t remember what it was i know that i laughed a lot and that will said it was a stupid play with not a word of poetry in it why don t you write a play yourself i told him write a play he laughed anne would never speak to me again i didn t say anything and will looked at me and laughed again it happened a few months later i walked into the shakespeares kitchen one evening and there was anne with a red angry face shouting at the top of her voice how can you do this to me and what about the children then she saw me and stopped will was sitting at the table and looked pleased to see me i ve told anne he said quietly that i m going to live in london i want to be an actor and to write plays if i can plays screamed anne acting actors are dirty wicked people they re all thieves and criminals they drink all day and they never go to church don t be stupid anne you know that s not true listen i ll come home when i can but i must go to london i can t do anything in stratford he looked at me across the room are you coming with me toby how soon can we start i said a new life in london it s two days journey to london by horse and will talked all the way his eyes were bright and excited he was full of plans and poems and a love of life i talked to one of the queen s men he told me he said that he could find me work in the theatre acting perhaps or helping to write some plays i showed him some of my writing and he was very interested when we rode into london i began to feel afraid this was a big big city and we were just two unimportant young men from a small town i ll never forget the noise and the smells and the crowds there were people living in the city of london i never saw so many people before in my life we went down to the river thames and saw the famous london bridge with all its shops and houses down the river was the tower of london enemies of the queen went into the tower through the river gate and mostly came out without their heads we found a small inn in eastcheap not too expensive and had some bread meat and beer for our supper well we re here will said at last mmm i said what do we do next he laughed everything the next day we began to look for work those early years were wonderful we didn t have much money of course and we had to work very hard a new actor only got six shillings a week and there wasn t work every week i decided not to be an actor why not said will it s a great life we were working that month for the queen s men at the theatre called the curtain up in shoreditch will was acting four small parts in two different plays he played a soldier and a murderer in one play and in the other play he was a thief and also an italian lord in love with the queen of the night and he loved it i m not clever like you i said i can t remember all those words i forget who i am i say the soldier s words when i m an italian lord i come on stage too late or too soon i stand in all the wrong places will laughed what are you going to do then costumes i said and properties i had a talk with john heminges and he said they need a new man to help with all the clothes and the other things yes will said slowly you ll be good at that now i ve got a fight on stage tomorrow and i have to die with lots of blood how are you going to get me some blood i ve already got it i smiled kindly at him sheep s blood i got it down at smithfield market this morning you can have as much blood as you want i m keeping it warm for you will was good at acting not the best but good an actor had to do everything he had to learn his words of course perhaps for six different plays at the same time no theatre put on the same play every day he had to dance and sing and play music he had to jump and fall and fight and the fights had to look real the playgoers of london knew a real fight when they saw one john heminges of the queen s men taught us both a lot he was a good friend then and for many years i had a lot to learn too i learnt how to make shoes out of brown paper how to clean the actors hats with a bit of bread then they looked like new again i ran all over london to buy the best hair for the wigs i learnt how to make fish and fruit and a piece of meat out of wood and coloured paper will was busy day and night i don t know when he slept he was acting in plays he was writing his own plays he was reading books he was meeting other writers making friends he was learning learning learning one day we were having a glass of beer with richard burbage at the boar s head in eastcheap burbage was an actor with lord strange s men he was very friendly with will you ve written four plays now will he said they re good and you re getting better all the time and i m getting better as an actor all the time come and work with lord strange s men at the rose theatre on bankside you can write for us so we both went to the rose john heminges came with us and augustine phillips he was a good actor too we worked harder than ever at the rose plays were always in the afternoon because of the daylight we had rehearsals in the morning and by lunch time people were already coming across the river to get their places for the play and more and more people came by london was hearing the name william shakespeare again and again the plague years will wrote his play richard for richard burbage and it was a great success richard the third was a wicked king a murderer but he was wonderful on the stage with burbage s great voice and fine acting soon all london was saying king richard s famous words when his horse is killed in war a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse all kinds of people came to see plays and will was making a lot of new friends one day after the play he was talking to a young man outside the rose he was a very beautiful young man a bit like a girl perhaps but still very good looking later i asked will who he was the earl of southampton will said he s only eighteen but he loves poetry and plays isn t he a friend of the earl of essex i asked everybody knew the earl of essex he was young and good looking and some people said that queen elizabeth was in love with him i don t know about that the queen was fifty nine years old and a very very clever woman but it was true that she liked to have good looking young men around her and the earl of essex was her favourite then it all changed later of course yes he is said will but i think essex is a dangerous man henry needs better friends than him henry eh i said surprised my word do you really call him henry not lord suthampton only when other people aren t there will laughed i m still just an actor from stratford toby not very important let s go and have a drink at the boar s head on our way home will was always like that quiet never shouting about himself to the world in the boar s head we met some friends and started talking the talk was all about the plague which was coming back again into london have you heard the latest news said one man they say that more than thirty people are dying every week now and the city council said another man wants to close all the theatres they always do that when the plague comes to london there ll be no work for any of us actors but the players can go on tour surely said will yes said the first man but it s a hard life a different town a different inn a different play every night i think i ll stay in london the plague is terrible in any place but it was worst in london in those narrow streets with houses so close together and the dirty water running down the middle of the street there was no escape when the plague came it ran like fire through the town if someone in a house got the plague then the doors were shut and locked and a big red cross was put on the door nobody could leave the house you had to stay inside and fight or die if you were rich you left london as fast as you could in september the city council closed the theatres are we going on tour will i said to him one day or back to stratford we can t stay in london you go back to stratford toby he said slowly i m going to lord southampton s home in hampshire for a while he s asked me to go and stay with him i can do some writing there read his books meet a few people i looked at him there s a woman in this somewhere isn t there you ve had a strange look in your eyes for weeks will laughed but didn t answer my question the theatres in london didn t open again until june will often visited lord southampton but sometimes we went on tour with the company or spent time at home in stratford will began to spend more time in stratford because it was quiet there and he could do his writing i never heard what anne thought about it all during those years will wrote a lot of poetry he wrote his beautiful long poem venus and adonis for his friend lord southampton and he wrote many of his famous short poems the sonnets but they didn t go in a book they were only for his friends to read one day when we were back in london i was reading some of his latest sonnets will was out somewhere and i was at home in our lodgings in bishopsgate a lot of the poems were about a woman a terrible black haired black eyed woman she was cold and cruel then she was true and loving and then she was cruel again for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night was will writing about himself here i asked myself and who was this woman this dark lady i always like to know what s going on so i listened and watched and looked at all his women friends then one day i saw her i was coming in the door at our lodgings and she was coming downstairs she had black hair and great stormy black eyes and there was gold at her ears and round her neck i stood back and she went past me like a ship sailing into war she looked wild and angry and very very beautiful whew i said to myself if that s will s dark lady he ll never have a quiet easy life the woman looked italian so i went and asked john florio about her florio was lord southampton s italian teacher we saw a lot of him in those days i described the woman and he knew her at once emilia he said emilia bassano now emilia lanier wife to alphonso lanier before that she lived with the old lord chamberlain she was not his wife you understand but why do you want to know my friend if she s a married lady she doesn t have a lover now then florio laughed loudly lovers you don t know emilia lanier she s a bad woman my friend a bad woman now he spoke very quietly for a time she was the friend of lord southampton but not now that is all finished i didn t ask him about will perhaps emilia lanier was will s dark lady or perhaps will was just trying to help his friend lord southampton nobody will ever know now death in the family after the plague years we were busy all the time there were new companies of players and will now belonged to the lord chamberlain s men the lord chamberlain was a very important man close to the queen and we often put on plays for the queen s court and in the houses of the great lords of england we had some very good actors there was will and richard burbage of course and john heminges and there was augustine phillips henry condell and thomas pope there were other actors too but those six were the real company they worked together for more than twenty years and made a lot of money too i did the costumes and properties for the chamberlain s john heminges said i was the best properties man in the city will was special because he wrote the plays and what plays they were he never wrote the same play twice like some writers he was always trying something new something different and he wrote fast too john heminges could never understand that how can you write so fast will he asked him and you never make a mistake or change a word will didn t really understand it himself it s all in my head he said i think about it and then it just comes out on paper he wrote a play about love in young love it was romeo and juliet it was a very sad play because the young lovers die at the end but the playgoers loved it they wanted to see it again and again will played the part of old capulet juliet s father one of the boy actors played the part of juliet there were no women actors so boys played all the women s parts of course will never put real love making on stage he did it all with words clever beautiful words and you forgot that the women and girls were really boys in dresses some of the boy actors were very good and went on to play men s parts when they were older we played romeo and juliet at richmond palace that year we always played before the queen at christmas she liked to see the new plays and she paid us a play we often had to work through the night to get the stage ready in time but it was exciting to be in one of the queen s palaces at christmas there was a lot of singing and dancing and eating and drinking some years christmas began in november and didn t finish until february or march the year began well but that summer the weather was really bad cold wet it never stopped raining and the plague began to come back into london we were in stratford for the summer but i went down to hampshire for a few weeks to do some business for will about some sheep will didn t need me at home because he was busy writing his new play a midsummer night s dream i came back to stratford one wet august evening the house in henley street was strangely quiet and i went round the back and up to will s room his writing room we called it he was just sitting there not doing anything just sitting what s the matter will i said where is everybody at church his face was grey and his eyes looked empty dead what s happened i asked what is it he looked at me hamnet he began hamnet was ill last week and and he died yesterday he was only eleven toby and he s dead my boy my only son he s dead toby dead he put his face in his hands what can you say to a man when something like that happens to him i sat down next to him and put my hand on his arm we sat together silently i knew that will loved that boy of his red haired bright as a new penny full of life just like his father after a while i said you ll have other sons anne s forty already will s voice was tired she s had no children since the twins well now you ve got two fine girls in susanna and judith they ll marry before long and then you ll have more grandsons than you can count you ll see there ll be boys running up and down stairs shouting for their granddad will he smiled sadly but his eyes were not so empty now pleased i went on quickly and there are all your brothers gilbert richard edmund they ll have sons too the shakespeare family will never die out think of the family will the family and he did he was already a famous poet and playwright but he was a family man too the next year he bought a new house for his family it was a big grand house called new place right in the middle of stratford it cost a lot of money and the townspeople began to say mr shakespeare not young will the actor or john shakespeare s boy they were happy to do business with him and to borrow money from him anne was very pleased with the new house the wife of mr shakespeare of new place was an important person in stratford but she still didn t like will s work actors are wild dangerous people she often said to him i m not interested in plays or the theatre and i don t want to know anything about your work but she liked the money and the new house and the new dresses and the six fields of apple trees and the big farm north of stratford that came a few years later will never talked much about hamnet life goes on and will was busier than ever but i know he thought about his son a lot his grief was very deep inside him a year or two later i was talking to john heminges abut the costumes for will s new play king john john heminges was a family man he had fourteen children in the end the noise is his house shouting and laughing coming and going john was looking at the playbook you see this bit here toby he said will s writing about his son isn t he i read the words slowly and remembered will s empty eyes that day in august grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words richard burbage said once that will s writing changed after hamnet s death will still laughed at people in his plays but he also felt sorry for them sorry for all the world good and bad rich and poor young and old and his people were real no one was all good or all bad there was a man called shylock in his play the merchant of venice this shylock was a money lender and a cruel man everyone hated him but in the end when shylock lost everything you had to feel sorry for him he was just a sad old man perhaps richard was right and if anyone understood will it was richard burbage queens kings and princes every year we took more and more plays to court at christmas in one of will s plays was henry iv a lot of the play was about the king s son and his friend sir john falstaff sir john was old fat lazy drank too much talked too much laughed too much but you had to love him he was a great favourite with the london playgoers and there were a lot of falstaff jokes going round at the time after the play the queen wanted to speak to will why what have we done wrong john heminges said to me in a very quiet voice we ll find out in a minute i said we all watched while will walked over to the queen s chair she was an old woman she wore a red wig and she had black teeth but she was still a very great queen and if the queen was not pleased she had a good strong voice an actor s voice we could hear her easily mr shakespeare she began then she smiled and suddenly you knew why all englishmen loved the queen it was like the sun coming out on a spring morning mr shakespeare you are the best playwright in england i enjoyed your play and i thought that sir john falstaff was very funny i have known many englishmen like him will you write me another play i would like to see sir john in love when will came back to us his eyes were bright but he was already thinking about it don t talk to me he said i ve got a play to write he wrote it in two weeks and we took it down to richmond palace and played it before the queen on february the th she laughed and laughed at the merry wives of windsor she didn t have much to laugh about in there was a lot of trouble in ireland and the queen sent the earl of essex with men to fight a war lord southampton will s friend went with him all london came out on to the streets to watch when essex and his men left for ireland will wrote an exciting play about war that summer and he put in a word or two about ireland that was henry v about a very famous english king who fought a war in france but essex was not henry the fifth he didn t know how to fight a war and he ran away back to england later that year the queen never spoke to him again in september we opened the globe theatre it was a grand new building near the rose will richard burbage and the others paid for it themselves it was the best playhouse in london and soon the most famous the other companies had good theatres and some good actors but we had the famous richard burbage and the best plays we put on three new plays by will in the next year and some plays by other writers one of the new playwrights was ben jonson he was a clever man and he wrote clever plays but people still liked will s plays best ben couldn t understand it he was always arguing with will about how to write plays he argued with everyone he went to prison once because he killed a man in a fight he was eight years younger than will but he and will were very good friends will s next play was hamlet prince of denmark we all met one day in the boar s head to talk about it there were six of us me and will richard burbage henry condell john heminges and augustine phillips will put his pile of papers on the table and sat down well he said you ve all read it what do you think it s very good john heminges began but it s too long it ll take about four hours in the theatre we don t have to use it all will said we can cut it down to three hours perhaps two and a half henry condell picked up one of the paper from the table look at this bit when ophelia is talking about hamlet he said hamlet sounds like the earl of essex to me were you thinking of essex when you wrote this will smiled perhaps he said and perhaps not richard will play prince hamlet yes said augustine of course will said i wrote the part for him he s our star actor i ll play the ghost of hamle s father he looked at me hamlet will wear black toby and ophelia will wear white henry finished his beer it s a good story will with good parts for us all but will the playgoers like it it moves very slowly and they like a play to be fast and exciting prince hamlet knows that his uncle claudius murdered the king his father but he doesn t do anything about it for a long time he just talks about it and in the end nearly everybody dies one way or another augustine didn t agree with that you haven t understood the play henry it is exciting very exciting the play is inside hamlet himself he wants to kill his uncle but he can t murder is wrong but he must kill him because of his father we can all understand how he feels all this time richard burbage was silent he was reading bits of the play again now he put down the paper in his hand and looked up his eyes were bright excited have any of you really listened to the language of this play this is your best play yet will the best of them all just listen to the language the poetry he stood up and his great voice filled the room to be or not to be that is the question we sat and listened silently while that wonderful voice brought the words to life will watched him smiling he knew that richard like him was in love with words to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theer s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause richard burbage was right of course the people loved the play they loved burbage as hamlet they cried for poor ophelia s death and they shouted for the murderer claudius to die i think it was will s most famous play a scottish king for england will s father died in september in his last years john shakespeare was a happy man his son was famous and the shakespeare family was important again in stratford but there weren t many children in the family will s sister joan was married and had a little boy but will s brothers didn t have any children susanna will s older daughter was now eighteen and will said to her one day we must find you a husband soon susanna but susanna shook her head oh i don t want to be married father thank you we all smiled at that because there was already a young man who was often a visitor at new place that was john hall a clever young doctor will liked him back in london the theatres were always full and actors were now important people in the city will and i were now living in very fine lodgings in silver street with the mountjoy family the globe and the lord chamberlain s men were doing very well and the older actors in the company were making money and buying houses and land but some people still thought that actors were dangerous wicked people then queen elizabeth died on the th of march at richmond i remember the day well the theatres were closed you can t have plays when a queen is dying and we were all at henry condell s house he and john heminges lived verg near our lodgings in cripplegate we were all very worried the new king of england was james the first he was already king of scotland and he had a young wife queen anne of denmark and three young children but what was he like would he be a good king and most importantly did he like plays if king james doesn t like plays said henry condell we re finished there are already a lot of puritans on the london city council and they d love to close the theatres down henry always looked at the black side of everything well he s written a lot of books himself said will perhaps he ll be interested in plays too we ll just have to wait and see we didn t have to wait long on the th of may i was underneath the stage in the globe i was trying to mend a bro ken door in the floor of the stage we used this door when a ghost came on or went off in a cloud of smoke suddenly i heard feet running across the stage i looked up through the hole and saw will and john heminges and richard burbage they were all very excited listen to this toby said will he was holding a piece of paper in his hand it s a letter from king james from today we are the king s men we re working for the king himself and he wants to see all the plays we re going to have new red coats to wear when we go to court richard said and john said he s going to pay us for every play at court what do you think about that toby we were all laughing and smiling now well john i said if we re so rich can i have a new door i can t mend this one again it s too old that summer the plague came back by july a thousand people were dying every week in london one of them was the little son of will s friend ben jonson by the end of the year there were dead in england the theatres closed and the king s men went on tour will and i spent the summer at stratford when christmas came the king s men put on a lot of plays at court the king was at hampton court palace that year which was outside london well away from the plague i couldn t go because i fell off my horse one day and broke my leg stupid thing to do i had to stay at home but will told me all about it when he came back the new king and queen like to enjoy themselves toby he said they re a happy family prince henry who s nine is very a nice little boy and his sister elizabeth is beautiful little prince charles is only two he was silent for a minute perhaps he was thinking about hamnet then he went on qieen anne likes plays very much she likes music and dancing too she showed her legs in one dance my word i said things like that never happened at court in queen elizabeth s days we live in different times toby a lot of things are going to change but change only comes slowly the king s men went from one success to another at the king s court at christmas there were twenty two plays and eight of them were will s in there were thirteen plays at court and ten of them were will s we always did the plays at the globe first before we took them to court will was writing more slowly now but during these years he wrote some of his best plays othello macbeth and king lear that was a sad dark play when king lear carried his dead daughter cordelia on to the stage well every man woman and child in the globe was crying it s true richard burbage played lear of course what an actor he was the mermaid tavern during the next few years the plague was always with us some years it was bad other years not so bad when the theatres in london closed we went on tour well the king s men did will and i were mostly at home in stratford in the summers will was usually writing and i did bits of business for him when i could susanna married dr john hall in june and will s granddaughter elizabeth was born in february the next year we had a very cold winter that year the river thames in london froze right up to westminster people had parties and cooked sheep over fires on the ice will s brother edmund died that winter he was only twenty seven and will s mother died in september the next year will was writing a different kind of play at this time john heminges said they were dark cruel plays and that will was only looking at the black side of people but that was the thing about will he was still changing trying new kinds of poetry and stories in his plays all the time and suddenly there was a new kind of play full of laughing and spring flowers and love the winter s tale when we were in london we often went in the evenings to the mermaid tavern in cheapside it was a very good inn with good beer and all the writers and poets in london went there we were there one evening in the winter of i think it was a lot of will s friends were there actors writers ben jonson was there of course he was a great drinker all his life he was writing a lot of plays now and was doing very well but he never had any money will always paid for the beer at first the talk was all about king james and his court we didn t like the king so much now he was more interest ed in horses than in plays then ben remembered something about the winter s tale he knew really that will s plays were the best but he always liked to find mistakes if he could now why did you put bohemia by the sea will he said bohemia s in the middle of europe there s no sea for a hundred miles you stupid man your plays are very clever ben richard burbage said but they smell of the schoolbook don t they will will laughed how many people are going to worry about that ben what does it matter they liked the play at court the queen said it was a very sweet play and the king the king ben said loudly his face was red and angry king james sometimes fell asleep during ben s plays the king he went on excitedly is a very stupid man i told him i said it to his face sir you don t understand poetry john heminges laughed oh my word he said what a terrible man you are ben i don t know how you ve lived so long will laughed too but he said ben you must be careful you don t want the king to be your enemy don t forget that he pays twice as much as queen elizabeth did and sees twice as many plays money shouted bed he loved to argue about anything we re poets and actors not businessmen what does money matter it puts bread and meat in your stomach and a coat on your back said will drinking his beer and you re the first to shout if you haven t got any money ben banged his beer glass on the table now listen mr william shakespeare of stratford with your fine big house and your expensive horses you wrote in your play king lear that money was oh do stop it you two john heminges said he turned to talk to me but a few minutes later ben was arguing about another of will s plays and what about antony and cleopatra what kind of writing is that you never know which place you re in one minute you re in egypt the next minute you re in rome then you re at sea on a ship then back in egypt again richard burbage didn t like that you re wrong again ben it s only you who can t follow the play you think londoners are stupid but they understand more than you do and another thing i decided to go home to bed ben s a fine man but he does talk so much he goes on and on when i left he was calling for more beer i knew they would be there in the mermaid for most of the night back to stratford you re losing your hair will i said to him one day we re both getting old toby he said there s no escape from it old and tired don t talk like that i said you re only forty seven there s still some life in you yet and another twenty plays no he said slowly no i think the poetry is nearly finished i m getting tired toby i need a rest i think the tempest is going to be my last play i m saying goodbye to the stage times are changing and people want a different kind of play now there are lots of new younger writers who know how to please the playgoer i m not modern any more he never usually talked like this and i didn t like it there s only one will shakespeare i said and he ll always be modern now i must get on i ve got to go out and buy all the cloth for the new costumes in the tempest why did you have to put it on an island when the ship goes down the actors all have to come on stage in wet clothes it takes a day to dry the costumes so that means two lots of clothes for everyone wet and dry that brought him back to life can t you read he said crossly if you look at gonzalo s words in act toby you ll see that it s a magic island and their clothes stay dry all the time so they ll only need one lot i laughed and then he laughed too but it was true he was tried i could see it and others could see it too but the company was always wanting new plays and we had two theatres now there was the globe and now we had the blackfriars theatre plays in the globe were in the open air and always had to be in daylight but the blackfriars was a building with a roof we could put on plays in the evenings and in any weather it also made more money because every playgoer had a seat and paid a shilling for it in the globe they paid a penny to stand in february will s brother gilbert died in london and just a year later his brother richard died in stratford that was in february too will was the oldest brother and he was the only one still alive we spent most of our time in stratford these days will didn t act in plays now he went to rehearsals for his new plays of course but he was always happy to hurry home again we were riding back to stratford in the spring of and stopped for the night at the crown inn in oxford will was very friendly with the landlord john davenant and his wife jane the next morning when we left their little son william came running out to say goodbye to his good friend mr shakespeare he was a bright boy about seven years old with much the same colour hair and eyes as will will talked with him for a few minutes then gave him a penny later when we were riding along the road i said the last time we were in oxford i heard some talk in the town someone said that you were the father of jane davenant s son will laughed well well he said people say that do they what will they say next jane s a nice looking woman i looked at him out of the corner of my eye isn t she come on toby you know that jane is a good wife to john he was still smiling you mustn t listen to stories like that i never believed that story myself but many years after will died william davenant told a lot of people that he was shakespeare s son but how did he know his mother wouldn t tell him will was happy to get home to see his daughters and john hall and little elizabeth who was just five then he was happy to see anne i think he never said much to her nor she to him but after more than thirty years together you ve already said everything haven t you i think judith was will s favourite daughter susanna was brighter and cleverer but judith was hamnet s twin and will still remembered his son he wanted a son or a grandson so much judith was twenty eight now and still no husband but will told her not to hurry she must find the right man first will worked hard all his life and i think it was all for his family i remember some lines from his play the tempest when prospero is talking to his daughter miranda i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter the last years will did write another play of course that was henry viii and he wrote it because the king s daughter princess elizabeth was getting married the king s men had to have a new play for a special day like that we were in london for rehearsals at the globe and the actors put on the new play for the first time on the th of june i remember the date well it happened soon after the play began richard burbage was on stage and he suddenly looked up and stopped in the middle of a word fire he shouted the theatre s on fire wooden buildings burn fast and henry condell shouted everybody out quickly the crowd of playgoers began to hurry to the doors and i ran round to open them we could all see the smoke now and john heminges shouted to will the playbooks we must get the playbooks out everybody got out and no one was hurt one man s coat caught fire and his friend put the fire out with a bottle of beer but the globe burnt right down to the ground in an hour poor old john heminges just stood there and cried but you can t kill a theatre that easily a year later there was a new blobe in the same place bigger and better than the old one people said it was the finest playhouse in england we didn t often go to london in those last years will was happy at home in stratford with his family he had time for his garden time to talk to his stratford friends time to play with his granddaughter elizabeth he read his plays again and he and i talked and laughed about the old days judith got married at last in february she was thirty one then and married a man called thomas quiney who was twenty six will wasn t too happy about it judith loves him very much he said quietly to me but i m not sure about him i think she s making a mistake he was right of course will was usually right about people thomas quiney was lazy drank too much and went with other women but will didn t live to find that out in march he went to london for a party at the mermaid tavern ben jonson was now the play wright for the court of king james the king was paying him some money every year and ben wanted to give a party for his friends it was a good party i heard but will caught a fever and then rode home through the cold spring rain when he got back to new place he was not a well man he died on the rd of april in the year they put his body in holy trinity church down by the river avon it was a bright windy day i remember ben jonson came down from london and cried in the church he was a wild man was ben always fighting and arguing about plays and poetry but he loved his friend he came up to me outside the church toby he said will was a good true man and i loved him we ll never see another poet like him in england england will remember well all that was thirty three years ago i m an old man and everyone is dying around me anne shakespeare died in and john hall went about twelve years later fighting the plague susanna s still alive and judith she had three sons but they all died so there s no boy in the family to keep poor will s name alive susanna s girl elizabeth has had no children and she s forty one already susanna still comes to visit me sometimes and we talk about the old days we live in sad times now the puritans cut king charles s head off last january but one day we ll have a king again then there ll be singing and dancing and plays you ll see oh yes people won t forget william shakespeare in years time the theatres will still be full people will still laugh and cry over his plays he was the finest poet that ever wrote in the english language i think he knew that himself there s some lines in one of his sonnets i remember not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme txtba www txtba com my first sea journey before i begin my story i would like to tell you a little about myself i was born in the year in the city of york in the north of england my father was german but he came to live and work in england soon after that he married my mother who was english her family name was robinson so when i was born they called me robinson after her my father did well in his business and i went to a good school he wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet com fortable life but i didn t want that i wanted adventure and an exciting life i want to be a sailor and go to sea i told my mother and father they were very unhappy about this please don t go my father said you won t be happy you know sailors have a difficult and dangerous life and be cause i loved him and he was unhappy i tried to forget about the sea but i couldn t forget and about a year later i saw a friend in town his father had a ship and my friend said to me we re sailing to london tomorrow why don t you come with us and so on september st i went to hull and the next day we sailed for london but a few days later there was a strong wind the sea was rough and dangerous and the ship went up and down up and down i was very ill and very afraid oh i don t want to die i cried i want to live if i live i ll go home and never go to sea again the next day the wind dropped and the sea was quiet and be autiful again well bob my friend laughed how do you feel now the wind wasn t too bad what i cried it was a terrible storm oh that wasn t a storm my friend answered just a lit tle wind forget it come and have a drink after a few drinks with my friend i felt better i forgot about the danger and decided not to go home i didn t want my friends and family to laugh at me i stayed in london for some time but i still wanted to go to sea so when the captain of a ship asked me to go with him to guinea in africa i agreed and so i went to sea for the second time it was a good ship and everything went well at first but i was very ill again then when we were near the canary is lands a turkish pirate ship came after us they were famous thieves of the sea at that time there was a long hard fight but when it finished we and the ship were prisoners the turkish captain and his men took us to sallee in moroc co they wanted to sell us as slaves in the markets there but in the end the turkish captain decided to keep me for himself and took me home with him this was a sudden and terrible change in my life i was now a slave and this turkish captain was my master down the coast of africa for two long years i lived the life of a slave i worked in escape but it was never possible i thought about it day and night my master liked to go fishing in a little boat and he al ways took me with him a man called moely and a young boy also went with us one day my master said to us some of my friends want to go fishing tomorrow get the boat ready so we put a lot of food and drink on the boat and the next morning we waited for my master and his friends but when my master arrived he was alone my friends don t want to go fishing today he said to me but you go with moely and the boy and catch some fish for our supper tonight yes master i answered quietly but inside i was excited perhaps now i can escape i said to myself my master went back to his friends and we took the boat out to sea for a time we fished quietly and then i moved carefully behind moely and knocked him into the water swim i cried swim to the shore my master liked to shoot seabirds and so there were guns on the boat quickly i took one of these guns moely was swim ming after the boat and i shouted to him go back to the shore you can swim there it s not too far i won t hurt you but if you come near the boat i ll shoot you through the head so moely turned and swam back to the shore as quickly as he could then i said to the boy xury if you help me i ll be a good friend to you if you don t help me i ll push you into the sea too but xury was happy to help me i ll go all over the world with you he cried i wanted to sail to the canary islands but i was afraid to go too far from the shore it was only a small boat and so we sailed on south for some days we had very little water and it was dangerous country here with many wild animals we were afraid but we often had to go on shore to get more water once i used a gun to shoot a wild animal i don t know what animal it was but it made a good meal for about ten or twelve days we sailed on south down the coast of africa then one day we saw some people on the shore strange wild people who did not look friendly by now we had very little food and we really needed help we were afraid but we had to go on shore at first they were afraid of us too perhaps white people never visited this coast we did not speak their language of course so we used our hands and faces to show that we were hungry they came with food for us but then they moved away quickly we carried the food to our boat and they watched us i tried to thank them but i had nothing to give them just then two big wild cats came down to the shore from the mountains i think they were leopards the people were afraid of these wild cats and the women cried out quickly i took a gun and shot one of the animals the second wild cat ran back up into the mountains guns were new to these african people and they were afraid of the loud noise and the smoke but they were happy about the dead wild cat i gave them the meat of the dead animal and they gave us more food and water we now had a lot of food and water and we sailed on eleven days later we came near the cape verde islands we could see them but we couldn t get near because there was no wind we waited suddenly xury called to me look a ship he was right we called and shouted and sailed our little boat as fast as we could but the ship did not see us then i re membered the guns which made a lot of smoke a few minutes later the ship saw us and turned when we were on the ship the portuguese captain listened to my story he was going to brazil and agreed to help me but he wanted nothing for his help no he said when i tried to pay him perhaps one day someone will help me when i need it but he gave me money for my boat and for xury too at first i did not want to sell xury as a slave after all our danger ous adventures together but xury was happy to go to the cap tain and the captain was a good man in ten years time he said xury can go free when we arrived in brazil three weeks later i said goodbye to the captain and xury left the ship and went to begin a new life the storm and the shipwreck i stayed in brazil and worked hard for some years by then i was rich but also bored one day some friends came to me and said we re going to africa to do business why don t you come with us we ll all be rich after this journey how stupid i was i had an easy comfortable life in brazil but of course i agreed and so in i went to sea again at first all went well but then there was a terrible storm for twelve days the wind and the rain didn t stop we lost three men in the sea and soon the ship had holes in its sides we re all going to die this time i said to myself then one morning one of the sailors saw land but the next minute our ship hit some sand just under the sea the ship could not move and we were really in danger now the sea was trying to break the ship into pieces and we had very little time quickly we put a boat into the sea and got off the ship but the sea was very rough and our little boat could not live for long in that wild water half an hour later the angry sea turned our boat over and we were all in the water i looked round for my friends but i could see nobody i was alone that day i was lucky and the sea carried me to the shore i could not see the land only mountains of water all around me then suddenly i felt the ground under my feet another mountain of water came pushed me up the beach and i fell on the wet sand at first i was very thankful to be alive slowly i got to my feet and went higher up the shore from there i looked out to sea i could see our ship but it was wrecked and there was no body near it there was nobody in the water all my friends were dead i was alive but in a strange wild country with no food no water and no gun it was dark now and i was tired i was afraid to sleep on the shore perhaps there were wild animals there so i went up into a tree and i stayed there all night a new life on an island when day came the sea was quiet again i looked for our ship and to my surprise it was still there and still in one piece i think i can swim to it i said to myself so i walked down to the sea and before long i was at the ship and was swimming round it but how could i get on to it in the end i got in through a hole in the side but it wasn t easy there was a lot of water in the ship but the sand under the sea was still holding the ship in one place the back of the ship was high out of the water and i was very tnankful for this be cause all the ship s food was there i was very hungry so i be gan to eat something at once then i decided to take some of it back to the shore with me but how could i get it there i looked around the ship and after a few minutes i found some long pieces of wood i tied them together with rope then i got the things that i wanted from the ship there was a big box of food rice and salted meat and hard ship s bread i al so took many strong knives and other tools the ship s sails and ropes paper pens books and seven guns now i needed a little sail from the ship and then i was ready slowly and carefully i went back to the shore it was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea but in the end i got everything on to the shore now i needed somewhere to keep my things there were some hills around me so i decided to build my self a little house on one of them i walked to the top of the highest hill and looked down i was very unhappy because i saw then that i was on an island there were two smaller is lands a few miles away and after that only the sea just the sea for mile after mile after mile after a time i found a little cave in the side of a hill in front of it there was a good place to make a home so i used the ship s sails rope and pieces of wood and after a lot of hard work i had a very fine tent the cave at the back of my tent was a good place to keep my food and so i called it my kitchen that night i went to sleep in my new home the next day i thought about the possible dangers on the is land were there wild animals and perhaps wild people too on my island i didn t know but i was very afraid so i decided to build a very strong fence i cut down young trees and put them in the ground in a halfcircle around the front of my tent i used many of the ship s ropes too and in the end my fence was as strong as a stone wall nobody could get over it through it or round it making tents and building fences is hard work i needed many tools to help me so i decided to go back to the ship again and get some more things i went back twelve times but soon after my twelfth visit there was another terrible storm the next morning when i looked out to sea there was no ship when i saw that i was very unhappy why am i alive and why are all my friends dead i asked myself what will hap pen to me now alone on this island without friends how can i ever escape from it then i told myself that i was lucky lucky to be alive lucky to have food and tools lucky to be young and strong but i knew that my island was somewhere off the coast of south america ships did not often come down this coast and i said to myself i m going to be on this island for a long time so on a long piece of wood i cut these words i came here on th september after that i decided to make a cut for each day learning to live alone i still needed a lot of things well i said i m going to have to make them so every day i worked first of all i wanted to make my cave bigger i carried out stone from the cave and after many days hard work i had a large cave in the side of the hill then i needed a table and a chair and that was my next job i had to work on them for a long time i also wanted to make places to put all my food and all my tools and guns but every time i wanted a piece of wood i had to cut down a tree it was long slow difficult work and during the next months i learnt to be very clever with my tools there was no hurry i had all the time in the world i also went out every day and i always had my gun with me sometimes i killed a wild animal and then i had meat to eat but when it got dark i had to go to bed because i had no light i couldn t read or write because i couldn t see for a long time i didn t know what to do but in the end i learnt how to use the fat of dead animals to make a light the weather on my island was usually very hot and there were often storms and heavy rain the next june it rained all the time and i couldn t go out very often i was also ill for some weeks but slowly i got better when i was stronger i began to go out again the first time i killed a wild animal and the second time i caught a big turtle i was on the island for ten months before i visited other parts of it during those months i worked hard on my cave and my house and my fence now i was ready to find out more about the rest of the island first i walked along the side of a little river there i found open ground without trees later i came to more trees with many different fruits i decided to take a lot of the fruit and to put it to dry in the sun for a time then i could keep it for many months that night i went to sleep in a tree for the second time and the next day i went on with my journey soon i came to an opening in the hills in front of me everything was green and there were flowers everywhere there were also a lot of differ ent birds and animals i saw that my house was on the worst side of the island but i didn t want to move from there it was my home now i stayed away for three days and then i came home but i often went back to the other greener side of the island and so my life went on every month i learnt to do or to make something new but i had troubles and accidents too once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain the roof of my cave fell in and nearly killed me i had to build it up again with many pieces of wood i had a lot of food now i cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun so i always had meat during the rainy months when i could not go out with a gun i learnt to make pots to keep my food in but i wanted very much to make a harder stronger pot a pot that would not break in a fire i tried many times but i could not do it then one day i was lucky i made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire they changed colour but did not break i left them there for many hours and when they were cold again i found that they were hard and strong that night i was very happy i had hot water for the first time on the island by then i also had my own bread that was luck too one day i found a little bag we used it on the ship to keep the chickens food in there was still some of the food in the bag and i dropped some of it onto the ground a month later i saw something bright green there and after six months i had a very small field of corn i was very excited perhaps now i could make my own bread it was easy to say but not so easy to do it is a lot of work to make bread from corn many people eat bread but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help i had to learn and to make many new things and it was a year before i cooked and ate my first bread during all this time i never stopped thinking about escape when i travelled across to the other side of the island i could see the other islands and i said to myself perhaps i can get there with a boat perhaps i can get back to england one day so i decided to make myself a boat i cut down a big tree and then began to make a long hole in it it was hard work but about six months later i had a very fine canoe next i had to get it down to the sea how stupid i was why didn t i think before i began work of course the canoe was too heavy i couldn t move it i pulled and pushed and tried everything but it didn t move i was very unhappy for a long time after that that happened in my fourth year on the island in my sixth year i did make myself a smaller canoe but i did not try to es cape in it the boat was too small for a long journey and i did not want to die at sea the island was my home now not my prison and i was just happy to be alive a year or two later i made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island i also built myself a second house there and so i had two homes my life was still busy from morning to night there were al ways things to do or to make i learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals they looked very strange it is true but they kept me dry in the rain i kept food and tools at both my houses and also wild goats there were many goats on the island and i made fields with high fences to keep them in they learnt to take food from me and soon i had goat s milk to drink every day i also worked hard in my cornfields and so many years went by a footprint then one year something strange and terrible happened i often walked along the shore and one day i saw something in the sand i went over to look at it more care fully and stopped in sudden surprise it was a footprint the footprint of a man who could this be afraid i looked around me i listened i waited nothing i was more and more afraid perhaps this man was one of those wild people who killed and ate other men i looked everywhere but there was nobody and no other foot print i turned and hurried home there s someone on my is land i said to myself perhaps he knows about me per haps he s watching me now from behind a tree perhaps he wants to kill me that night i couldn t sleep the next day i got all my guns ready and i put more wood and young trees around my house nobody could see me now but after fifteen years alone on the island i was afraid and i did not leave my cave for three days in the end i had to go out to milk my goats but for two years i was afraid i stayed near my home and i never used my guns because i didn t want to make a noise i could not forget the footprint but i saw and heard nothing more and slowly i began to feel happier one day a year later i was over on the west side of the is land from there i could see the other islands and i could also see a boat far out to sea if you have a boat i thought it s easy to sail across to this island perhaps that explains the foot print it was a visitor from one of the other islands i began to move more freely around the island again and built myself a third house it was a very secret place in a cave no wild man will ever find that i said to myself then one year something happened which i can never forget i was again on the west side of the island and was walk ing along the shore suddenly i saw something which made me feel ill there were heads arms feet and other pieces of men s bodies everywhere for a minute i couldn t think and then i understood sometimes there were fights between the wild men on the other islands then they came here to my island with their prisoners to kill them cook them and eat them slowly i went home but i was very angry how could men do this for many months i watched carefully for the smoke from fires but i didn t see anything somehow the wild men came and went and i never saw them i was angry and afraid i wanted to shoot them all but there were many of them and on ly one of me perhaps i can shoot two or three i said to my self but then they will kill and eat me then one morning in my twenty third year on the island i was out in my fields and i saw the smoke from a fire quickly i went up the hill to watch there were nine men around the fire and they were cooking their terrible food then these wild men danced round the fire singing and shouting this went on for about two hours and then they got into their boats and sailed away i went down to the shore and saw the blood of the dead men on the sand the next time they come i m going to kill them i said angrily man friday for two years i never went anywhere without my gun i felt lonely and afraid and had many sleepless nights one night there was a very bad storm and i thought i heard the sound of guns out at sea the next morning i looked out and saw a ship it was lying on its side not far from the shore quickly i put my little boat in the water and sailed out to it there were two dead men on the ship but no one alive the bodies of the other sailors were lost in the sea i took some clothes and tools and also a box of spanish gold and silver money i was a rich man now but what use was money to me i could not buy anything with it i wanted people a friend somebody to talk to somebody who could help me escape from my island one morning i woke up and made a plan i ll try to catch one of the prisoners of the wild men i said to myself he ll be happy to be alive and perhaps he ll help me to escape i watched day and night but for a year and a half there were no boats then one day five boats came there were about thirty men and they had two prisoners they made their fire on the sand and danced round it then they killed one of the prisoners and began to cook their terrible meal the second prisoner waited under the trees with two men to watch him suddenly the prisoner turned and ran the two men ran after him but the other wild men were busy round the fire and did not see what was happening the prisoner ran like a wild goat and soon i saw that he was coming near the bottom of my hill as fast as i could i ran down the hill and jumped out of the trees between the prisoner and the two wild men i hit the first man with the wooden end of my gun and he fell down but i had to shoot the second man the poor prisoner did not move he was afraid of the noise of my gun i called to him and tried to show him that i was friendly slowly he moved nearer to me but just then the first wild man began to get up from the ground then the prisoner spoke and i understood that he wanted my sword how happy i was to hear words again i gave him my sword and at once he cut off the head of his enemy hurriedly we hid the dead bodies under some leaves and then left quickly i took my prisoner to my secret cave on the other side of the island and gave him food and drink after that he went to sleep he was a fine young man about twenty five years old tall and well built with a kind face and a nice smile he had a brown skin black hair bright eyes and strong white teeth i decided to give him the name of man friday because i first saw him on a friday when he woke up in the morning he ran out to me i was milking my goats in the field and he got down on the ground and put his head near my foot i understood that he was thank ing me and i tried to show him that i was his friend i began to teach him to speak english and soon he could say his name master and yes and no how good it was to hear a man s voice again later that day we went back to my first house we went carefully along the beach but there were no boats and no wild men just blood and bones all over the sand i felt ill but fri day wanted to eat the pieces of men s bodies which were still on the ground i showed him that this was terrible for me and he understood when we got to my house i gave man friday some trousers and i made him a coat and a hat he liked his new clothes very much then i made him a little tent to sleep in but for a few weeks i always took my gun to bed with me per haps friday was still a wild man and would try to kill me in the night at first friday was very afraid of my gun some times he talked to it and asked it not to kill him friday was a quick learner and his english got better day by day he helped me with the goats and with the work in the cornfields and soon we were good friends i enjoyed teaching him and most of all having a friend to talk to this was the happiest of all my years on the island friday and i lived together happily for three years i told him the story of my adventures and about life in england and he told me about his country and his people one day we were at the top of the highest hill on the island and we were looking out to sea it was a very clear day and we could see a long way suddenly friday began to jump up and down very excited what s the matter i said look master look friday cried i can see my country look over there i looked and there to the north west between the sea and the sky was a long thin piece of land i learnt later that it was the island of trinidad and that my island was in the mouth of the river orinoco on the north coast of south america i began to think again about escape perhaps friday wanted to go home too perhaps together we could get to his country but what then would friday still be my friend or would his people kill me and eat me i took friday to the other side of the island and showed him my big canoe it still lay under the trees it was very old now and there were holes in the wood could a boat like this sail to your country friday i asked him oh yes he answered a boat like this can carry a lot of food and drink then we ll make another canoe like it and you can go home in it i said but friday looked very unhappy why are you angry with me he asked what have i done why do you want to send me home but i thought you wanted to go home i said yes but you must come with me kill me if you want but don t send me away from you then i saw that friday was a true friend and so i agreed to go with him we began work on the canoe at once friday chose the tree himself he understood wood better than i did and we cut it down we worked hard and in a month the boat was finished two weeks later it was in the sea and we began to get ready for our long journey escape from the island i was now in my twenty seventh year on the island and i did not want to be there for another year we worked hard to get the corn in and to make a lot of bread we had dried fruit and salted meat and big pots to keep water in one evening friday went out to look for a turtle for meat and eggs but in less than an hour he was back and he looked very afraid master master he cried there s a great ship near the island and men are coming to the shore in a boat i jumped up and ran with him down to the shore to my great surprise i saw that it was an english ship but why was it here english ships never came this way perhaps they were pirates don t let them see you friday i called we ll hide in the trees and watch there were eleven men in the boat but three of them were prisoners their arms were tied with rope but their legs were free and they could walk the other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach laughing and shouting and hitting them then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink others walked away to look at the island and two men stayed to watch the boat the three prisoners walked slowly a long the beach and sat dowm under a tree not far from us they looked very unhappy very quietly i came up behind them through the trees and called out to them in english don t be afraid i said i m an englishman perhaps i can help you the three men turned and looked at me they did not an swer at once they were too surprised perhaps they thought i was a wild man myself in my strange home made clothes of animals skins and with my long hair and beard then the old est man spoke i am the captain of that ship he said and these two men are my first and second officers last night there was a mutiny and the seamen took the ship from me now they re going to leave the three of us here to die on this island de these mutineers have guns only two he answered and they ve left those on the boat all righ i said we ll fight them but if we get your ship back for you you must take me back to england the captain agreed immediately and thanked me very warm ly for my help friday ran back to my house to get all the guns and the captain and i made a plan the first part was easy because the seamen were not ready for a fight we shot the two men at the boat and the captain shot another man this man tom smith was the worst of them all and he began the mutiny on the ship then the cap tain talked to the other five men and they agreed to help him they did not really want to be mutineers but they were afraid of tom smith now i said to the captain we must get back your ship how many men are on it twenty six the captain replied and they will fight hard because they won t want to go home it is death for all muti neers in england but not all the men are bad i m sure that some of them will help me just then we saw another boat which was coming from the ship to the shore there were ten men in it and they all had guns we ran into the trees and waited it was a long hard fight but by now it was dark and this helped us very much we ran here and there in the trees call ing and shouting the seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting in the end the first officer shouted to them put down your guns and stop fightng the captain has fifty island people to help him we can kill you all so the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns three of the men agreed to come back to the captain and we put the others in my cave friday and i stayed to watch the prisoners while the captain and his men went back to fight for the ship all night we listened to the sound of guns and shouting but in the morning when the sun came up the captain was master of his ship again i went down to the shore to meet him my dear friend he cried there s your ship i ll take you to the ends of the world in it i put my arms round him and we laughed and cried together how happy i was to leave the ialand my good friend friday came with me of course but we left the mutineers on the island we decided not to kill them they could begin a new life on the island i showed them my three houses my cornfields and my goats and all my tools their life would he easy because of all my hard work for so many years and so on the nineteenth of december after twen ty seven years two months and nineteen days i said good bye to my island and sailed home to england home in england when i came back to england i felt like a stranger in the country many things were different and not many people remembered me i went home to york but my fa ther and mother were dead and also my two brothers i did find the two sons of one of my brothers they were happy to learn that i was alive and i was pleased to find some family after some months i decided to go down to lisbon in portu gal i had friends there who could help me to sell my land in brazil and i needed the money friday came with me he was always a good and true friend to me in lisbon i found the portuguese captain who took me in his ship to brazil all those years ago it was good to see him again and he helped me with my business soon i was ready to go home again by land no more adventures and dangers by sea for me it was a long hard journey we had to cross the mountains between spain and france in winter and the snow was deep poor friday was very afraid of the snow in his country it was always hot and he did not like cold weather back in england i found a house and began to live a quiet life my two nephews came to live with me the younger one wanted to be a sailor and so i found him a place on a ship af ter a while i married and had three children two sons and a daughter then my wife died and my nephew who was now the captain of a ship came home to see me he knew that i did not really like a quiet life i have a fine ship uncle he said i m going out to the east indies india malaya the philippines why don t you

namiki replied i never met them but i ll keep that ring all my life in the next few hours in that small room in geneva the jew ellery was sold for but who was wallis and who was edward and why was their love story so special let s begin at the beginning a lonely child prince edward was born in his father king george v was a tall cold man who did not like chil dren why does edward talk all the time he once said he s a very noisy child his mother queen mary agreed it doesn t matter if edward is happy or unhappy she said a child must be silent and strong the family lived in buckingham palace which had rooms there were kitchens bathrooms toilets dining rooms bedrooms and sitting rooms edward once told a story about the house buckingham palace was very big and people sometimes got lost one night my mother my father and i were sitting in the dining room we were waiting for our dinner we wait ed and waited but the food did not come after twenty minutes my father was very angry he stood up and went to the kitchen where is the cook he shouted and where is my food but sir the cook replied your dinner left the kitchen fifteen minutes ago hasn t it arrived yet no it hasn t my father shouted and i m hungry the king left the kitchen and began to look for the food ten minutes later he saw a woman who was carrying three plates of meat and potatoes what happened to you my father said why didn t you bring us our dinner i m sorry sir the woman replied there are a lot of dining rooms i couldn t remember where to go but if you return to the table sir this time i can follow you to the right room edward did not go to school with other children he stayed in buckingham palace where he had a special classroom just for him this is how edward described his lessons my teacher mr hansell was a thin man he never smiled and his nose was very red we had lots of books but they were all very boring they were full of words and they didn t have any pictures sometimes i stopped reading and looked out dow mr hansell got very angry he took a stick and hit me on the arm don t look out of the window little boy he shouted look at the book he hit me many times and my arm was red every friday the teacher took me to my father s room and what has my son learnt this week mr hansell the king asked and the answer was always not very much i m afraid sir edward doesn t like his lessons he never lis tens to what i say when mr hansell left the room my father was angry with me what s wrong with you child he said are you stupid why can t you learn anything but the lessons are so boring sir i replied and mr hansell hits me i don t understand you edward you re a baby you re so weak you ll never be a good king a king must be strong go to your room and stay there until the morning i spent many days alone in my room edward wrote later i never played with other children and i didn t have any friends i lived in the most beautiful house in england but i was always lonely and sad i saw my mother once a day at din ner time and i saw my father three or four times a week but they never gave me any love i was afraid of them and every thing i did was wrong the prince of wales in the spring of king george called edward into his room and said next month i ll make you prince of wales and these are your clothes for the ceremony the king opened a small cupboard and edward started to cry but father he said i m sixteen years old now i can t wear soft shoes and a skirt i ll look like a girl why can t i dress like other people because you re different and special his father replied and one day you ll be king edward cried for the next two days but there was noth ing he could do and so on th june the family drove to caernar von castle in north wales and the ceremony began the king put a small gold crown on edward s head there was music and dancing and the crowd began to shout the new prince of wales closed his eyes i feel terrible he said can we go home now not yet the king replied the people want to see you edward walked to the front of the castle and looked down at the crowd he was shaking and his face was red smile edward the king said you are happy a few hours later the family were driving back to windsor wasn t that a lovely day queen mary said edward took off his shoes and looked out of the window never again he thought never again the royal star after a year at oxford university edward went to fight in the first world war he wrote i lived in a house with twenty five other soldiers at night we talked about our lives and our families it was very inter esting i could speak freely to different people rich and poor young and old but i also saw the blood and noise of war one day in my driver took me to the town of loos in belgium i got out of the car and walked to the top of the hill down below me there was heavy fighting and i felt very sad an hour later i returned to my car i ll never forget what i saw my driver was dead while i was away some body shot him in the neck when the war finished in edward returned to bucking ham palace one night he was talking to his father in the din ing room i don t understand why countries fight the prince said the war has finished but nothing has changed there are still millions of poor and hungry people it s not right somebody must do something well king george replied you can t change the world if you sit by the fire you must travel meet people talk to them listen to what they say and then when you are king you can make the world a better place and so in edward left england again during the next five years he travelled kilometres and visited different countries he saw india argentina nigeria mexico new zealand germany and japan when he came to toronto in canada there were people in the streets to meet him everywhere thousands of people waited to see him there were crowds of in cape town in paris in new york and in melbourne edward is the first royal star one newspaper wrote and he is now the most famous man in the world in the old days princes were cold and bored but edward is different he gets out of his car and walks down the street every two or three minutes he stops and speaks with the crowd he laughs he smiles he shakes a thousand hands he is a man of the people with a heart of gold the meeting in the autumn of edward went to stay with his friends lord and lady furness this is how he described that weekend in a book called a king s story on saturday the weather was cold and windy it was raining heavily so we could not ride our horses we decided to stay in the house and have an early lunch with some of lady furness friends at one o clock wallis arrived with her husband she was beautifully dressed and she smiled all the time she spoke with lord furness for a few minutes and then lady fur ness brought her over to see me sir i would like you to meet one of my dearest and sweetest american friends mrs wallis simpson how do you do mrs simpson i said please come and sit down lady furness left us and we began to talk i could see that wallis was not felling very well she had a bad cold and her eyes were red i m afraid that our english houses aren t very warm i said we don t have american central heating here there was a long silence mrs simpson turned her face and looked out of the window then she said you have disappointed me sir and why is that i asked because everybody asks me about american central heat ing i thought that the prince of wales would talk about something more interesting i began to laugh what s the matter sir wallis asked have i said something wrong no i replied i m laughing because you didn t lie to me you told me the truth but why is that funny doesn t everybody do that one day i ll be king of england i replied and people are afraid of me if i say that the sky is yellow they say yes sir you are right if i say that wednesday is the first day of the week they say yes sir you are right and if i say that scotland is bigger than canada they say yes sir you are right but you told me that i was boring you told me the truth i like that there was another silence and then wallis began to laugh can i say one more thing sir yes mrs simpson what is it it s your trousers sir my trousers yes sir they are black and your shoes are brown these two colours don t look right together i stood up and looked in the mirror yes mrs simp son you re right i look very strange the next time we meet i will be better dressed when lunch was ready we walked through into the dining room i sat at one end of the table and wallis sat at the other end i was watching her very carefully i thought how beautiful her hands were she began talking to lady furness and then a few minutes later she turned and smiled at me i felt very happy after lunch wallis came over to say goodbye my hus band and i have to leave now sir we re going to another party in london i wanted to speak to her but i could not find the right words i don t know why we shook hands and wallis walked away i went into the next room and sat down near lady fur ness tell me about mrs simpson i said what would you like to know she asked everything i said then perhaps sir you would like to walk in the gar den we can talk more freely there we stood up and left the house by the back door we walked slowly through the trees and lady furness told me about wallis wallis this is how lady furness described mrs simpson s early life to edward wallis was born in baltimore she never knew her father he died when she was five months old but her mother was a strong and loving woman and wallis was a happy child when she was twenty she married a man called win field spencer for the first few years they were happy togeth er but one day winfield lost some money in the street he was very angry when he came home he took a bottle of whisky from a cupbodrd and began to drink that night he hit wallis in the mouth she screamed and he hit her again there was blood on her face and she was shaking like a leaf please winfield she said no more but winfield took her arm and pulled her up the stairs you re my prisoner he shouted at her and you re not going to leave then he pushed her into the bathroom and locked the door the next morning wallis went back to her family i can t stay with him she said i want a divorce poor wallis edward said but what happened next lady furness well said lady furness a few months later she met a fine man called ernest simpson he s quiet but interesting they got married and they now live in a beautiful flat in the centre of london and are they happy asked edward lady furness looked at the prince and smiled i don t know sir she said i don t know during the next two years the prince saw wallis once or twice a week they had the same friends and they often met at parties mrs simpson knew a lot about life edward once said she loved books food people and travel she was very beautiful and her eyes were full of fire she was friendly and easy to talk to and after a while i opened up my heart we had no secrets i told her everything and that s how it all began his eyes were always sad wallis said about edward and sometimes he looked like a childso young so quiet so weak he had no real friends perhaps people were a little afraid of him but he was a warm and kind man when he talked to me i felt my heart jump i wanted to be alone with him but i knew that wasn t possible did the prince love me in those early days no i don t think so but each time we met we just felt closer and closer in june edward gave a birthday party for wallis and during the next few months he visited the simpson s flat in london almost every day one evening the prince asked wallis and ernest to go skiing in austria i m sorry sir mr simpson replied i have to go to america on business but perhaps wallis and her aunt can come with you we went to kitzb hl as friends wallis wrote later but when we came home we were in love and a few months later the prince asked me to marry him it was just like a dream the king is dead long live the king in january edward went to windsor for a few weeks he was tired of town life and he wanted to work in his garden and ride his horses but then one afternoon there was a phone call from queen mary edward she said you must come back im mediately your father is very ill and i think he s going to die when edward arrived he went straight to his father s room he walked to the side of the bed and kissed his father s white face the king opened his eyes and smiled then he took his son s hand and said be a good king edward and be good to your mother yes father i will the king closed his eyes and did not speak again just af ter midnight he died then queen mary took edward s hand and kissed it my child you are now king she said softly god be with you his three brothers came to him one by one and they each kissed his hand the king is dead long live the king they said at one o clock edward left the room to telephone wallis my father is dead he said i m so sorry sir i must stay here for a while edward went on but i ll phone you at the weekend nothing will change between you and me i love you more than ever and you will be my queen let s not talk about that now wallis replied you must go back to your family but you are my family wallis you are everything to me goodnight sleep well when wallis

came down to breakfast gordon lang the archbishop of canterbury was waiting for him good morning gordon the king said how nice to see you again and what can i do for you for a minute the archbishop said nothing then he opened a small black bag and took out three newspapers i have come to see you about mrs wallis simpsonn he began the newspapers say that you want to marry her are these stories true sir yes gordon wallis is going to be my wife but that s not possible the archbishop replied you know what the church thinks about marriage and divorce di vorce is wrong in the eyes of god edward

the floor and shook his head you re making a big mistake sir he said the church is very strong and we will not have this woman as our queen suddenly edward stood up his face red and angry thank you for coming he said but i have nothing more to say and i want to be alone the archbishop stood up to go but then turned and touched the king s arm please sir think again the church will be against you i don t care edward replied i have god on my side and that is all i need goodbye mr lang the storm in july and august wallis and the king sailed the mediter ranean they met prime minister metaxas in greece kemal ataturk in turkey and king boris in bulgaria but that summer is famous for edward s clothes on the journey from athens to istanbul the king took off his shirt to get brown in the sun it was hot and ten minutes later he was asleep so he did not see the young photographer who was now taking pictures of the king when edward returned from the mediterranean there was a letter waiting for him it was from mr albert thompson of birmingham who wrote i saw a picture of you in the newspaper this morning and i felt very angry i have never seen a king dressed as bad ly as you were no shirt and no tie no socks no hat and in short trousers how could you sir edward showed this letter to stanley baldwin the prime minister what do you think of this the king asked mr thompson is right sir the prime minister replied you want to be modern but the people don t like it edward put the letter on the fire and do you think that divorce is modern mr baldwin the prime minister sat down yes sir he began i ve read about this mrs simpson she has two husbands still alive and you must understand what that means sir she cannot marry a king but i cannot live without her edward said then sir the prime minister replied i can see there s a storm coming i have talked to your family and to archbishop lang and we will not have this woman as our queen that night the prime minister and the king spoke for

can do i will give the crown to my brother and leave england i must follow my heart you tell me that it s a crime to fall in love you tell me that it s wrong to be happy how strange this country is an

winston he said you were a good friend to me thank you sir and you were a good king at ten o clock the next morning the telephone rang in edward s bedroom they re ready for you now sir a voice said the king walked slowly down the stairs in front of him there was an open door the family were waiting for him his mother sat near the window dressed in black his brothers stood beside her how close they are the king thought on a small table in the centre of the room there was a piece of paper edward sat down and read these words i edward the eighth king of great britain king of india king of

god be with you long live king george edward left windsor castle and got into a large black car it was now midnight and it was just beginning to rain take me away as quickly as you can he said the car moved off into the darkness and the rain what a night said the driver i think the sky is cry ing sir at a m they arrived at portsmouth edward got out of the car and a voice said the king is here edward stopped and looked out across the open sea there was a thin cold smile on his face king he said no i am not the king i am just a man in love then he turned and walked onto the ship and into the night bbc the wedding the next morning edward telephoned wallis from boulogne did you listen to me on the radio he asked yes of course she said and how did you feel i was sitting in my room alone wallis said and when i listened to your words i felt so sad i put my hands over my eyes and i just cried i couldn t stop myself you have left everything for me but i love you so much edward and with me you ll be the happiest man in the world i am that already he replied you are all that matters in my life edward married wallis simpson six months later on rd june none of the royal family came to the wedding edward was forty three wallis was forty one and they now took a new name the duke and duchess of windsor a few weeks later edward wrote to his brother king george i was surprised that you didn t come to the wedding he wrote but wallis is now my wife and nothing can change that as you know we have a house in paris but france is not my home and i want to live again at windsor with wallis by my side i m sorry edward king george wrote back but you know how i feel about that woman i do not like her i will never like her you can live here but wallis cannot my brother edward said later pushed me away like a dog i will never forget what he did and after that i decided that i didn t want my family they didn t want wallis and so i didn t want them paris for the next thirty years the duke and duchess lived in paris they gave parties and travelled round the world but they never went back to buckingham palace when king george died in and queen mary died in edward returned to windsor for a few days but wallis stayed in france it s your family she said not mine but then in the duke and duchess met queen elizabeth the daughter of king george at a small party in london after thirty long years it was time to forget the past elizabeth kissed the duchess and touched her arm then she turned to the duke and said wallis is so beautiful uncle i think you re a lucky man that day elizabeth was very kind to us edward wrote later but why couldn t my mother or my brother say those words to me on bbc television in the duke and duchess spoke about their life together do you argue someone asked them no not really the duchess replied but there s one thing about my husband that i really don t like he is always late it doesn t matter if he s meeting a queen a president or a film star he can never arrive on time i don t know why i have tried to change him but it s just not possible the duke smiled and touched her hand i know that i m often late he said but on our wedding day i arrived at the church twenty minutes before you i was early and you were late yes that s true the duchess said and they both laughed you could see real love in their eyes one newspaper wrote they were on television but they forgot about the cameras and the millions of people who were watching they were just two people in love the duchess was famous for her jewellery after my husband she once said i love jewellery more than anything else in the world and after thirty five years with the duke she had hundreds of pieces which came from all over the world i have never met a more beautiful woman than wallis edward wrote and i love giving her presents she has given me so much happiness i buy her jewels to say thank you in may the duke became ill when the doctor arrived he listened to edward s heart and then said how many cigarettes do you have a day sir about forty or fifty the duke replied but please don t ask me to stop i ve smoked for sixty years and i cannot change now that night edward called wallis into the room i feel very tired he said and i m afraid i love you i have been very happy with you and you have been a wonderful wife when i die i want you to take my body back to windsor will you do that for me yes of course she said and they both began to cry the duke of windsor died one hour later with wallis by his side three days later a blue aeroplane arrived in paris wallis went back to england with the duke s body and for the first time in her life she entered buckingham palace a week later the duchess returned to france and for the next fourteen years she lived alone in paris the big house was dark the doors were locked and she did not go out in the afternoons she sat in the dining room with edward s love letters they were so beautiful she said i read them again and again but then in wallis became ill she went to a small hospital near the house and a few days later she died with out edward she once wrote my life was empty she was buried in england next to her husband at wind sor it s a strange thing one newspaper wrote when they were alive the duke and duchess could never live in britain it was only in death that they could be there together bbc long live love in two years before his death edward said there are some people who think that i was wrong to give away my crown but they don t understand true love when i was young i lived in buckingham palace i could have anything that i wanted but i wasn t happy be cause my heart was empty then i met wallis and everything changed for half of my life i have lived here with the most beautiful woman in the world and she is everything to me when i sit in my garden with the duchess by my side i sometimes think about my early life i remember the days alone in my bedroom i remember the teacher who hit me with a stick i remember the war and my travels around the world and then i remember the crowds of people below my window who shouted long live love on my last night in london i spoke with winston churchill in the middle of our conversation he said i think sir that the best things in life are free i have nev er forgotten those words and now many years later i un derstand what they mean you cannot buy happiness and you cannot buy love to be happy deep inside your heart is the most wonderful thing in the world i have been a lucky man and so i say thank god for wallis and long live love a surprise for the cuthberts matthew cuthbert lived with his sister marilla on their farm on prince edward island in canada their farmhouse green gables was just outside the little village of avonlea matthew was nearly sixty and had a long brown beard his sister was five years younger they were both tall and thin with dark hair everybody in avonlea knew that the cuthberts were quiet people who worked very hard on their farm one afternoon matthew drove the horse and cart to the sta tion has the five thirty train arrived yet he asked the sta tion master yes the man replied and there s a passenger who s waiting for you a little girl a little girl asked matthew but i ve come for a boy the children s home is sending us one of their orphan boys we re going to adopt him you see and he s going to help me with the farm work well perhaps the children s home didn t have any boys so they sent you a girl answered the stationmaster carelessly here she is matthew turned shyly to speak to the child she was about eleven with long red hair in two plaits her face was small white and thin with a lot of freckles and she had large grey green eyes she was wearing an old brown hat and a dress which was too small for her are you mr cuthbert of green gables she asked excitedly in a high sweet voice i m very happy to come and live with you and belong to you i ve never belonged to anyone you see the people at the children s home were very kind but it s not very exciting to live in a place like that is it matthew felt sorry for the child how could he tell her that it was all a mistake but he couldn t just leave her at the sta tion he decided to take her home with him marilla could ex plain the mistake to her he was surprised that he enjoyed the journey home he was a quiet shy man and he didn t like talking himself but to day he only had to listen because the little girl talked and talked and talked she told him all about herself while they drove along my parents died when i was a baby you know and for the last three years i ve had to work for my food i ve lived with three different families and looked after their children so i ve always been poor and i haven t got any nice dresses but i just imagine that i m wearing the most beautiful blue dress and a big hat with flowers on and blue shoes and then i m happy do you imagine things sometimes well i i not often said matthew they were now driving past some very old apple trees next to the road the trees were full of sweet smelling snowywhite flowers the little girl looked at them aren t the trees beautiful she said happily but am i talking too much please tell me i can stop if necessary you know matthew smiled at her you go on talking he answered i like listening to you when they arrived at green gables marilla came to the door to meet them but when she saw the little girl she cried in surprise matthew who s that where s the boy the children s home has made a mistake he said unhappily and sent a girl not a boy the child was listening carefully suddenly she put her head in her hands and began to cry you you don t want me she sobbed oh oh you don t want me because i m not a boy now now don t cry said marilla kindly don t you understand oh this is the worst thing that s happened to me in all my life well you can stay here just for tonight said marilla now what s your name the child stopped crying will you please call me cordelia she asked call you cordelia is that your name well no it isn t but it s a very beautiful name isn t it i like to imagine my name is cordelia because my real name is anne shirley and that s not a very interesting name is it marilla shook her head the child has too much imagina tion she thought later when anne was in bed marilla said to her brother she must go back to the children s home tomorrow marilla don t you think began matthew she s a nice little thing you know matthew cuthbert are you telling me that you want to keep her asked marilla crossly matthew looked uncomfortable well she s clever and interesting and but we don t need a girl but perhaps she needs us matthew replied surprisingly quickly for him she s had a very unhappy life up to now marilla she can help you in the house i can get a boy from the village to help me on the farm what do you think marilla thought for a long time all right she said in the end i agree the poor child can stay i ll look after her matthew smiled happily be as good and kind to her as you can marilla i think she needs a lot of love at green gables and so the next morning marilla said well anne matthew and i have decided to keep you only if you re a good girl of course why child what s the matter i m crying sobbed anne because i m very happy it s beautiful here people say i m very bad but i ll try very hard to be good oh thank you thank you now stop crying child said marilla a little crossly and listen we re going to adopt you and send you to school after the summer holidays anne stopped crying can i call you aunt marilla i ve never had any family at all so i d really like to have an aunt we could imagine that you re my mother s sister i couldn t answered marilla firmly don t you imagine things asked anne surprised no i don t marilla replied i do my housework and look after matthew and go to church on sunday there s no time for imagining things in this house just remember that anne anne was silent for a few minutes then she said marillam do you think i ll find a best friend in avonlea someone who really understands me and knows all my secrets i ve always wanted a friend like that our friends the barrys have a daughter called diana who s eleven like you but if you want to play with her you ll have to be very good mrs barry is very careful about diana s friends diana what a beautiful name said anne excitedly her hair isn t red is it i hope it isn t she looked sadly at her red plaits i hate my hair diana has dark hair she s a good clever girl try to be like her anne when the two girls met they knew at once that they would be good friends they often played together in the fields or by the river or in the garden in the morning anne helped marilla with the housework then in the afternoon she played with diana or talked happily to matthew while he worked on the farm she soon knew and loved every flower tree and animal at green gables the cuthberts had another friend mrs rachel lynde she liked to know everything that was happening in and around avonlea she was very interested in the cuthberts little or phan girl so one day she visited marilla i was very surprised to hear about the child she told mar illa so you and matthew have adopted her i m surprised myself answered marilla with a smile but she s a clever little thing you know and she s always dancing or singing or laughing mrs lynde shook her head sadly what a mistake marilla you ve never had any children yourself so how can you look after her just then anne ran in from the garden she stopped sudden ly when she saw a stranger in the kitchen mrs lynde looked at the thin little girl in the short dress with her freckled face and red hair isn t she thin marilla she said just look at those freckles and hair as red as carrots anne s face went red she ran up to mrs lynde i hate you she shouted angrily i hate you you re a horrible fat old woman and she ran upstairs oh dear oh dear said mrs lynde what a terrible child you ll not have an easy time with her marilla you were rude to her rachel marilla replied before she could stop herself well said mrs lynde she got up and walked to the door i think this orphan is more important to you than i am when i think how long we ve been friends you ll have trouble with her i can tell you well i m sorry for you that s all goodbye marilla went upstairs to anne s room the child was lying on her narrow bed sobbing loudly you mustn t get angry like that anne mrs lynde is my friend and you were very rude to her she was rude to me said anne she said i was thin and freckled and red haired it was very unkind i understand how you feel said marilla but you must go to her and tell her you re sorry i can never do that said anne firmly then you must stay in your room and think about it you can come out when you agree to say that you re sorry anne stayed in her room all the next day downstairs the house was very quiet without her that evening while marilla was busy in the garden matthew went up to anne s room the child was sitting sadly by the window anne he said shyly why don t you say you re sorry then you can come down and we can all be happy i am sorry now said anne i was very angry yesterday but do you really want me to yes do please it s lonely downstairs without you but don t tell marilla i ve talked to you marilla was pleased to hear that anne was sorry later that evening when she and anne were in mrs lynde s warm kitchen anne suddenly fell on her knees oh mrs lynde cried the little girl i m very sorry i can t tell you how sorry i am so you must just imagine it i am a bad girl but please say you will forgive me i ll be sad all my life if you don t she s enjoying herself thought marilla watching anne s face she doesn t look sorry at all but happy and excited but mrs lynde said kindly of course i forgive you and later she said to marilla perhaps you re right to keep her she s a strange little thing but i think i like her at avonlea school when school started in september anne and diana walked there and back together every day what a beautiful day anne said happily one morning as the two little girls walked across the fields i m very lucky to have you as my best friend diana you are my best friend aren t you of course anne replied diana taking anne s hand and just think today you ll meet gilbert blythe he s three years older than us and very good looking he s just come back from holiday and starts school today oh boys said anne i m not interested in them but she did look at gilbert when they arrived at school he was a tall boy with curly brown hair and a friendly smile he is good looking anne whispered to diana but why does he smile at me he doesn t know me avonlea school was quiet that day the teacher mr phillips was helping some of the older children at the back of the schoolroom anne was looking out of the window at the reds and yellows of the trees and the silvery blue of the river she was far away in the world of her imagination but gilbert wanted her to look at him he whispered to her but she did not move he was surprised girls were usually very ready to look at him suddenly he put his arm out pulled her red plaits and said in a loud whisper carrots carrots anne jumped up and looked angrily at gilbert you horrible boy she cried i hate you and then she brought her heavy book down on cilbert s head mr phillips heard the noise and came slowly to the front of the schoolroom anne shirley why did you do that he asked she stayed silent gilbert said i m sorry mr phillips i was rude to her that s why she hit me but the teacher did not listen to gilbert i cannot have bad children in my school said mr phillips firmly anne go and stand in front of the class and there anne stood for the rest of the day a lonely little girl with a small white angry face i hate mr phillips she thought and i ll never look at or speak to gilbert blythe again the next day some of the school children were playing in a farmer s field in their lunch hour so they were a little late for afternoon school anne ran into the classroom at the same time as the boys just after the teacher you re late anne said mr phillips you won t sit with diana today i see that you enjoy being with the boys very much so go and sit next to gilbert this afternoon anne s face went white he can t mean it she thought did you hear me anne asked mr phillips yes sir said anne and moved slowly to gilbert s desk there she sat down and put her head on the desk with her arms over it this is the end she was thinking i wasn t the only per son who was late and he s sent me to sit with a boy and that boy is gilbert blythe the rest of the day went very slowly for anne when it was time to leave she went to her desk next to diana s and took all her books pens and pencils with her what are you doing anne asked diana i m not coming back to school replied anne firmly oh but anne we re reading a new book next week and we re playing a new game on monday and it ll be very exciting and you ll miss it anne but anne was not interested i m sorry diana was her only answer that evening marilla ran round to rachel lynde s house rachel please help me anne says she won t go back to school what am i going to say to her mrs lynde already knew about anne s troubles at school and she was always very pleased when people asked her to help she smiled and sat back comfortably i ve had ten children myself so i know all about them she said anne can stay at home for a while she ll want to go back to school again soon i m sure so anne stayed at home and only saw diana in the evenings she was a child who felt very strongly she hated gilbert blythe but she really loved diana one evening marilla found anne crying in the kitchen what s the matter child she asked in surprise i love diana very much sobbed anne i can t live with out her marilla but what will happen when she marries i hate her husband already i can imagine her in the church in her long white dress and then she ll go away and i ll nev er see her again marilla turned away to hide her smiling face what a strange funny child anne was marilla tried not to laugh but she couldn t stop herself you and your imagination anne shirley she cried and she laughed and laughed mrs lynde was right of course after a few days anne de cided to go back to school all the children were pleased to see her again but she did not speak to gilbert blythe more trouble for anne i think i ll ask the new vicar mr allan and his wife to tea on wednesday said marilla one day oh yes please do cried anne excitedly mrs allan is young and beautiful and has a very sweet smile can i make a cake for tea say yes marilla marilla agreed and for the next few days anne planned what she would put in her cake i do hope it s going to be a good one she told diana sometimes i forget to put in the right things you made a very good one last week said her friend i m sure it ll be all right on wednesday the tea party started very well these are very good cakes miss cuthbert mrs allan said to marilla you have been busy anne made this one specially for you mrs allan replied marilla oh well i must try some laughed the vicar s wife but after the first mouthful there was a very strange look on her face is anything wrong asked marilla she ate a piece of anne s cake herself oh anne what have you put in this cake she cried isn t it isn t it all right asked anne her face red all right it s horrible don t try to eat any more mrs allan anne you ve put my medicine in this cake oh i didn t know it was white and in a bottle i thought it was milk sobbed anne she ran upstairs and fell on her bed crying loudly but later that evening when mrand mrs allan went home marilla came to talk to her oh marilla cried anne everybody in avonlea will laugh at me for putting medicine in a cake marilla smiled and touched anne s hot face no they won t anne mrs allan wasn t angry you know she said it was very kind of you to make her a cake and she s asked you to tea at her house oh so she s forgiven me she is nice isn t she said anne thankfully why do i get into trouble like this perhaps i won t make any mistakes tomorrow marilla shook her head still smiling you ll think of some thing anne you re very good at making mistakes spring came with its bright green leaves and early flowers one april evening marilla came home late after visiting friends she found the kitchen empty and no supper on the table where s anne she thought crossly i told her to get the supper ready she hurried upstairs to anne s room and found the girl sobbing on her bed don t look at me marilla anne cried i know i m bad i know i am what is the matter asked marilla are you ill oh marilla i just want to die look at my hair and marilla saw that anne s long thick red hair was now a horrible dark green oh anne she said what have you done now i i bought a bottle of something special from a man who came to the door he said it would change my hair from red to black oh i know it was stupid of me but what shall i do they washed anne s hair again and again but it was still green anne stayed at home for a week saw nobody and washed her hair every day but at the end of the week maril la said i m sorry anne we ll have to cut it all off you can t go to school with green hair anne had to agree perhaps this will teach me not to think about being beautiful she said sadly everybody was surprised to see anne with very short hair but no one learned the secret and some weeks later there were some new darker red curls which pleased anne very much that summer anne and her friends often played in an old boat on the river today let s imagine that i m a prisoner and i m escaping from prison by boat said anne i ll hide in the boat and the river will carry it down to the bridge you re my family and you must meet me at the bridge the other girls agreed so anne got into the boat and hid under some coats her friends pushed the boat off down the river and ran across the fields to get round to the bridge for a few minutes the prisoner enjoyed the game but then she suddenly felt wet and sat up water was coming in very fast through a hole in the bottom of the boat luckily there were some trees by the river and anne saw a low branch over the water she jumped up and caught the branch the boat went on without her and a few seconds later went down under the water her friends on the bridge saw the boat but they did not see anne under the tree oh oh anne s dead the boat s gone down and she s in the river they screamed and ran back to the village for help poor anne could not move she held on and held on but her arms were getting tired and she knew that she would fall in a minute suddenly there was gilbert bly the in his boat anne shirley he cried what are you doing there he did not wait for an answer but quickly helped anne into his boat she didn t say a word when they arrived at the bridge she got out and turned away thank you for helping me she said coldly but gilbert jumped out and put a hand on her arm anne he said quickly i m sorry i called you carrots it was a long time ago i think your hair is really nice now can we forget it and be friends for a second anne wanted to say yes but then she remembered standing alone in front of the school children all after noon because of gilbert she would never forgive him for that no she replied coldly i shall never be your friend gilbert bly the all right gilbert jumped angrily back into his boat i ll never ask you again anne shirley anne walked home with her head held high but she felt strangely sad and wanted to cry why are you always in trouble anne asked marilla when she heard about anne s adventure well i think i m learning marilla answered anne i learn from my mistakes and after today i won t use my imagination so much i don t think avonlea is the right place for imagination no it isn t agreed marilla a little crossly when she went out matthew who was sitting quietly in his corner whispered to anne keep a little imagination anne not too much of course just a little queen s college one day marilla said anne your new teacher miss stacy spoke to me yesterday she says you must study for the examinations for queen s college in two years time then if you do well you can study at queen s in charlotte town for a year and after that you ll be a teacher oh marilla i d love to be a teacher but won t it be very expensive that doesn t matter anne when matthew and i adopted you three years ago we decided to look after you as well as we could of course we ll pay for you to study so in the afternoons anne and some of her friends stayed late at school and miss stacy helped them with the special ex amination work diana didn t want to go to queen s so she went home early but gilbert stayed he and anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies because they both wanted to be first in the examination secretly anne was sorry that she and gilbert weren t friends but it was too late now for two years anne studied hard at school she enjoyed learning and miss stacy was pleased with her but she didn t study all the time in the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends or walked through the fields with diana or sat talking to matthew your anne is a big girl now she s taller than you rachel lynde told marilla one day you re right rache said marilla in surprise and she s a very good girl now isn t she she doesn t get into trouble these days i m sure she helps you a lot with the housework marilla yes i don t know what i d do without her said marilla smiling and look at her those beautiful grey eyes and that red brown hair you know marilla i thought you and matthew made a mistake when you adopted her but now i see i was wrong you ve looked after her very well well thank you rachel replied marilla pleased that evening when matthew came into the kitchen he saw that his sister was crying what s the matter he asked surprised you haven t cried since well i can t remember when it s just well i was thinking about anne said marilla i ll i ll miss her when she goes away when she goes to queen s you mean yes but she can come home at weekends on the train i ll still miss her said marilla sadly in june the avonlea boys and girls had to go to charlotte town to take their examinations oh i do hope that i ve done well anne told diana when she arrived back at green gables the examinations were very difficult and i ve got to wait for three weeks before i know three weeks i ll die anne wanted to do better than gilbert but she also wanted to do well for matthew and marilla that was very important to her diana was the first to hear the news she ran into the kitchen at green gables and shouted look anne it s in father s newspaper you re first with gilbert out of all the students on the island oh how wonderful anne took the paper with shaking hands and saw her name at the top of the list of two hundred she could not speak well now i knew it said matthew with a warm smile you ve done well i must say anne said marilla who was secretly very pleased for the next three weeks anne and marilla were very busy anne needed new dresses to take to charlottetown the evening before she left she put on one of her new dresses to show matthew marilla watched the happy young face she remembered the strange thin little child with her sad eyes who arrived at green gables five years ago and she started crying quietly marilla why are you crying asked anne i was just thinking of you when you were a little girl said marilla and you re going away now and i ll be lonely without you anne took marilla s face in her hands marilla nothing will change perhaps i m bigger and older now but i ll al ways be your little anne and i ll love you and matthew and green gables more every day of my life marilla could not say what she felt like anne but she could show it she put her arms round her girl and held her close to her heart and so for the next year anne lived in charlottetown and went to college every day she sometimes came home at week ends but she had to study hard some of her avonlea friends were at queen s too and also her enemy gilbert blythe anne saw that he often walked and talked with other girls she felt sure that she and gilbert could have some interesting conversations but she didn t want to be the first to speak to him and he never looked at her there were examinations at the end of the college year in may anne studied very hard for them i d love to get the first place she thought or perhaps i could get the avery prize this was a prize for the student who was best at english writing and anne knew she was good at that the avery prize paid for a free place for four years at redmond college one of the best colleges in canada when news of the examinations came anne waited for her friends to tell her she heard shouting it s gilbert he s the first she felt ill but just then she heard another shout anne shirley s got the avery and then all the girls were round her laughing and shouting matthew and marilla will be pleased thought anne now i can go on studying and they won t have to pay matthew and marilla but when she arrived back at green gables anne knew at once that something was wrong matthew looked much older than before what s the matter with him anne asked marilla he s had some heart trouble this year replied marilla he really isn t well i m worried about him and you re not looking well marilla said anne now you must rest while i do the housework marilla smiled tiredly at anne it s not the work it s my head it often hurts behind my eyes i must see the doctor about it soon but another thing anne have you heard any thing about the church bank i heard it was having a difficult time all our money is in that bank i know matthew s worried about it the next morning a letter came for matthew marilla saw his grey face and cried what s the matter matthew anne who was bringing an armful of flowers into the kitchen saw his face too suddenly matthew fell to the ground anne dropped her flowers and ran to help marilla together they tried everything but it was too late matthew was dead it was his heart said the doctor who arrived a little later did he have any bad news suddenly the letter cried anne shall i see what s in it oh mar illa look the church bank has had to close down your money and matthew s has all gone everybody in avonlea was sorry to hear that matthew was dead for the first time in his life matthew cuthbert was an important person at first anne couldn t cry but then she remembered matthew s smiling face when she told him about the avery prize suddenly she started crying and couldn t stop marilla held her in her arms and they sobbed together crying can t bring him back whispered marilla we ll have to learn to live without him anne in the next few weeks anne and marilla worked hard together on the farm and in the house everybody in avonlea was very kind to them but it was a sad time one day marilla said i ll miss you when you go to red mond college anne what are the other avonlea students go ing to do some of them are going to teach and some are going to stay at queen s gilbert s going to teach at avonlea school isn t he anne didn t reply so marilla went on he s very tall and good looking now don t you think like his father john when he was younger you know john and i were very good friends years ago anne looked up interested what happened why didn t you well we had a fight about something he asked me to be friends again but i couldn t forgive him later i was sorry but he didn t speak to me again perhaps we oh well it was a long time ago the next day marilla went to see the doctor when she came back she looked very tired and ill what did the doctor say asked anne worriedly he says i mustn t read or write and i must wear glasses then my head won t hurt but if i m not very careful i ll be blind in six months for a minute anne was silent then she said firmly then you must be careful marilla think how terrible it is to be blind but how lucky you ve got a free place at redmond college i can t give you any money you see all our money s gone and i can t work now i think i ll have to sell the farm and go and live with rachel lynde and poor marilla sobbed wildly that night anne sat alone in her bedroom she thought and thought for some time and then she smiled when she went to bed she knew what she was going to do the next day she explained it all to marilla you can t sell green gables it s our home just listen i ve planned everything i m not going to redmond college it s too far away i m going to teach in one of the village schools near here then i can live there during the week and come home at weekends to look after you diana s father will use our fields and pay us for them and so we ll have some money you see oh anne i ll be all right if you re here but you must go to redmond if you want to study redmond college doesn t matter laughed anne i m going to study at home in the evenings and i m going to be a really good teacher that s better than anything marilla shook her head and tried not to cry you re a good girl anne now we can keep green gables a few days later rachel lynde came to the farm do you know she said that gilbert isn t going to be the avonlea teacher now isn t he cried anne why not when he heard that you wanted to be near marilla he de cided to teach at a school in another village so you can be the avonlea teacher now oh said anne surprised that s that s very kind of him and that day when she saw gilbert by the river she stopped him and held out her

don t know about me if you haven t read a book called the adventures of tom sawyer mr mark twain wrote the book and most of it is true in that book robbers stole some money and hid it in a very secret place in the woods but tom sawyer and i found it and after that we were rich we got six thousand dollars each all gold in those days i never had a home or went to school like tom and all the other boys in st petersburg pop was always drunk and he moved around a lot so he wasn t a very good father but it didn t matter to me i slept in the streets or in the woods and i could do what i wanted when i wanted it was a fine life when we got all that money tom and i were famous for a while judge thatcher who was an important man in our town kept my money in the bank for me and the widow douglas took me to live in her house and said i could be her son she was very nice and kind but it was a hard life because i had to wear new clothes and be good all the time in the end i put on my old clothes and ran away but tom came after me and said that i had to go back but that i could be in his gang of robbers so i went back and the widow cried and i had to put on those new clothes again i didn t like it at all her sister miss watson lived there too she was al ways saying don t put your feet there huckleberry and don t do that huckleberry it was terrible when i went up to bed that night i sat down in a chair by the window i sat there a good long time and i was really unhappy but just after midnight i heard mee yow mee yow ortside very softly i answered mee yow mee yor quietly i put out the light and got out through the window in the trees tom sawyer was waiting for me we went through the trees to the end of the widow s garden soon we were on top of a hill on the other side of the house below us we could see the river and the town one or two lights were still on but everything was quiet we went down the hill and found joe harper ben rogers and two or three more of the boys then tom took us down the river by boat to his secret place which was a cave deep in the side of a hill when we got there tom told us all his plan now we ll have this gang of robbers he said and we ll call it tom sawyer s gang if somebody hurts one of us the others will kill him and his family and if a boy from the gang tells other people our secrets we ll kill him and his family too we all thought this was wonderful and we wrote our names in blood from our fingers then ben rogers said now what s the gang going to do nothing replied tom just rob and kill we stop people on the road and we kill them and take their money and things but we can keep a few of the people and then their friends can pay money to get them back that s what they do in the stories in books but ben wasn t happy what about women he asked do we kill them too oh no tom answered we re very nice to them and they all love us and they don t want to go home then the cave will be full of women and people waiting and we ll have to watch them all night we ll all go home now tom said and we ll meet next week and we ll kill somebody and rob somebody ben wanted to begin on sunday but the others said no it was bad to kill and rob on a sunday my clothes were very dirty and i was very tired when i got back of course the next morning miss watson was angry with me because of my dirty clothes but the widow just looked unhappy soon after that we stopped playing robbers because we never robbed people and we never killed them time went on and winter came i went to school most of the time and i was learning to read and write a little it wasn t too bad and the widow was pleased with me miss watson had a slave an old man called jim and he and i were good friends i often sat talking to jim but i still didn t like living in a house and sleeping in a bed then one morning there was some new snow on the ground and outside the back garden i could see footprints in the snow i went out to look at them more carefully they were pop s footprints a minute later i was running down the hill to judge thatcher s house when he opened the door i cried sir i want you to take all my money i want to give it to you he looked surprised why what s the matter please sir take it don t ask me why in the end he said well you can sell it to me then and he gave me a dollar and i wrote my name on a piece of paper for him that night when i went up to my room pop was sitting there waiting for me i saw that the window was open so that was how he got in he was almost fifty and he looked old his hair was long and dirty and his face was a terrible white colour his clothes were old and dirty too and two of his toes were coming through his shoe he looked at me all over for a long time and then he said well just look at those clean tidy clothes and they say you can read and write now who said you could go to school the widow i began oh she did did she well you can forget about school i can t read and your mother couldn t read no one in our family could read before they died so who do you think you are go on take that book and read to me i began to read but he hit the book and it flew out of my hand across the room then he shouted they say you re rich how s that it isn t true you give me that money i want it get it for me tomorrow i haven t got any money ask judge thatcher he ll tell you i haven t got any money well give me what you ve got in your pocket now come on give it to me i ve only got a dollar and i want that to give it to me do you hear he took it and then he said he was going out to get a drink when he was outside the window he put his head back in and shouted and stop going to that school or you know what you ll get the next day he was drunk and he went to judge thatcher to get my money the judge wouldn t give it to him but pop didn t stop trying and every few days i got two or three dollars from the judge to stop pop from hitting me but when pop had money he got drunk again and made trouble in town he was always coming to the widow s house and she got angry and told him to stay away then pop got really angry and one day he caught me and took me a long way up the river in a boat i had to stay with him in a hut in the woods and i couldn t go out by myself he watched me all the time the widow sent a man to find me and bring me home but pop went after him with a gun and the man ran away huck escapes and finds a friend mostly it was a lazy comfortable kind of life but after about two months pop began to hit me too much with his stick he often went away into town too and then he always locked me in the hut once he was away for three days and i thought i was never going to get out again when he came back that time he was drunk and angry he wanted my money but judge thatcher wouldn t give it to him the judge wanted to send me to live with the widow again pop told me i wasn t very pleased about that i didn t want to go back there so i decided to escape and go down the river and live in the woods somewhere when pop was out i began to cut a hole in the wooden wall of the hut in a few days when the hole was bigger i could take the wood cut escape through the hole and put the wood back one morning pop sent me down to the river to catch some fish for breakfast to my surprise there was a canoe in the water and there was no one in it immediately i jumped into the river and brought the canoe to the side it was lucky that pop didn t see me and i decided to hide the canoe under some trees and use it when i escaped that afternoon pop locked me in and went off to town he won t be back tonight i thought so i began to work hard at my hole soon i could get out through it and i carried food and drink and pop s gun down to the canoe then i put back the wood to hide the hole took the gun and went into the woods there i shot a wild pig and took it back to the hut with me next i broke down the door with an axe i carried the pig into the hut and put some of its blood on the ground then i put some big stones in a sack and pulled it along behind me to the river last of all i put some blood and some of my hair on the axe i left the axe in a corner of the hut and i took the pig down to the river they won t know it s only a pig in the river i said to myself they ll think it s me then i took the canoe and went down the river to jackson s island by then it was nearly dark so i hid the canoe under some trees and went to sleep it was after eight o clock when i woke up the next day and the sun was high in the sky i was warm and comfortable and i didn t want to get up suddenly i heard a noise up the river carefully i looked through the trees and i saw a boat full of people there was pop judge thatcher tom sawyer and his aunt polly and his brother sid and lots of others they were looking for my body in the river i watched them but they didn t see me and in the end they went away i knew that nobody was going to come and look for me again i found a good place under the trees to sleep and to put my things then i caught a fish and cooked it over a fire i lived like that for three days and then i decided to have a look round the island so i went into the woods this is my island i thought i m the only person on it suddenly just in front of me i saw a fire and it was still smoking there was somebody on my island i didn t wait i turned and went straight back but i couldn t sleep after a time i said to myself i can t live like this i must find out who it is silently i moved along the river in my canoe under the darkness of the trees and then i stopped through the trees i could see the light of a fire afraid i left my canoe and went nearer there was a man lying by the fire suddenly he sat up and i saw that it was jim miss watson s slave i was really happy to see him hello jim i cried and i jumped out from behind the tree jim fell to his knees please don t hurt me he cried i ve always been good to dead people it s all right jim i m not dead i said but why are you here on the island i asked well huck he began old miss watson wanted to sell me a man came into town and told miss watson that he d buy me for eight hundred dollars she couldn t say no so i ran away i ran down to the river to hide but everybody in the town was there they said you were dead huck i had to wait all day to get away when it was dark i got on to a big boat and hid when we came near this island i jumped into the water and swam here jim finished his story and then we both carried all our things into a cave and hid the canoe under some trees we were just in time because then the rains came it rained for days and the river got higher and higher all kinds of things came down the river and one night there was a little wooden house lying half on its side we got the canoe out and went to take a look through the window we could see a bed two old chairs and some old clothes there was something lying in the corner and we thought it looked like a man jim went in to see but he said he s dead someone shot him in the back don t look at his face huck it s terrible i didn t want to see the dead man s face so i didn t look we just took the old clothes and a few other things and went back to our cave on the island another night when we were out looking for things on the river we found a raft it was made of good strong wood and was about four metres by five metres this could be useful i said to jim so we pulled it back to the island behind the canoe and tied it up under the trees huck and jim travel south for some days everything went along quietly but we were getting bored we wanted to know what was happening in town and so i decided to go and find out jim said why don t you wear the old dress and the hat that we found in the house people won t know you then they ll think you re a girl and so i did just after it was dark i got into the canoe and went up the river to the bottom of the town there i left the canoe and went on foot before long i came to a little house which was always empty now there was a light on and when i looked through the window i saw a woman of about forty she was a stranger and that was good because she didn t know me so i knocked on the door i must remember that i m a girl i said to myself the woman opened the door come in she said she looked at me with her little bright eyes what s your name she asked sarah williams i replied i m going to see my uncle on the other side of town my mother s ill you see and she needs help well you can t go there by yourself now it s too dark my husband will be home in about an hour wait for him and he ll walk with you and then she began to tell me about all her troubles i was getting bored with all this until she said something about pop and my murder who did it i asked well she replied some people say old finn did it him self other people think it was a slave who ran away that night his name was jim they ll give three hundred dollars to anybody who finds him and they ll give two hundred dollars for old finn he got drunk and left town with two strangers a lot of people think he killed his boy and he s going to come back one day and get all huck finn s money and what about the slave i asked oh they ll soon catch him people want the three hundred dollars i think he s on jackson s island you know i ve seen smoke there my husband s gone to get two of his friends and they re going over there with a gun later tonight when i heard this my hands began to shake the woman looked at me strangely but then she smiled and said kindly what did you say your name was m mary williams oh she said i thought it was sarah er well yes it is sarah mary williams some people call me sarah and some people call me mary you see oh do they she smiled again come on now what s your real name bill bob i know you re not really a girl so then i had to tell her another story with a different name and i said i was running away she said she wouldn t tell anybody and gave me some food before i left i hurried back to the island and jim quick jim i cried waking him up they re coming to get us we got out the raft as fast as we could put all our things on it tied the canoe on behind and moved off down the river when it began to get light we hid when it was dark again we travelled on on the fifth night we passed st louis and we decided to go on down to cairo in illinois sell the raft there and get a boat to ohio there are no slaves in ohio we slept for most of that day and we began our journey again when it was dark after some time we saw lights on the illinois side of the river and jim got very excited he thought it was cairo jim got the canoe ready and i went off in it to take a look at those lights but it wasn t cairo after that we went on down the river it was very dark that night and it wasn t easy to see where we were going suddenly a big steamboat came at us very fast and the next minute it was right over us jim and i jumped off the raft into the water the boat hit the raft and went on up the river when i came up out of the water i couldn t see jim any where i called out his name again and again but there was no answer he s dead i thought slowly i swam to the side of the river and got out i saw that i was near a big old wood en house suddenly a lot of very angry dogs jumped out at me they made a terrible noise and someone called from the house who s there george jackson i answered quickly i ve fallen off a river boat well the people who lived in that house were very kind and they took me in and gave me some new clothes and a good meal i told them that my family were all dead so they said i could stay with them as long as i wanted it was a beautiful house and the food was good there so i stayed a few days later one of the slaves in the house came to me and said come with me together we went down to some trees by the river in there he said and went away on the ground i found a man asleep it was jim i was really pleased to see him when the steamboat hit the raft jim told me the raft didn t break up jim swam after it and caught it then he began to look for me we decided to leave at once it s all right living in a house for a little while but you feel more free and easy and comfort able on a raft the duke and the king two or three days and nights went by and nothing much happened we travelled at night when it was dark and everybody was asleep we didn t want anyone to see jim and ask questions about him then one morning just after it was light i found a little canoe so i got into it and went over to the side of the river i was looking round when suddenly two men ran through the trees help they cried there are men and dogs trying to catch us but we ve done nothing wrong one of the men was about seventy years old the other was about thirty and they both had very old dirty clothes i said they could come with me and we ran quickly back to the canoe back on the raft we talked for a time and then the young man said my friends i think i can tell you my secret now i m really a duke my grandfather was the son of the duke of bridgewater but he left england and came to america when the old duke died my grandfather s younger brother stole everything and made himself the duke of bridgewater well of course we were all very unhappy for our friend the duke but he said i ll be happier if you do things for me bring me my dinner so we did things for him and he liked it but the old man spoke very little and he looked unhappy too after a time he said you know bridgewater i too have a secret and he began to cry what do you mean the duke asked what s your secret and then the old man told us that he was really the first son of the king of france he asked us all to go down on one knee when we spoke to him we could call him your majesty too so that was what we did and they were both happy of course i knew that they weren t really a duke and a king but i didn t tell jim it s best if everybody is happy when you re living together on a raft the king and the duke were very interested in jim is he a slave they wanted to know is he running away i had to tell them something so i said that jim belonged to my uncle and was taking me to my family in new orleans well we ll travel down river with you then said the king we ll have a fine time together so the four of us went on down the river but jim and i didn t like those two men they were always getting drunk and making plans to get money out of people in every town it s all right to take a chicken or something if you re hungry but these men were really bad jim and i decided to get away from them as soon as we could it wasn t easy because they wanted to be with us all the time then one morning the king went off into a town and told us to wait for him we waited all morning and he didn t come back so the duke and i went into town to look for him we looked all afternoon and in the end we found him in a bar drunk and then he and the duke began to fight about some money now we can get away from them i thought i turned and ran back to the river quick jim i shouted it s time to go but there was no answer jim wasn t there i ran into the woods crying and shouting jim s name but there was still no answer just then a boy came along have you seen a slave i asked him and i described jim why yes the boy replied he s a runaway slave i heard all about it in town a family called the phelpses have got him now an old man in a bar told mr phelps that there was a runaway slave on a raft down by the river he said he hadn t got time to take the slave back himself so mr phelps gave him forty dollars and they went down and caught the slave this afternoon the phelpses are going to take him back to his owner and they ll get three hundred dollars for him i knew those two men were bad i asked the boy where the phelpses lived and he said it was a big white house a little way down the river i began to make plans to get jim back first i took the raft and went down to a little island i hid the raft under the treesand lay down to sleep before it was light i went off down the river in the canoe when i thought i was near the phelpses place i stopped got out of the canoe and went up to the house suddenly a lot of dogs ran out they came from everywhere and they made a terrible noise a woman about fifty years old ran out of the house with some little children behind her she was smiling all over her face and she took me by the hands and cried it s you at last isn t it i didn t stop to think yes ma am i said well what took you so long we thought you were coming two days ago your uncle silas goes to town every day to meet you he s there now but he ll be back soon she didn t stop talking and i couldn t tell her that she was making a mistake tell us all about them she cried tell me everything i knew then that i had to tell her but just then she cried here he is quick hide and she pushed me inside the house and behind the front door then her husband came in and she asked him has he come no her husband replied look she shouted and then she pulled me out from be hind the door why who s that mr phelps cried surprised it s tom sawyer she laughed the plan to free jim when i heard that i nearly fell through the floor but it was a big piece of luck it was easy for me to be tom sawyer because tom was my best friend he and his brother sid lived with their aunt polly up in st petersburg and i knew all about them now i learnt that aunt polly had a sister who was mrs phelps she and her husband were tom s aunt sally and uncle silas and tom was coming down south by boat to stay with them for a bit we all sat there talking and i could answer all their questions about the sawyer family i was feeling really happy about this when suddenly i heard a boat on the river tom could be on that boat i thought and he s going to walk in here and call out my name before i can stop him i ve got to go and meet him so i told the phelpses that i would go into town to get my bags which were at the boat station i hurried up the road and before i was halfway to town there was tom sawyer coming along when he saw me his mouth fell open and he looked a bit white in the lace aren t you dead he said everybody said that you were murdered i m not dead yet i said but listen i told him about my adventures and tom loved all that then i told him about the phelpses and that they thought i was tom sawyer what shall we do i asked him tom thought for a bit and then he said i know you take my bags and say they re yours i ll come to the house in about half an hour all right i said but there s another thing you know old miss watson s slave jim who ran away well he s a prisoner here and i m going to help him escape jim tom said but he s then he stopped and thought right i ll help too i ll make a really good plan he looked very excited so i went back to the house with the bags and tom came along half an hour later he knocked on the door and when his aunt sally opened it he said he was sid tom s brother he wanted his visit to be a surprise for his dear old aunt sally he said well aunt sally was very pleased to see tom and sid she thought it was wonderful she and uncle silas were really nice people when we were alone later tom and i talked about jim s escape i said i had a plan and tom listened to it it s a good plan he said when i finished but it s too easy it s got to be a real escape like a real adventure in a sto ry book so we want something difficult and dangerous now listen to this so he told me his plan i knew it would be a good one be cause tom s plans are always crazy and exciting and we sure had a lot of fun with that plan we knew that jim was locked up in a hut outside the house every night we got out through our bedroom window and dug a hole right under the wall of the hut it took us a week and it was hard work we talked to jim secretly and told him about the plan and he was really pleased we also wrote secret letters to everybody tom said that people always do this in books we wrote that there was a gang of slave thieves coming up from the south they wanted to steal jim and get the three hundred dollars from his owner well the phelpses and their friends got very excited and on the night of the escape i went into the sitting room and there was a crowd of men in there all with guns i ran and told tom and he said that this was really good it s a real adventure now all right he said very excited perhaps they ll come after us and shoot and we ll all get killed well there wasn t time to think about it because it all happened so quickly we got jim out through the hole under the wall and began to run down to the river but the men heard us and came after us they began to shoot and so we ran as fast as we could to the canoe we got in it and went over to spanish island my raft was there and our plan was to escape on that and go on down river now jim i cried you re a free man we were all very happy but tom was the happiest of all because he had a bullet in his leg when jim and i heard that we weren t so happy tom wanted the adventure to go on but jim and i said that a doctor must look at tom s leg tom was getting angry about this but jim said you listen to me tom sawyer you say i m a free man now and perhaps i am but old jim is not going to run away and leave one of his friends with a bullet in his leg so i m staying right here until a doctor comes i knew jim would say that he was a good true friend and you can t say that about many people well that was the end of the adventure really i went and found a doctor in the town he was a kind old man and he said he would go over to the island but tom s leg got very bad and the next day the doctor and some other men carried tom home to the phelpses house they brought jim too and they locked him up in the hut again but the doctor said be kind to him because he didn t run away and he stayed to help me with the boy they took tom up to bed because his leg was really bad and aunt sally sat with him while he slept i didn t want to answer any questions so i kept out of everybody s way when tom woke up the next day he felt better i was in the room and he said to me jim s all right isn t he i didn t know what to say because aunt sally was listening and before i could stop him tom went on we did it aunt sally me and tom here we helped jim escape he told her all about the digging and everything and aunt sally s mouth was opening and closing like a fish then she got really angry with tom that slave is locked up again and he s going to stay there and if i catch you again tom suddenly sat up in bed you can t do that he cried jim was old miss watson s slave but she died two months ago before she died she wrote that she wanted jim to be free and not a slave any more jim s a free man not a slave well that was a surprise to me and aunt sally she thought tom was crazy but sid why did you help him to escape if he was free already she said i wanted the adventure of course said tom we made a really exciting plan and oh my aunt polly we turned round and there was tom s aunt polly in the doorway that was the second big surprise aunt sally was really pleased to see her sister and jumped up to put her arms round her i got under the bed as fast as i could there was trouble coming for me and tom that was for sure then aunt polly said to tom you always were a terrible boy tom sawyer and i want to know but polly dear said aunt sally this isn t tom it s sid tom was here a minute ago where is he where s huck finn you mean replied aunt polly come out from under that bed huck finn so tom and i had to explain everything aunt polly said that aunt sally wrote and told her that tom and sid were there she knew that it wasn t true so she decided to come and find out what was happening but she said that it was true about miss watson and that jim was a free man now we got jim out of the hut and aunt sally and uncle silas were really nice to him later tom jim and i had a long talk by ourselves tom talked and talked and then he said let s all three of us run away one night and go and have ad ventures in the wild country down south it sounded like a good plan to me the only thing is i said i haven t got any money to buy the right clothes and things all my money back in st petersburg will be in pop s pockets by now no said tom your money s all there your pop never came back no and he won t come back huck jim said you remember that dead man on the river when i said don t look at his face well that was your pop you can get your money when you want tom s leg is almost better now and i haven t got any more to write about i m really pleased about that because it was very difficult to write a book and i won t do it again but i think i m going to have to run away before the others because aunt sally wants me to live with her i ll have to sleep in a bed and wear clean clothes and learn to be good and i can t do that again i ve done it once already the end yours truly huck finn down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very bored she and her sister were sitting under the trees her sister was reading but alice had nothing to do once or twice she looked into her sister s book but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations she tried to think of something to do but it was a hot day and she felt very sleepy and stupid she was still sitting and thinking when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran past her there was nothing really strange about seeing a rabbit and alice was not very surprised when the rabbit said oh dear oh dear i shall be late perhaps it was a little strange alice thought later but at the time she was not surprised but then the rabbit took a watch out of its pocket looked at it and hurried on at once alice jumped to her feet i ve never before seen a rabbit with either a pocket or a watch to take out of it she thought and she ran quickly across the field after the rabbit she did not stop to think and when the rabbit ran down a large rabbit hole alice followed it immediately after a little way the rabbit hole suddenly went down deep into the ground alice could not stop herself falling and down she went too it was a very strange hole alice was falling very slowly and she had time to think and to look around her she could see nothing below her because it was so dark but when she looked at the sides of the hole she could see cupboards and books and pictures on the walls she had time to take things out of a cupboard look at them and then put them back in a cupboard lower down well thought alice after a fall like this i can fall anywhere i can fall downstairs at home and i won t cry or say a word about it down down down how far have i fallen now alice said aloud to herself perhaps i m near the centre of the earth let me think that s four thousand miles down alice was very good at her school lessons and could remember a lot of things like this down down down would she ever stop falling alice was very nearly asleep when suddenly she was sitting on the ground quickly she jumped to her feet and looked around she could see the white rabbit who was hurrying away and still talking to himself oh my ears and whiskers he was saying how late it s getting alice ran after him like the wind she was getting very near him when he suddenly turned a corner alice ran round the corner too and then stopped she was now in a long dark room with doors all round the walls and she could not see the white rabbit anywhere she tried to open the doors but they were all locked how will i ever get out again she thought sadly then she saw a little glass table with three legs and on the top of it was a very small gold key alice quickly took the key and tried it in all the doors but oh dear either the locks were too big or the key was too small but she could not open any of the doors then she saw another door a door that was only forty centimetres high the little gold key unlocked this door easily but of course alice could not get through it she was much too big so she lay on the floor and looked through the open door into a beautiful garden with green trees and bright flowers poor alice was very unhappy what a wonderful garden she said to herself i d like to be out there not in this dark room why can t i get smaller it was already a very strange day and alice was beginning to think that anything was possible after a while she locked the door again got up and went back to the glass table she put the key down and then she saw a little bottle on the table i m sure it wasn t here before said alice round the neck of the bottle was a piece of paper with the words drink me in large letters but alice was a careful girl it can be dangerous to drink out of strange bottles she said what will it do to me she drank a little bit very slowly the taste was very nice like chocolate and oranges and hot sweet coffee and very soon alice finished the bottle what a strange feeling said alice i think i m getting smaller and smaller every second and she was a few minutes later she was only twenty five centimetres high and now she said happily i can get through the little door into that beautiful garden she ran at once to the door when she got there she remembered that the little gold key was back on the glass table she ran back to the table for it but of course she was now much too small there was the key high above her on top of the table she tried very hard to climb up the table leg but she could not do it at last tired and unhappy alice sat down on the floor and cried but after a while she spoke to herself angrily come now she said stop crying at once what s the use of crying she was a strange child and often talked to herself like this soon she saw a little glass box near her on the floor she opened it and found a very small cake with the words eat me on it nothing could surprise alice now well i ll eat it she said if i get taller i can take the key off the table and if i get smaller i can get under the door one way or another i ll get into the garden so it doesn t matter what happens she ate a bit of the cake and then put her hand on top of her head which way which way she asked herself a little afraid nothing happened this was not really surprising people don t usually get taller or shorter when they eat cake but a lot of strange things were happening to alice today it will be very boring she said if nothing happens so she went on eating and very soon the cake was finished the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser said alice she was very surprised and for a minute she forgot how to speak good english i shall be as tall as a house in a minute she said she tried to look down at her feet and could only just see them goodbye feet she called who will put on your shoes now oh dear what nonsense i m talking just then her head hit the ceiling of the room she was now about three metres high quickly she took the little gold key from the table and hurried to the garden door poor alice she lay on the floor and looked into the garden with one eye she could not even put her head through the door she began to cry again and went on crying and crying the tears ran down her face and soon there was a large pool of water all around her on the floor suddenly she heard a voice and she stopped crying to listen oh the duchess the duchess she ll be so angry i m late and she s waiting for me oh dear oh dear it was the white rabbit again he was hurrying down the long room with some white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other hand alice was afraid but she needed help she spoke in a quiet voice oh please sir the rabbit jumped wildly dropped the gloves and the fan and hurried away as fast as he could alice picked up the fan and the gloves the room was very hot so she began to fan herself while she talked oh dear how strange everything is today did i change in the night am i a different person today but if i m a different person then the next question is who am i ah that s the mystery she began to feel very unhappy again but then she looked down at her hand she was wearing one of the rabbit s white gloves how did i get it on my hand she thought oh i m getting smaller again she looked round the room i m already less than a metre high and getting smaller every second how can i stop it she saw the fan in her other hand and quickly dropped it she was now very very small and the little garden door was locked again and the little gold key was lying on the glass table things are worse than ever thought poor alice she turned away from the door and fell into salt water right up to her neck at first she thought it was the sea but then she saw it was the pool of tears her tears crying makes a lot of tears when you are three metres tall oh why did i cry so much said alice she swam around and looked for a way out but the pool was very big just then she saw an animal in the water near her it looked like a large animal to alice but it was only a mouse shall i speak to it thought alice everything s very strange down here so perhaps a mouse can talk so she began oh mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming oh mouse alice did not know if this was the right way to speak to a mouse but she wanted to be polite the mouse looked at her with its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice perhaps it s a french mouse so she began again and said in french where is my cat this was the first sentence in her french lesson book the mouse jumped half out of the water and looked at her angrily oh i m so sorry cried alice quickly of course you don t like cats do you like cats cried the mouse in a high angry voice does any mouse like cats well perhaps not alice began kindly but the mouse was now swimming quickly away and soon alice was alone again at last she found her way out of the pool and sat down on the ground she felt very lonely and unhappy but after a while the white rabbit came past again looking for his white gloves and his fan the duchess the duchess oh my ears and whiskers she ll cut my head off i know she will oh where did i drop my gloves then he saw alice why mary ann what are you doing here run home at once and bring me some gloves and a fan quick now alice hurried away but where is his house she thought while she ran strangely she was no longer in the long room with the little door but outside in a wood she ran and ran but could not see a house anywhere so she sat down under a flower to rest conversation with a caterpillar now alice said to herself first i must get a little bigger and second i must find my way into that beautiful garden i think that will be the best plan but oh dear how shall i get bigger perhaps i must eat or drink something but the question is what alice looked all around her at the flowers and the trees but she could not see anything to eat then she saw a large mushroom near her it was as tall as she was she walked across to look at it and there on top of the mushroom was a large caterpillar smoking a pipe after a while the caterpillar took the pipe out of its mouth and said to alice in a slow sleepy voice who are you i don t really know sir said alice i know who i was when i got up this morning but i have changed so often since then i think i am a different person now what do you mean by that said the caterpillar explain yourself i can t explain myself sir said alice because i m not myself you know i don t know said the caterpillar it s difficult to describe alice replied politely one minute i m very small the next minute i m as tall as a house then i m small again usually i stay the same all day and changing so often feels very strange to me you said the caterpillar in a very unfriendly voice who are you they were now back at the beginning of their conversation which was not very helpful alice felt a little cross and decided to walk away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve something important to say this sounded better so alice turned back never get angry said the caterpillar is that all said alice trying not to be angry no said the caterpillar for some minutes it smoked its pipe and did not speak but at last it took the pipe out of its mouth and said so you ve changed have you how tall do you want to be i would like to be a little larger sir please said alice eight centimetres is really very small for a while the caterpillar smoked its pipe then it shook itself got down off the mushroom and moved slowly away into the grass it did not look back at alice but said one side will make you taller and the other side will make you shorter one side of what thought alice to herself she did not say this aloud but the caterpillar said mushroom then it moved away into the wood alice looked at the mushroom carefully but it was round and did not have sides at last she broke off a piece in each hand from opposite sides of the mushroom she ate some of the piece in her left hand and waited to see what would happen a minute later her head was as high as the tallest tree in the wood and she was looking at a sea of green leaves then a bird appeared and began to fly around her head screaming egg thief egg thief go away i m not an egg thief said alice oh no said the bird angrily but you eat eggs don t you well yes i do but i don t steal them explained alice quickly we have them for breakfast you know then how do you get them if you don t steal them screamed the bird this was a difficult question to answer so alice brought up her right hand through the leaves and ate a little from the other piece of mushroom she began to get smaller at once and very carefully she ate first from one hand then from the other until she was about twenty five centimetres high that s better she said to herself and now i must find that garden she began to walk through the wood and after a while she came to a little house the cheshire cat there was a boy outside the door with a large letter in his hand he was dressed like a boy but his face was very like a fish alice thought the fish boy knocked at the door and a second later a large plate came flying out of an open window a letter for the duchess the fish boy shouted he pushed the letter under the door and went away alice went up to the door and knocked but there was a lot of noise inside and nobody answered so she opened the door and walked in she found herself in a kitchen which was full of smoke there was a very angry cook by the fire and in the middle of the room sat the duchess holding a screaming baby every few minutes a plate crashed to the floor there was also a large cat which was sitting on a chair and grinning from ear to ear please alice said politely to the duchess why does your cat grin like that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess that s why i didn t know that cats could grin said alice well you don t know much said the duchess another plate crashed to the floor and alice jumped here the duchess went on you can hold the baby for a bit if you like the queen has invited me to play croquet and i must go and get ready she pushed the baby into alice s arms and hurried out of the room oh the poor little thing said alice looking at the baby which had a very strange face she took it outside into the wood and walked around under the trees then the baby began to make strange noises and alice looked into its face again its eyes were really very small for a baby and its nose now looked very like the nose of a pig don t make noises like that my dear said alice it s not polite you re beginning to sound like a pig but a few minutes later there was no mistake it was a pig alice put it carefully on the ground and it ran quietly away on its four legs into the wood i m pleased about that alice said to herself it will be a good looking pig but it would be terrible to be a child with a face like that she was thinking about pigs and children when she suddenly saw the cheshire cat in a tree the cat grinned at her and she went nearer to it please she said can you tell me which way to go from here but where do you want to get to said the cat it doesn t really matter began alice then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat but i would like to get somewhere alice explained if you just go on walking said the cat in the end you ll arrive somewhere that was true thought alice but not very helpful so she tried another question what kind of people live near here to the left the cat said lives a hatter and to the right lives a march hare you can visit either of them they re both mad but i don t want to visit mad people said alice we re all mad here you know said the cat i m mad you re mad how do you know that i m mad said alice of course you re mad said the cat only mad people come here alice was thinking about this but the cat went on are you playing croquet with the queen today i would like to very much said alice but nobody has invited me yet you ll see me there said the cat and vanished alice was not really surprised at this because so many strange things were happening today she was still looking at the tree when suddenly the cat appeared again i forgot to ask said the cat what happened to the baby it turned into a pig alice said i m not surprised said the cat and vanished again alice began to walk on and decided to visit the march hare it s the month of may now she said to herself so perhaps the hare won t be as mad as he was in march suddenly there was the cheshire cat again sitting in another tree alice jumped in surprise do you think she said politely that you could come and go more slowly all right said the cat and this time it vanished very slowly first its tail went then its body then its head and last the grin well i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but never a grin without a cat soon she saw the house of the march hare in front of her it was a large house so she ate a little piece of mushroom to get bigger and walked on a mad tea party there was a table under a tree outside the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea a dormouse was sitting between them asleep the three of them were all sitting together at one corner of the table but the table was large and there were many other seats alice sat down in a big chair at one end have some coffee the march hare said in a friendly voice alice looked all round the table but she could only see a teapot i don t see any coffee she said there isn t any said the march hare then why did you ask me to have some said alice crossly it wasn t very polite of you it wasn t very polite of you to sit down we haven t invited you to tea said the march hare but there are lots of seats said alice your hair s too long said the hatter looking at alice with interest it s not polite to say things like that said alice the hatter looked surprised but he said why is a bird like a desk alice was pleased she enjoyed playing wordgames so she said that s an easy question do you mean you know the answer said the march hare yes said alice then you must say what you mean the march hare said i do alice said quickly well i mean what i say and that s the same thing you know no it isn t said the hatter listen to this i see what i eat means one thing but i eat what i see means something very different alice did not know what to say to this so she took some tea and some bread and butter while she thought about it the dormouse woke up for a minute and then went to sleep again after a while the hatter took out his watch shook it then looked at it sadly two days slow i told you that butter wasn t good for watches he said angrily to the march hare it was the best butter said the march hare sadly alice was looking at the watch with interest it s a strange watch she said it shows the day of the week but not the time but we know the time said the hatter it s always six o clock here alice suddenly understood is that why there are all these cups and plates she said it s always tea time here and you go on moving round the table is that right but what happens when you come to the beginning again don t ask questions said the march hare crossly you must tell us a story now but i don t know any stories said alice then the march hare and the hatter turned to the dormouse wake up dormouse they shouted loudly in its ears tell us a story yes please do said alice the dormouse woke up and quickly began to tell a story but a few minutes later it was asleep again the march hare poured a little hot tea on its nose and the hatter began to look for a clean plate alice decided to leave and walked away into the wood she looked back once and the march hare and the hatter were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot well i won t go there again said alice what a stupid tea party it was just then she saw a door in one of the trees how curious she thought but everything is strange today i think i ll go in so she went in and there she was back in the long room with the little glass table at once she picked up the gold key from the table unlocked the little door into the garden and then began to eat a piece of mushroom when she was down to about thirty centimetres high she walked through the door and then at last she was in the beautiful garden with its green trees and bright flowers the queen s game of croquet near the door there was a rose tree and three gardeners who were looking at the roses in a very worried way what s the matter alice said to them you see miss said the first gardener these roses are white but the queen only likes red roses and she the queen said the second gardener suddenly and at once the three gardeners lay down flat on their faces alice turned round and saw a great crowd of people it was a pack of cards walking through the garden there were clubs they were soldiers and diamonds and ten little children they were hearts next came some kings and queens then alice saw the white rabbit and behind him the knave of hearts and last of all came the king and queen of hearts when the crowd came near to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said who are you my name is alice your majesty said alice very politely but she thought to herself they re only a pack of cards i don t need to be afraid of them and who are these said the queen looking at the three gardeners then she saw the white roses and her face turned red and angry off with their heads she shouted and soldiers hurried up to take the gardeners away the queen turned to alice can you play croquet she shouted yes shouted alice come on then shouted the queen the crowd began to move on and alice went with them it s it s a very fine day said a worried voice in her ear alice saw that the white rabbit was by her side very fine said alice where s the duchess shhh said the rabbit in a hurried voice she s in prison waiting for execution what for said alice but just then the queen shouted get to your places and the game began it was the strangest game of croquet in alice s life the balls were hedgehogs and the mallets were flamingoes and the hoops were made by soldiers who turned over and stood on their hands and feet alice held her flamingo s body under her arm but the flamingo turned its long neck first this way and then that way at last alice was ready to hit the ball with the flamingo s head but by then the hedgehog was tired of waiting and was walking away across the croquet ground and when both the flamingo and the hedgehog were ready there was no hoop the soldiers too were always getting up and walking away it really was a very difficult game alice thought the players all played at the same time and they were always arguing and fighting for hedgehogs nobody could agree about anything very soon the queen was wildly angry and went around shouting off with his head or off with her head about once a minute alice began to feel worried the queen is sure to argue with me soon she thought and what will happen to me then they re cutting people s heads off all the time here i m surprised there is anyone left alive just then she saw something very strange she watched carefully and after a minute or two she saw that the thing was a grin it s the cheshire cat she said to herself now i ll have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat when its mouth appeared alice waited i can t talk to something without ears she thought slowly the cat s eyes then its ears and then the rest of its head appeared but it stopped at the neck and its body did not appear alice began to tell the cat all about the game it s very difficult to play she said everybody argues all the time and the hoops and the hedgehogs walk away how do you like the queen said the cat quietly i don t said alice she s very just then she saw the queen behind her so she went on clever she s the best player here the queen smiled and walked past who are you talking to said the king he came up behind alice and looked at the cat s head in surprise it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice i m not sure that i like it said the king but it can touch my hand if it likes i prefer not to said the cat well said the king angrily he called out to the queen my dear there s a cat here and i don t like it the queen did not look round off with its head she shouted call for the executioner alice was a little worried for her friend but when the executioner arrived everybody began to argue i can t cut off a head said the executioner if there isn t a body to cut it off from you can cut the head off said the king from anything that s got a head if somebody doesn t do something quickly said the queen i ll cut everybody s head off nobody liked that plan very much so they all turned to alice and what do you say they cried the cat belongs to the duchess said alice carefully perhaps you could ask her about it she s in prison the queen said to the executioner bring her here at once but then the cat s head slowly began to vanish and when the executioner came back with the duchess there was nothing there the king ran wildly up and down looking for the cat and the duchess put her arm round alice i m so pleased to see you again my dear she said let s get on with the game the queen said angrily and alice followed her back to the croquet ground the game went on but all the time the queen was arguing and shouting off with his head or off with her head soon there were no hoops left because the soldiers who were the hoops were too busy taking everybody to prison and at the end there were only three players left the king the queen and alice the queen stopped shouting and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet no said alice i m not sure what a mock turtle is then come with me said the queen they found the mock turtle down by the sea next to him was a gryphon asleep in the sun then the queen hurried away saying i have to get on with some executions the gryphon woke up and said sleepily to alice it s just talk you know they never execute anybody alice was pleased to hear this she felt a little afraid of the gryphon and the mock turtle because they were so large but they were very friendly and sang songs and told her many stories about their lives the mock turtle was in the middle of a very sad song when they all heard a shout a long way away it s beginning come on we must hurry cried the gryphon it took alice by the hand and began to run who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were sitting on their thrones when alice and the gryphon arrived there was a great crowd of birds and animals and all the pack of cards soldiers stood all around the knave of hearts and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand in the middle of the room there was a table with a large plate of tarts on it they look good thought alice who was feeling a little hungry then the white rabbit called out loudly silence the trial of the knave of hearts will now begin he took out a long piece of paper and read the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them all away very good said the king call the first witness alice looked at the jury who were now writing everything down it was a very strange jury some of the jurymen were animals and the others were birds then the white rabbit blew his trumpet three times and called out first witness the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other hand i m very sorry your majesty he said i was in the middle of tea when the trial began take off your hat the king said it isn t mine said the hatter stolen write that down the king said to the jury i keep hats to sell explained the hatter i don t have a hat myself i m a hatter give your evidence said the king or we ll cut your head off the hatter s face turned white i m a poor man your majesty he began in a shaking voice just then alice had a strange feeling after a minute or two she understood what it was don t push like that said the dormouse who was sitting next to her i m nearly falling off my seat i m very sorry alice said politely i m getting bigger and taller you see well you can t do that here said the dormouse crossly and he got up and moved to another seat the hatter was still giving evidence but nobody could understand a word of it the king looked at the queen and the queen looked at the executioner the unhappy hatter saw this and dropped his bread andbutter i m a poor man your majesty he said again you re a very poor speaker said the king he turned to the white rabbit call the next witness he said the next witness was the duchess s cook who spoke very angrily and said that she would not give any evidence the king looked worried and told the white rabbit to call another witness alice watched while the white rabbit looked at the names on his piece of paper then to her great surprise he called out loudly alice here cried alice jumping to her feet what do you know about these tarts said the king nothing said alice the queen was looking hard at alice now she said all people a mile high must leave the room i m not a mile high said alice and i won t leave the room i want to hear the evidence there is no more evidence said the king very quickly and now the jury will your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry we ve just found this letter there s no name on it but i think the knave wrote it no i didn t said the knave loudly read it to us said the king where shall i begin your majesty asked the rabbit begin at the beginning said the king and go on until you get to the end then stop everybody listened very carefully while the white rabbit read these words they tell me you have been to her and talked of me to him she thought i was a gardener but said i could not swim he tells them that i have not gone we know that this is true if she decides to hurry on what will they do to you i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you but they were mine before that s a very important piece of evidence said the king he looked very pleased now the jury must if anybody in the jury can explain that letter said alice she was not afraid of anything now because she was much bigger than everybody in the room i ll give him sixpence it s all nonsense it doesn t mean anything the jury busily wrote this down she thinks it s all nonsense all nonsense eh said the king he read some of the words again but said i could not swim you can t swim can you he said to the knave the knave s face was sad do i look like a swimmer he said and he didn t because he was made of paper the king smiled i understand everything now he said there are the tarts and here is the knave of hearts and now the jury must decide who the thief is no no said the queen off with his head the jury can say what it thinks later what nonsense said alice loudly the jury must decide first you can t be quiet said the queen her face turning red i won t said alice off with her head screamed the queen nobody moved it doesn t matter what you say said alice you re only a pack of cards then the pack of cards flew up into the sky and began to fall on alice s face she gave a little scream and woke up she was lying next to her sister under the trees and some leaves were falling on her face wake up alice dear said her sister you ve been asleep a long time oh i ve had a very curious dream said alice and she told her sister all about the strange adventures in her wonderful dream a surprise for the cuthberts matthew cuthbert lived with his sister marilla on their farm on prince edward island in canada their farmhouse green gables was just outside the little village of avonlea matthew was nearly sixty and had a long brown beard his sister was five years younger they were both tall and thin with dark hair everybody in avonlea knew that the cuthberts were quiet people who worked very hard on their farm one afternoon matthew drove the horse and cart to the sta tion has the five thirty train arrived yet he asked the sta tion master yes the man replied and there s a passenger who s waiting for you a little girl a little girl asked matthew but i ve come for a boy the children s home is sending us one of their orphan boys we re going to adopt him you see and he s going to help me with the farm work well perhaps the children s home didn t have any boys so they sent you a girl answered the stationmaster carelessly here she is matthew turned shyly to speak to the child she was about eleven with long red hair in two plaits her face was small white and thin with a lot of freckles and she had large grey green eyes she was wearing an old brown hat and a dress which was too small for her are you mr cuthbert of green gables she asked excitedly in a high sweet voice i m very happy to come and live with you and belong to you i ve never belonged to anyone you see the people at the children s home were very kind but it s not very exciting to live in a place like that is it matthew felt sorry for the child how could he tell her that it was all a mistake but he couldn t just leave her at the sta tion he decided to take her home with him marilla could ex plain the mistake to her he was surprised that he enjoyed the journey home he was a quiet shy man and he didn t like talking himself but to day he only had to listen because the little girl talked and talked and talked she told him all about herself while they drove along my parents died when i was a baby you know and for the last three years i ve had to work for my food i ve lived with three different families and looked after their children so i ve always been poor and i haven t got any nice dresses but i just imagine that i m wearing the most beautiful blue dress and a big hat with flowers on and blue shoes and then i m happy do you imagine things sometimes well i i not often said matthew they were now driving past some very old apple trees next to the road the trees were full of sweet smelling snowywhite flowers the little girl looked at them aren t the trees beautiful she said happily but am i talking too much please tell me i can stop if necessary you know matthew smiled at her you go on talking he answered i like listening to you when they arrived at green gables marilla came to the door to meet them but when she saw the little girl she cried in surprise matthew who s that where s the boy the children s home has made a mistake he said unhappily and sent a girl not a boy the child was listening carefully suddenly she put her head in her hands and began to cry you you don t want me she sobbed oh oh you don t want me because i m not a boy now now don t cry said marilla kindly don t you understand oh this is the worst thing that s happened to me in all my life well you can stay here just for tonight said marilla now what s your name the child stopped crying will you please call me cordelia she asked call you cordelia is that your name well no it isn t but it s a very beautiful name isn t it i like to imagine my name is cordelia because my real name is anne shirley and that s not a very interesting name is it marilla shook her head the child has too much imagina tion she thought later when anne was in bed marilla said to her brother she must go back to the children s home tomorrow marilla don t you think began matthew she s a nice little thing you know matthew cuthbert are you telling me that you want to keep her asked marilla crossly matthew looked uncomfortable well she s clever and interesting and but we don t need a girl but perhaps she needs us matthew replied surprisingly quickly for him she s had a very unhappy life up to now marilla she can help you in the house i can get a boy from the village to help me on the farm what do you think marilla thought for a long time all right she said in the end i agree the poor child can stay i ll look after her matthew smiled happily be as good and kind to her as you can marilla i think she needs a lot of love at green gables and so the next morning marilla said well anne matthew and i have decided to keep you only if you re a good girl of course why child what s the matter i m crying sobbed anne because i m very happy it s beautiful here people say i m very bad but i ll try very hard to be good oh thank you thank you now stop crying child said marilla a little crossly and listen we re going to adopt you and send you to school after the summer holidays anne stopped crying can i call you aunt marilla i ve never had any family at all so i d really like to have an aunt we could imagine that you re my mother s sister i couldn t answered marilla firmly don t you imagine things asked anne surprised no i don t marilla replied i do my housework and look after matthew and go to church on sunday there s no time for imagining things in this house just remember that anne anne was silent for a few minutes then she said marillam do you think i ll find a best friend in avonlea someone who really understands me and knows all my secrets i ve always wanted a friend like that our friends the barrys have a daughter called diana who s eleven like you but if you want to play with her you ll have to be very good mrs barry is very careful about diana s friends diana what a beautiful name said anne excitedly her hair isn t red is it i hope it isn t she looked sadly at her red plaits i hate my hair diana has dark hair she s a good clever girl try to be like her anne when the two girls met they knew at once that they would be good friends they often played together in the fields or by the river or in the garden in the morning anne helped marilla with the housework then in the afternoon she played with diana or talked happily to matthew while he worked on the farm she soon knew and loved every flower tree and animal at green gables the cuthberts had another friend mrs rachel lynde she liked to know everything that was happening in and around avonlea she was very interested in the cuthberts little or phan girl so one day she visited marilla i was very surprised to hear about the child she told mar illa so you and matthew have adopted her i m surprised myself answered marilla with a smile but she s a clever little thing you know and she s always dancing or singing or laughing mrs lynde shook her head sadly what a mistake marilla you ve never had any children yourself so how can you look after her just then anne ran in from the garden she stopped sudden ly when she saw a stranger in the kitchen mrs lynde looked at the thin little girl in the short dress with her freckled face and red hair isn t she thin marilla she said just look at those freckles and hair as red as carrots anne s face went red she ran up to mrs lynde i hate you she shouted angrily i hate you you re a horrible fat old woman and she ran upstairs oh dear oh dear said mrs lynde what a terrible child you ll not have an easy time with her marilla you were rude to her rachel marilla replied before she could stop herself well said mrs lynde she got up and walked to the door i think this orphan is more important to you than i am when i think how long we ve been friends you ll have trouble with her i can tell you well i m sorry for you that s all goodbye marilla went upstairs to anne s room the child was lying on her narrow bed sobbing loudly you mustn t get angry like that anne mrs lynde is my friend and you were very rude to her she was rude to me said anne she said i was thin and freckled and red haired it was very unkind i understand how you feel said marilla but you must go to her and tell her you re sorry i can never do that said anne firmly then you must stay in your room and think about it you can come out when you agree to say that you re sorry anne stayed in her room all the next day downstairs the house was very quiet without her that evening while marilla was busy in the garden matthew went up to anne s room the child was sitting sadly by the window anne he said shyly why don t you say you re sorry then you can come down and we can all be happy i am sorry now said anne i was very angry yesterday but do you really want me to yes do please it s lonely downstairs without you but don t tell marilla i ve talked to you marilla was pleased to hear that anne was sorry later that evening when she and anne were in mrs lynde s warm kitchen anne suddenly fell on her knees oh mrs lynde cried the little girl i m very sorry i can t tell you how sorry i am so you must just imagine it i am a bad girl but please say you will forgive me i ll be sad all my life if you don t she s enjoying herself thought marilla watching anne s face she doesn t look sorry at all but happy and excited but mrs lynde said kindly of course i forgive you and later she said to marilla perhaps you re right to keep her she s a strange little thing but i think i like her at avonlea school when school started in september anne and diana walked there and back together every day what a beautiful day anne said happily one morning as the two little girls walked across the fields i m very lucky to have you as my best friend diana you are my best friend aren t you of course anne replied diana taking anne s hand and just think today you ll meet gilbert blythe he s three years older than us and very good looking he s just come back from holiday and starts school today oh boys said anne i m not interested in them but she did look at gilbert when they arrived at school he was a tall boy with curly brown hair and a friendly smile he is good looking anne whispered to diana but why does he smile at me he doesn t know me avonlea school was quiet that day the teacher mr phillips was helping some of the older children at the back of the schoolroom anne was looking out of the window at the reds and yellows of the trees and the silvery blue of the river she was far away in the world of her imagination but gilbert wanted her to look at him he whispered to her but she did not move he was surprised girls were usually very ready to look at him suddenly he put his arm out pulled her red plaits and said in a loud whisper carrots carrots anne jumped up and looked angrily at gilbert you horrible boy she cried i hate you and then she brought her heavy book down on cilbert s head mr phillips heard the noise and came slowly to the front of the schoolroom anne shirley why did you do that he asked she stayed silent gilbert said i m sorry mr phillips i was rude to her that s why she hit me but the teacher did not listen to gilbert i cannot have bad children in my school said mr phillips firmly anne go and stand in front of the class and there anne stood for the rest of the day a lonely little girl with a small white angry face i hate mr phillips she thought and i ll never look at or speak to gilbert blythe again the next day some of the school children were playing in a farmer s field in their lunch hour so they were a little late for afternoon school anne ran into the classroom at the same time as the boys just after the teacher you re late anne said mr phillips you

sat back comfortably i ve had ten children myself so i know all about them she said anne can stay at home for a while she ll want to go back to school again soon i m sure so anne stayed at home and only saw diana in the evenings she was a child who felt very strongly she hated gilbert blythe but she really loved diana one evening marilla found anne crying in the kitchen what s the matter child she asked in surprise i love diana very much sobbed anne i can t live with out her marilla but what will happen when she marries i hate her husband already i can imagine her in the church in her long white dress and then she ll go away and i ll nev er see her again marilla turned away to hide her smiling face what a strange funny child anne was marilla tried not to laugh but she couldn t stop herself you and your imagination anne shirley she cried and she laughed and laughed mrs lynde was right of course after a few days anne de cided to go back to school all the children were pleased to

anne everybody in avonlea will laugh at me for putting medicine in a cake marilla smiled and touched anne s hot face no they won t anne mrs allan wasn t angry you know she said it was very kind of you to make her a cake and she s asked you to tea at her house oh so she s forgiven me she is nice isn t she said anne thankfully why do i get into trouble like this perhaps i won t make any mistakes tomorrow marilla shook her head still smiling you ll think of some thing anne you re very good at making mistakes spring came with its bright green leaves and early flowers one april evening marilla came home late after visiting friends she found the kitchen empty and no supper on the table where s anne she thought crossly i told her to get the supper ready she hurried upstairs to anne s room and found the girl sobbing on her bed don t look at me marilla anne cried i know i m bad i know i am what is the matter asked marilla are you ill oh marilla i just want to die look at my hair and marilla saw that anne s long thick red hair was now a horrible dark green oh anne she said what have you done now i i bought a bottle of something special from a man who came to the door he said it would change my hair from red to black oh i know it was stupid of me but what shall i do they washed anne s hair again and again but it was still green anne stayed at home for a week saw nobody and washed her hair every day but at the end of the week maril la said i m sorry anne we ll have to cut it all off you can t go to school with green hair anne had to agree perhaps this will teach me not to think about being beautiful she said sadly everybody was surprised to see anne with very short hair but no one learned the secret and some weeks later there were some new darker red curls which pleased anne very much that summer anne and her friends often played in an old boat on the river today let s imagine that i m a prisoner and i m escaping from prison by boat said anne i ll hide in the boat and the river will carry it down to the bridge you re my family and you must meet me at the bridge the other girls agreed so anne got into the boat and hid under some coats her friends pushed the boat off down the river and ran across the fields to get round to the bridge for a few minutes the prisoner enjoyed the game but then she suddenly felt wet and sat up water was coming in very fast through a hole in the bottom of the boat luckily there were some trees by the river and anne saw a low branch over the water she jumped up and caught the branch the boat went on without her and a few seconds later went down under the water her friends on the bridge saw the boat but they did not see anne under the tree oh oh anne s dead the boat s gone down and she s in the river they screamed and ran back to the village for help poor anne could not move she held on and held on but her arms were getting tired and she knew that she would fall in a minute suddenly there was gilbert bly the in his boat anne shirley he cried what are you doing there he did not wait for an answer but quickly helped anne into his boat she didn t say a word when they arrived at the bridge she got out and turned away thank you for helping me she said coldly but gilbert jumped out and put a hand on her arm anne he said quickly i m sorry i called you carrots it was a long time ago i think your hair is really nice now can we forget it and be friends for a second anne wanted to say yes but then she remembered standing alone in front of the school children all after noon because of gilbert she would never forgive him for that no she replied coldly i shall never be your friend gilbert bly the all right gilbert jumped angrily back into his boat i ll never ask you again anne shirley anne walked home with her head held high but she felt strangely sad and wanted to cry why are you always in trouble anne asked marilla when she heard about anne s adventure well i think i m learning marilla answered anne i learn from my mistakes and after today i won t use my imagination so much i don t think avonlea is the right place for imagination no it isn t agreed marilla a little crossly when she went out matthew who was sitting quietly in his corner whispered to anne keep a little imagination anne not too much of course just a little queen s college one day marilla said anne your new teacher miss stacy spoke to me yesterday she says you must study for the examinations for queen s college in two years time then if you do well you can study at queen s in charlotte town for a year and after that you ll be a teacher oh marilla i d love to be a teacher but won t it be very expensive that doesn t matter anne when matthew and i adopted you three years ago we decided to look after you as well as we could of course we ll pay for you to study so in the afternoons anne and some of her friends stayed late at school and miss stacy helped them with the special ex amination work diana didn t want to go to queen s so she went home early but gilbert stayed he and anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies because they both wanted to be first in the examination secretly anne was sorry that she and gilbert weren t friends but it was too late now for two years anne studied hard at school she enjoyed learning and miss stacy was pleased with her but she didn t study all the time in the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends or walked through the fields with diana or sat talking to matthew your anne is a big girl now she s taller than you rachel lynde told marilla one day you re right rache said marilla in surprise and she s a very good girl now isn t she she doesn t get into trouble these days i m sure she helps you a lot with the housework marilla yes i don t know what i d do without her said marilla smiling and look at her those beautiful grey eyes and that red brown hair you know marilla i thought you and matthew made a mistake when you adopted her but now i see i was wrong you ve looked after her very well well thank you rachel replied marilla pleased that evening when matthew came into the kitchen he saw that his sister was crying what s the matter he asked surprised you haven t cried since well i can t remember when it s just well i was thinking about anne said marilla i ll i ll miss her when she goes away when she goes to queen s you mean yes but she can come home at weekends on the train i ll still miss her said marilla sadly in june the avonlea boys and girls had to go to charlotte town to take their examinations oh i do hope that i ve done well anne told diana when she arrived back at green gables the examinations were very difficult and i ve got to wait for three weeks before i know three weeks i ll die anne wanted to do better than gilbert but she also wanted to do well for matthew and marilla that was very important to her diana was the first to hear the news she ran into the kitchen at green gables and shouted look anne it s in father s newspaper you re first with gilbert out of all the students on the island oh how wonderful anne took the paper with shaking hands and saw her name at the top of the list of two hundred she could not speak well now i knew it said matthew with a warm smile you ve done well i must say anne said marilla who was secretly very pleased for the next three weeks anne and marilla were very busy anne needed new dresses to take to charlottetown the evening before she left she put on one of her new dresses to show matthew marilla watched the happy young face she remembered the strange thin little child with her sad eyes who arrived at green gables five years ago and she started crying quietly marilla why are you crying asked anne i was just thinking of you when you were a little girl said marilla and you re going away now and i ll be lonely without you anne took marilla s face in her hands marilla nothing will change perhaps i m bigger and older now but i ll al ways be your little anne and i ll love you and matthew and green gables more every day of my life marilla could not say what she felt like anne but she could show it she put her arms round her girl and held her close to her heart and so for the next year anne lived in charlottetown and went to college every day she sometimes came home at week ends but she had to study hard some of her avonlea friends were at queen s too and also her enemy gilbert blythe anne saw that he often walked and talked with other girls she felt sure that she and gilbert could have some interesting conversations but she didn t want to be the first to speak to him and he never looked at her there were examinations at the end of the college year in may anne studied very hard for them i d love to get the first place she thought or perhaps i could get the avery prize this was a prize for the student who was best at english writing and anne knew she was good at that the avery prize paid for a free place for four years at redmond college one of the best colleges in canada when news of the examinations came anne waited for her friends to tell her she heard shouting it s gilbert he s the first she felt ill but just then she heard another shout anne shirley s got the avery and then all the girls were round her laughing and shouting matthew and marilla will be pleased thought anne now i can go on studying and they won t have to pay matthew and marilla but when she arrived back at green gables anne knew at once that something was wrong matthew looked much older than before what s the matter with him anne asked marilla he s had some heart trouble this year replied marilla he really isn t well i m worried about him and you re not looking well marilla said anne now you must rest while i do the housework marilla smiled tiredly at anne it s not the work it s my head it often hurts behind my eyes i must see the doctor about it soon but another thing anne have you heard any thing about the church bank i heard it was having a difficult time all our money is in that bank i know matthew s worried about it the next morning a letter came for matthew marilla saw his grey face and cried what s the matter matthew anne who was bringing an armful of flowers into the kitchen saw his face too suddenly matthew fell to the ground anne dropped her flowers and ran to help marilla together they tried everything but it was too late matthew was dead it was his heart said the doctor who arrived a little later did he have any bad news suddenly the letter cried anne shall i see what s in it oh mar illa look the church bank has had to close down your money and matthew s has all gone everybody in avonlea was sorry to hear that matthew was dead for the first time in his life matthew cuthbert was an important person at first anne couldn t cry but then she remembered matthew s smiling face when she told him about the avery prize suddenly she started crying and couldn t stop marilla held her in her arms and they sobbed together crying can t bring him back whispered marilla we ll have to learn to live without him anne in the next few weeks anne and marilla worked hard together on the farm and in the house everybody in avonlea was very kind to them but it was a sad time one day marilla said i ll miss you when you go to red mond college anne what are the other avonlea students go ing to do some of them are going to teach and some are going to stay at queen s gilbert s going to teach at avonlea school isn t he anne didn t reply so marilla went on he s very tall and good looking now don t you think like his father john when he was younger you know john and i were very good friends years ago anne looked up interested what happened why didn t you well we had a fight about something he asked me to be friends again but i couldn t forgive him later i was sorry but he didn t speak to me again perhaps we oh well it was a long time ago the next day marilla went to see the doctor when she came back she looked very tired and ill what did the doctor say asked anne worriedly he says i mustn t read or write and i must wear glasses then my head won t hurt but if i m not very careful i ll be blind in six months for a minute anne was silent then she said firmly then you must be careful marilla think how terrible it is to be blind but how lucky you ve got a free place at redmond college i can t give you any money you see all our money s gone and i can t work now i think i ll have to sell the farm and go and live with rachel lynde and poor marilla sobbed wildly that night anne sat alone in her bedroom she thought and thought for some time and then she smiled when she went to bed she knew what she was going to do the next day she explained it all to marilla you can t sell green gables it s our home just listen i ve planned everything i m not going to redmond college it s too far away i m going to teach in one of the village schools near here then i can live there during the week and come home at weekends to look after you diana s father will use our fields and pay us for them and so we ll have some money you see oh anne i ll be all right if you re here but you must go to redmond if you want to study redmond college doesn t matter laughed anne i m going to study at home in the evenings and i m going to be a really good teacher that s better than anything marilla shook her head and tried not to cry you re a good girl anne now we can keep green gables a few days later rachel lynde came to the farm do you know she said that gilbert isn t going to be the avonlea teacher now isn t he cried anne why not when he heard that you wanted to be near marilla he de cided to teach at a school in another village so you can be the avonlea teacher now oh said anne surprised that s that s very kind of him and that day when she saw gilbert by the river she stopped him and held out her hand gilbert she said shyly i i want to thank you it s very good of you if i m the avonlea teacher i can help mar illa much more at home i m happy to help you anne said gilbert he smiled and held her hand firmly are we going to be friends now have you forgiven me for calling you carrots anne laughed i forgave you a long time ago i m sure we re going to be very good friends anne can i walk home with you and when anne came into the green gables kitchen maril la said you look very happy anne was that gilbert who was with you just now yes replied anne her face red gilbert and i ve decided to be friends oh marilla i think life is going to be good for all of us we ll have to work hard but we ll be happy and we ll keep our dear old green gables what could be better than that coming to england my name is carol sanders i live in england now but when i was younger i lived in hong kong my father was a businessman there and my mother worked as a secretary we lived in hong kong for seven years i was happy at school with lots of friends and we had a good time i liked pop music the rolling stones david bowie and jake rosso were my favourites jake rosso was my favourite singer he died in a car accident the year i left school but i listened to his pop records all the time i had hundreds of pictures and photos of him on my bedroom wall then one day in winter when i was seventeen things began to go wrong for me my father went to australia on business i loved him very much and didn t like him going away come home quickly i always said to him he was in australia for two weeks then on the day of his journey home an aeroplane from sydney crashed into the sea just south of hong kong everybody on the plane died i heard about the plane crash on television at first i did not think about my father then i remembered he was flying back from sydney on that day oh no i cried i telephoned the airport but they did not know the names of all the passengers then perhaps my father didn t get that plane i thought oh please please my mother was at work and i called her on the telephone she came home quickly and we went to the airport and waited for news later we learned my father was on the plane it s not true i shouted but it was true and i began to cry i cried for weeks and weeks i spent many days alone in my room i was lonely and sad and i wanted to die too i stopped going out with my friends i didn t want to see other people i stopped listening to jake rosso s records and took his pictures off my bedroom wall i didn t listen to music or watch television nothing mattered any more then i stopped crying i stopped feeling sad and began to feel angry why did it happen to him i asked my mother why do the best people die jake rosso my father i i don t know carol my mother said she was unhappy too at the time of the plane crash i was a student at college i enjoyed the college work and life very much but after my father s death i stopped doing my work at the college i began to go out with some new friends they were different from my other friends and my mother didn t like them they re bad people carol she told me they do dangerous things they re exciting i said and i like them i knew she was angry but i didn t care but then i learned my new friends took drugs and i began to take drugs too it was wrong and stupid i know that now but i was unhappy and angry the police came to the college to arrest some of the students they didn t arrest me but i had to leave the college it was a bad time my mother was very unhappy with me what am i going to do with you carol she said i m sorry i told her we ll go back to england she said you can find a college there perhaps

husband died in a plane crash last year so we ve come back to live in england where did you live before hong kong we lived in india for three years then greta ross took my mother into a room and asked

minute mrs sanders i want to make a phone call she went back into the room and closed the door i was sitting on a chair near the door and i could just hear greta ross s voice speaking on the phone i think i ve found someone she was saying she has a daughter but the girl can work in the garden or on the farm don t worry they ve been away from england for ten years it ll be all right i tell you don

worried about that phone call i didn t understand it the island we went to scotland the next day first by plane then by train greta ross travelled with us i looked out of the train window and saw fields and villages and mountains mum is right i thought scotland is a very beautiful place you re going to be my husband s secretary greta ross told my mother he s a businessman but he never leaves the island he does all his work by telephone and letter and computer he invests money in companies all over the world do many people live on the island i asked not many said greta ross you ll meet them soon greta ross is young i thought is her husband young too how can a young man buy an island is he very rich after the train we went on mr ross s boat which took us out to the island the boatman was a young man he had dark hair and was brown from the sun this is tony said greta ross he works for mr ross hi said tony soon we were near the island i could see the beaches and the cliffs the boat slowed down there are dangerous rocks around the island explained tony a lot of them are under the water and you can t see them i have to be careful but the rocks keep other boats away and that pleases mr ross why i asked tony looked at greta ross but she wasn t listening mr ross doesn t like visitors to the island tony said in a quiet voice then greta ross looked at us and tony said no more why doesn t mr ross like visitors i thought has he something to hide when we arrived on the island my mother and i followed greta up to the house it was very big and there were trees all around it a woman was waiting inside the house this is mrs duncan tony s mother said greta she s the housekeeper and her husband is the gardener mrs duncan will take you up to your rooms i m going to tell mr ross you ve arrived the housekeeper was a little woman with short hair she went up the stairs and my mother and i went after her my room was next to my mother s i looked out of the win dow and saw the garden at the back of the house a man was working in the garden near some trees is that mr duncan i thought i looked between the trees and saw the sea it s a beautiful house and a beautiful island that evening we had dinner with mr and mrs duncan and tony we ate in the big kitchen what happened to mr ross s last secretary asked my mother she s in hospital replied mrs duncan she s going to be away all summer isn t mrs ross lonely here i said no said mrs duncan she likes painting a lot she has a room upstairs and goes there to paint she s very good sometimes she goes to different places on the island to paint pictures we finished eating our meal soon after greta ross came into the kitchen mr ross wants to see you and your daughter now mrs sanders she said follow me please we followed her through the house and into a big room this was mr ross s office and he was sitting behind a desk i was surprised he was a young man about thirty he had a moustache short dark hair and he wore glasses mr ross was speaking into the telephone who does he look like i thought is it tony duncan mr ross is talking to a business friend in new york said greta please sit down while we waited i looked around the office there were three telephones a computer and lots of books and papers there was another door and i could see a smaller room next to the office there was a smaller desk and another computer in there mr ross finished speaking on the phone then looked care fully at my mother and me for a few seconds he didn t speak and just watched us then he said i m pleased to meet you mrs sanders i need some help with my work my secretary is in hospital and there s a lot of work to do sometimes you have to work late at night because of time differences in new york and tokyo is that all right yes that s all right said my mother can you use a computer yes good he looked at me is this your daughter yes this is carol said my mother hallo i said greta says you like gardening there s a big garden here so you can help mr duncan and there s a farm dan and stella parks live in the farmhouse and work on the farm you can help them too we have some animals some sheep a few cows and chickens and there s a horse called smoke he s grey like his name can you ride yes i said i can ride a horse you can ride smoke around the is land if you like i d like that i said thank you and we grow vegetable and fruit he said i work on the farm sometimes i enjoy it i smiled at him but he didn t smile back carol will enjoy working on the farm said my mother won t you carol yes i said mr ross looks sad i thought but how did he get all his money and why does he hide away on an island the photograph i worked in the garden for the first two days the weather was hot and sunny i liked working with mr duncan and he was pleased with my work you re a good gardener he said i ve always liked gardening i said but i m studying at college to be a farmer sometimes i saw greta ross she likes to be alone i thought once or twice i saw greta go out with her painting things she went up on the hills or down to the beach mr duncan took me to the farm and i met dan and stella parks they were very friendly you can work on the farm for the next three days said day parks mr duncan says you re a good gardener are you a good farmer too i smiled at him i am i said he smiled back so i worked on the farm with mr and mrs parks they were nice people i helped with the cows and the chickens and went up on the hills with mr parks and his dog to look after the sheep one afternoon i went out riding smoke was a big lazy friendly horse i enjoyed riding and smoke knew his way around the island very well i learned new places to go to i rode along the cliff top and then in between some trees when we came out of the trees i saw the house from the other side i tried to find the window of my room which one was it suddenly i saw a face at one of the windows the face was looking at me it was there for just a second or two then it moved away quickly who was thst i thought was it mr ross and which room was it i didn t see my mother very much that first week she worked all day and in the evenings she wrote letters to south america japan canada and australia sometimes she worked after i was in bed mr ross works hard she told me he invests money in many companies and countries but it s not his money it s not i was surprised by this no it s his wife s money and she bought the island it s her island her house her farm everything belongs to her how strange but why does mr ross always look sad and why does he never leave the island i asked i don t know said my mother he says he likes it here and likes working on his farm it s strange i know sometimes when i finished work i walked along the beaches or the cliffs or i went swimming in the sea i liked swimming greta ross often came to the beach to swim but mr ross never came stay away from the rocks carol greta ross told me they re very dangerous i will i said sometimes i took my camera to the beach and took photographs of some of the boats that went by i took photographs of the birds on the cliffs there were other small islands near our island and boats with tourists stopped at them but no boats stopped at our island they kept away from the dangerous rocks tony was right the island did not have visitors one day i was walking back to the house and had my camera with me i stopped and looked at the big house mr duncan was working in the garden in front of it at first he didn t see me i m going to take a photograph of the house i thought the sun is in just the right place and it will make a good picture i looked at the building through my camera and took the photograph mr ross was coming out of a door he was in my picture too and he looked angry that s all right i thought it s still a good photograph but mr duncan was running across the grass he came quickly up to me and said give me your camera he looked very worried wbat s wrong i asked in surprise i gave him the camera never take photographs of mr ross he said and then he opened the back of my camera and took out the film hey what are you doing i said you ll spoil my film but he didn t stop sorry he said and he put the film into his pocket but no pictures of mr ross he doesn t like people to take pictures of him mr ross was watching us he saw the camera and he saw mr duncan take out the film but he said nothing then he turned and went back into the house later i told my mother about mr duncan and the camera he spoiled my film i said i don t understand she said why did he do that i don t know i said but there s something strange about mr ross about a week later i finished work early one day and came back to the house my mother was working in her small room next to mr ross s office mrs duncan was in the kitchen greta ross was painting in her room upstairs i went to my room and began reading a book i was sitting beside the window after half an hour i got tired of reading i looked out at the rain and the grey sea and rocks between the trees my book isn t very interesting i thought i got up and went out of my room i walked along the passage and turned a corner then i saw the door at the end of the passage there was a large plant in a plant pot outside the door where dogs that door go i thought i haven t seen it before i remembered the face at the window in my first week on the island perhaps it s the door to that room i thought i walked along to the door and turned the handle the door didn t move it was locked what are you doing said a voice behind me i turned round quickly and saw greta ross she looked angry that room is private she said i m sorry i said i didn t stay away from there she told me i told my mother about the locked door what s behind it i said is it a secret i don t know said my mother it doesn t matter mr ross can have locked rooms if he wants them i think he does have secrets i said there s something strange about him there s something strange about this island somebody isn t telling us something something important my mother laughed stop playing detective carol she said the locked room two days ater there was a storm in the middle of the night i was hot and i couldn t sleep i got out of bed went across to the window and looked out at the night black clouds hur ried across the sky and the trees moved wildly in the wind the rain made a loud noise on the window i opened my window and put my head out into the wind and the rain i looked at the other windows in the house most of them were dark but one window had a light in it somebody isn t sleeping i thought which room is that there were six windows between my window and the room with the light and there are six doors between my room and the locked door i thought that light is in the locked room somebody s in there i put on my dressing gown and went out of my room the house was dark and at first i couldn t see very well i walked along the passage and turned the corner there it was the locked room and there was a light under the door i went nearer and heard noises somebody s moving about in the locked room i thought who is it then the light went off and the door opened i was afraid to move somebody came out of the room and into the dark passage lightning suddenly lit up the house and i saw who it was it s mr ross i thought what was he doing in that room in the middle of the night i didn t move and he didn t see me he locked the door of the room carefully he didn t put the key in his pocket but hid it in the plant pot next to the door he s coming along here i thought i must get back to my room and i ran back along the passage mr ross heard me who s that he called i didn t answer but ran into my room and closed the door he came along the passage and stopped outside my door then he walked past and went on down the stairs i took off my dressing gown and went back to bed i was shaking because i was afraid now i know how to get into the locked room i thought but what s in there there was no storm in the morning but it was still raining i got up early and worked on the farm there were eggs from the chickens and i put them in boxes i helped to milk the cows and then took them out to the field later i went back into the house for breakfast did you sleep all right last night asked mrs duncan or did the storm wake you up i slept all right i said i didn t want to tell her about the light in the locked room or about mr ross after breakfast i went back upstairs mr ross was talking on the telephone in his office my mother was working at her desk i knew that mrs duncan was in the kitchen and that mr duncan was working in the garden where s mrs ross i thought then i looked out of the window and saw her with tony duncan they were walking to the boat he s taking her out in the boat i thought perhaps she s going to edinburgh the boat moved away from the island and i waited until it was out at sea then i opened the door of my room there was nobody in the passage and i ran along to the locked room the key was still in the plant pot and i took it out my hand was shaking then i unlocked the door a dead man i went into the room and i was very surprised the room was full of strange things coloured shirts and suits three guitars and there were posters and photographs on the walls i looked at the posters jake rosso s face looked down at me i looked at the dead jake rosso s pictures and i remembered all the photographs on the walls of my room in hong kong i could never forget that face the face of my favourite singer then while i looked at his face something strange happened i began to see another face in the posters an older face and with a moustache but the same face i saw the face of mr ross no i said it s not true but it was i knew it was mr ross is jake rosso no said a voice behind me i turned round and saw mr ross he was standing in the doorway he looked afraid i don t believe you i said you have to believe me i looked at the posters who is that if it s not you it s jake rosso he was my brother that s not true i shouted i don t believe you listen jake rosso was my favourite singer i had hundreds of pho tos of him i still have all his records i loved him do you understand thousands of people loved him he s dead mr ross said quietly no i shouted you re jake rosso you look different now yes you ve got short hair you ve got a moustache now and you wear glasses but you re jake rosso you were my favourite pop star so i know mr ross said nothing and watched my face he doesn t know what to do i thought he knows i don t believe him and he s afraid then he said it was you in the passage last night wasn t it yes i answered he looked angry i was wrong to give your mother a job he said i thought it was ok because you came from hong kong and i needed help with my work i needed a good secretary does your other secretary know who you are i asked do the other people on the island know mr ross didn t answer but walked across to the window he was thinking what s he going to do i thought then he turned round ok you re right i i am jake rosso i knew it he looked worried and unhappy can you keep a secret a very important secret i thought for a minute then i said yes i can keep a secret then he told me the other people on this island are my family your family i said yes my real name is

life is bettter now i work on a farm in england and my mother works in an office my mother doesn t worry about me because i m happier now i haven t been back to the island but i know there s a dead man living there txtba www txtba com marley s ghost it is important to remember that jacob marley was dead did scrooge know that of course he did scrooge and marley had been partners in london for many years and excellent men of business they were too when marley died scrooge continued with the business alone both names still stood above the office door scrooge and marley sometimes people who were new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names he did not care what name they called him the only thing that mattered to him was the business and making money oh he was a hard clever mean old man scrooge was there was nothing warm or open about him he lived a secretive lonely life and took no interest in other people at all the cold inside him made his eyes red and his thin lips blue and his voice high and cross it put white frost on his old head his eyebrows and his chin the frost in his heart made the air around him cold too in the hottest days of summer his office was as cold as ice and it was just as cold in winter nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with a happy smile my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no poor man asked him for money no children asked him the time no man or woman ever in all his life asked him the way animals as well as people were afraid of him dogs used to hide in doorways when they saw him coming but what did scrooge care it was just what he wanted he liked being on the edge of people s busy lives while warning everyone to keep away from him one christmas eve old scrooge was working busily in his office it was cold frosty foggy weather outside it was already dark although it was only three o clock in the afternoon and there were candles in all the office windows the fog covered everything like a thick grey blanket scrooge kept his office door open in order to check that his clerk bob cratchit was working bob spent his days in a dark little room a kind of cupboard next to his employer s office scrooge had a very small fire but bob s fire was much smaller it was very cold in the cupboard and bob had to wear his long white scarf to try to keep warm merry christmas uncle god bless you cried a happy voice scrooge s nephew had arrived bah said scrooge crossly humbug christmas is humbug surely you don t mean that uncle said his nephew i do said scrooge why do you call it merry christmas you re too poor to be merry well replied the nephew smiling why are you so cross you re too rich to be unhappy of course i m cross answered the uncle when i live in a world full of stupid people like you you say merry christmas but what is christmas just a time when you spend too much when you find yourself a year older and not an hour richer when you have to pay your bills everyone who goes around saying merry christmas should have his tongue cut out yes he should uncle please don t say that said the nephew i ve always thought of christmas as a time to be helpful and kind to other people it s the only time of the year when men and women open their hearts freely to each other and so uncle although i ve never made any money from it i think christmas has been and will be a good time for me and i say god bless christmas bob in the cupboard agreed loudly without thinking he immediately realized his mistake and went quickly back to his work but scrooge had heard him if i hear another sound from you said scrooge you ll lose you job don t be angry with him uncle said the nephew come and have dinner with us tomorrow dinner with you i ll see you dead first but why won t you come why because christmas is humbug good afternoon i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why can t we be friends good afternoon said scrooge i am sorry with all my heart to find you like this i have never wanted to argue with you but i came to see you and invite you because it s christmas and so i ll say a merry christmas uncle good afternoon said scrooge and a happy new year good afternoon said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word stopping only to wish bob cratchit a merry christmas then two other gentlemen came in they were large round comfortable looking men with books and papers in their hands this is scrooge and marley s i think said one of them looking at the papers that he was carrying am i speaking to mr scrooge or mr marley mr marley is dead scrooge replied he died seven years ago today on christmas eve i m sure that you are just as kind to the poor as your partner said the gentleman smiling what was true was that scrooge was just as mean as marley and marley had been just as mean as scrooge at this happy time of year mr scrooge the gentleman went on taking up his pen we should help poor people who have no food or clothes or homes are there no prisons asked scrooge coldly plenty of prisons said the gentleman and the workhouses where poor people can live and work are they still open yes they are i m sorry to say i m happy to hear it said scrooge i thought from what you said at first that perhaps these useful places were closed for some reason but some of us feel replied the gentleman that these places don t offer enough to poor people we re hoping to give some meat and drink and wood for a fire to people who need all these things this is a time when we should all be able to enjoy ourselves how much will you give sir nothing scrooge replied i don t have a merry christmas myself and i won t pay for other people to be merry we all have to pay for prisons and workhouses they cost enough the poor will have to go there many can t go there and many prefer to die if they prefer to die why don t they die then there are too many people in the world so it s a good thing if some of them die all this is none of my business it s enough for a man to understand his own business and not to think about other people s i m a very busy man good afternoon gentlemen the gentlemen shook their heads a little sadly and left the office scrooge went back to his work feeling pleased with himself now the fog was at its thickest outside and the cold was biting lights shone brightly from the shop windows people were hurrying here and there rich and poor alike to buy what they needed for tomorrow s christmas dinner at last it was time to close the office scrooge got up slowly from his desk bob was waiting for this moment and he immediately put on his hat you ll want a holiday all day tomorrow i suppose said scrooge if you don t mind sir i do mind it s not fair i have to pay you for a day s work when you don t do any work it s only once a year sir said bob politely that s no reason for robbing me every twenty fifth of december said scrooge putting on his coat but i suppose you must have it be here early next morning yes sir i will i promise bob said happily scrooge walked out without another word when bob had closed the office he ran home to his family in camden town as quickly as possible scrooge always used to eat his dinner alone in the same miserable little eating house tonight was no different from other nights he read the newspapers looked at his bank books and went home to bed he lived in rooms which had once belonged to his dead partner they were in an old dark building in a lonely side street where no one except scrooge lived in the blackness of the night through the fog and the frost scrooge had to feel his way along the street with his hands he finally reached his front door and put the key in the lock suddenly to his great surprise he saw that the knocker was not a knocker any more but had become the face of jacob marley he had not thought of his partner for seven years until that afternoon when he spoke marley s name to his visitors but there in front of him was marley s face white and ghostly with terrible staring eyes as scrooge looked it became a knocker again he was afraid but he did not show his fear he turned the key opened the door and walked in he did look around before he shut the door and he did look behind the door to see if anyone was hiding there but there was nothing there he shut the door with a bang to show that he was not afraid with his one candle he went slowly up the stairs it was impossible to see into all the dark corners darkness was cheap and scrooge liked it but he remembered the face so he walked through all his rooms checking that everything was all right nobody under the table or the bed nobody behind the door on the small fire in the bedroom there was a pot of soup and scrooge s bowl was ready on the table nobody in any of the rooms sure that he was safe now scrooge shut and locked his bedroom door behind him he sat down by the fire to eat his soup the fireplace was an old one with hundreds of pictures on the tiles around the fire but scrooge could only see marley s face on every tile humbug said scrooge to the tiles and walked across the room when he sat down again he noticed a bell on the other side of the room as he looked he saw with great surprise and fear that the bell was slowly beginning to move from side to side soon it was ringing loudly and so was every bell in the house suddenly they all stopped ringing at the same moment and then came a strange noise from down below it sounded like someone pulling heavy chains across the floor scrooge remembered hearing that ghosts in old houses sometimes pulled chains behind them then a door below opened with a crash and the noise started coming up the stairs it was coming towards his door it s humbug still cried scrooge but the colour left his face when without stopping it came straight through the heavy locked door and appeared in front of him it was marley s ghost scrooge could see right through its body around its middle was a long chain which had money boxes keys bank books and heavy purses on it the ghost s death cold eyes stared fixedly at scrooge well said scrooge trying to pretend that nothing strange was happening what do you want and who are you in life i was your partner jacob marley it s humbug i tell you said scrooge there are no ghosts but when he said this the ghost gave a terrible cry and shook its chain in a very frightening way at once scrooge fell on the ground in great fear crying yes yes you are real i see that now why have you come why do ghosts come back from the dead tell me jacob the spirit of every man who does not help other people in life has to travel endlessly through the world after his death we have to carry the chains that we made for ourselves in our lifetime do you ebenezer scrooge recognize my chain it is very like the one that you wear scrooge looked around him but could see no chain jacob he said please tell me more i cannot help you much ebenezer i cannot rest i cannot stay anywhere for long i have been dead for seven years and all that time i have been travelling on the wings of the wind no peace no rest for me in death because i was never good or kind in life but you were always a good man of business jacob said scrooge who was now beginning to worry about his own life business cried the ghost miserably why didn t i think of people as my business i thought only about making money not about being kind and helpful to other people listen to me ebenezer i am here tonight to warn you you still have a chance to save yourself from what has happened to me three spirtis will come to visit you the first tomorrow at one o clock the second at the same time the next night and the third at midnight the following night you will not see me any more and for your own peace after death remember what i have told you the spirit walked slowly backwards to the window which began to open when the ghost reached the window it held up its hand and scrooge listened he could hear a noise of sad crying in the air the spirit began to cry too and it moved out into the frosty dark night to join the others scrooge ran to the window outside the air was full of spirits all wearing chains like marley s ghost all crying miserably as they realized too late the terrible mistakes that they had made in their lives little by little the spirits and their voices disappeared into the fog and the darkness and the night was silent again scrooge closed the window and checked his bedroom door it was still locked he started to say humbug but stopped suddenly perhaps because he was very tired or because it was late he went straight to bed without taking off his clothes and fell asleep immediately the first of the three spirits when scrooge woke up it was very dark in the room he heard the church clock start striking and listened to see what the time was to his great surprise the heavy bell went on striking up to twelve then stopped twelve o clock it was past two in the morning when he had gone to bed the clock must be wrong he looked at his watch it said twelve o clock too have i slept all day is it the next night already scrooge asked himself or has something happened to the sun perhaps it s midday not midnight but that s impossible he climbed out of bed and felt his way to the window but there was nobody outside in the dark foggy streets and he realized it must be night time he went back to bed again but could not sleep he was worried because he could not understand what was happening was marley s ghost a dream he wondered but it seemed very real he lay awake until he heard the clock striking a quarter to the hour suddenly he remembered the ghost had warned him that a spirit would visit him at one o clock he decided to stay awake until one o clock had passed the quarter of an hour passed very slowly but at last he heard the clock striking the four quarters it s one o clock cried scrooge delightedly and nothing has happened but he spoke before the hour bell had sounded the clock now struck a deep sad one and immediately light shone into scrooge s bedroom the curtains round his bed were pulled open scrooge sat up in bed and stared at his ghostly visitor a strange figure half like a child half like an old man looked back at him it had long white hair but its skin was soft and young it wore a short white robe covered with both summer and winter flowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the top of its head shone a bright clear light perhaps this light was sometimes too bright because under one arm it carried a hat which looked like a large extinguisher who and what are you sir asked scrooge i am the ghost of christmas past replied the spirit in a soft gentle voice do you mean long ago in the past asked scrooge no your past spirit please tell me why you are here i am here for your own good answered the ghost thank you replied scrooge politely but secretly he thought bah a night of unbroken sleep is a more useful thing to have the spirit seemed to hear him thinking and said at once i am here to help you change your life watch and listen it put out a strong hand and held scrooge by the arm get up and come with me it was dark and cold outside scrooge did not want to go anywhere and for a moment he thought about pretending to be too ill to go out but he did not like to refuse so he said nothing and got out of bed together they passed through the wall of the house out into the darkness suddenly scrooge realized they were standing on an open country road with fields on each side london the fog and the darkness had all disappeared and it was a clear cold winter day with snow on the ground good heavens cried scrooge i was born near here i rememher it well the spirit looked kindly at the old man how strange that you ve forgotten it for so many years what is that on your face are you crying scrooge put a hand over his eyes it s nothing i ve got a cold that s all take me where you want spirit scrooge recognized every field post and tree as they walked along the road towards a little market town all around thgm were young schoolboys on horses and in farmers carts laughing and wishing each other a merry christmas as they travelled to their homes for the christmas holiday they are only shadows from the past said the spirit they cannot see us scrooge knew and named all of them why was he so delighted to see them why did his cold heart beat faster when they went past shouting merry christmas what was merry christmas to scrooge what good had it ever done to him not everyone has left the school said the ghost there is one lonely child there still one child whose friends have all gone i know said scrooge and now he was crying openly they turned into a smaller road and soon came to the school inside in the long cold silent classroom a lonely boy sat reading near a small fire when he saw his poor forgotten past self scrooge sat down at one of the desks put his head in his hands and cried poor boy i wish but it s too late now what s the matter asked the spirit there was a boy singing christmas carols at my door yesterday i m sorry i didn t give him anything that s all the ghost smiled and lifted its hand saying let s see another past christmas the schoolroom became darker and dirtier there was the young scrooge again a little older and bigger than before he was not reading this time but was walking up and down looking very unhappy the door opened and a little girl much younger than him came running in putting her arms round his neck she said lovingly to him i ve come to bring you home dear brother father is so much kinder than he used to be the other day i asked him if you could come home and he said yes and we re going to spend christmas together and have the merriest time she was laughing delightedly as she began to pull him towards the door they went out happily together hand in hand what a warm heart she had said the ghost you re right said scrooge i agree with you spirit she married i understand continued the ghost and had children i think before she died one child answered scrooge true said the ghost your nephew scrooge did not answer at once yes he said at last now the school had disappeared and they were in the middle of a busy town with shadowy crowds and carts all around them here it was christmas time again but it was evening and there were lights in the shops and streets the ghost stopped at an office door do you know this place scrooge he asked know it cried scrooge why i was a clerk here they went in and when they saw a large kind looking old gentleman sitting at a high desk scrooge cried excitedly good heavens it s old fezziwig god bless him it s fezziwig alive again old fezziwig put down his pen and looked at the clock fastening his coat buttons over his fat stomach he started laughing as he called out in a rich deep happy voice ebenezer dick seven o clock no more work tonight it schristmas eve remember the young scrooge hurried in with another clerk that s dick wilkins said scrooge quietly to the ghost he always liked me oh dear poor dick together the two young clerks put away all the pens and papers and following fezziwig s orders cleared all the furniture away from the centre of the room in came a fiddler in came mrs fezziwig fat and smiling in came the three fezziwig daughters sweet and pretty in came the six young men who were in love with them in came the cook with her young man the milkman in came the boy from next door with the girl from the house opposite in they came some quietly some noisily but all happy because it was ghristmas eve the fiddler started playing and away they all went in the dance twenty pairs at the same time round and round down the middle and up again when they were all tired old fezziwig cried out well done now have something to eat and drink there was cake and hot meat and bread and cold meat and fruit and all kinds of drinks on a long table near the door and after they had eaten they danced again when the clock struck eleven the dancing ended mr and mrs fezziwig stood by the door shaking hands with each person as he or she went out and wishing him or her a merry christmas during this time scrooge had thought of nothing except what was happening in front of his eyes he remembered and enjoyed it all with the greatest delight but when the dancing came to an end he realized that the ghost was looking at him the light on the spirit s head was burning very clearly it seems easy enough to amuse these childish people said the ghost it was nothing much that fezziwig did was it after all he only spent a few pounds on food and drink and paying the fiddler it isn t a question of money replied scrooge warmly he was speaking like the young man he used to be not the old man he was now no spirit you see our employer can make us happy or sad his words his looks all these things are so important the happiness that he gives is just as valuable as money he suddenly stopped speaking when he felt the spirit watching him closely what s the matter asked the ghost er nothing said scrooge just that i d like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk now now scrooge could see himself again he was older now and it was clear that he was beginning to show an unhealthy interest in money his eyes were restless and his mouth looked thin and mean he was not alone but was sitting beside a lovely young girl the light that shone brightly from the ghost of christmas past showed that she was crying i know it doesn t matter very much to you she said softly you care about gold more than you care about me perhaps i shouldn t be sad money will give you the happiness that i wanted to give you but i haven t changed towards you have i you have changed we promised to marry a long time ago when we were both poor and happy to be poor i have stayed the same but you have different hopes and dreams now i loved the man that you used to be but i know that you do not wish to marry me any more so i ve come to tell you that you re free be happy in the life that you ve chosen and she left him spirit cried scrooge show me no more take me home this is too painful one shadow more said the ghost no more cried scrooge i don t wish to see any more but the spirit held his arms and he could not escape now they were in another place in a room which was not very large but comfortable near the fire sat a beautiful young girl scrooge thought she was the girl that he had just seen until he saw her now a good looking married lady sitting opposite her daughter the room was full of children and noise and shouting and laughing just then the door opened and the father entered carrying a great pile of christmas presents the noise became twice as loud as the children received their presents with delight and kissed their father gratefully finally the younger ones went upstairs to bed and scrooge watched more sadly than ever as the father sat down with his loving daughter and her mother by the fire belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon guess who mr scrooge he was sitting alone in his office his partner is dying and i don t think he has any other friends spirit said scrooge in a broken voice take me away from this place these are shadows of the things that happened in the past said the ghost you chose the life that you preferred so why cry now i can t watch any more it s too awful leave me alone spirit and scrooge noticing that the ghostly light was burning high and bright suddenly took the extinguisher and pushed it down hard on the spirit s head but although it covered the ghost s head and body scrooge could not hide the light which continued to shine out strongly from underneath now scrooge found himself back in his own bedroom again feeling very tired he climbed into bed and at once fell into a deep heavy sleep the second of the three spirits when scrooge woke up he realized immediately that the church clock was just going to strike one he felt sure that the second spirit would soon visit him this time he wanted to be ready so he pulled back all the curtains round his bed himself and lay there waiting at one o clock instead of a spirit a strong light shone down on scrooge s bed he felt very frightened after a few minutes he thought that perhaps the light was coming from the next room so he got up and went to the door when he touched it a strange voice called his name and asked him to enter he obeyed although he recognized it as his own room it looked very different now the walls were covered with bright green leaves and there was a good fire burning in the fireplace on the floor were big plies of the best christmas food wonderful rich dark cakes warm soft bread colourful apples and oranges plates of yellow butter cooked chickens boxes of chocolates and sugared sweets sitting beside all this was a large smiling spirit who called out cheerfully to scrooge come in chme in man i am the ghost of christmas present look at me since the first ghost s visit scrooge was no longer very sure of himself so although the spirit s eyes were clear and kind scrooge was afraid to look straight into its face but he could see that its body was dressed in a long green robe its long brown hair fell freely down its back and its face wore a warm and friendly smile light shone from the torch which it was holding in its strong right hand spirit said scrooge quietly take me where you want last night i learned a lesson which is working now if you have anything to teach me tonight let me learn from you touch my robe said the spirit and scrooge obeyed the food the room the fire all disappeared and they were standing outside in the cold snowy streets on christmas morning althought the sky was grey and the streets were dirty the people looked surprisingly cheerful as they hurried to the bakers shops with their christmas dinners all ready for cooking the spirit seemed specially interested in poor people he stood with scrooge in a baker s doorway and held his torch over the dinners as they were carried past him sometimes when he saw people pushing each other or getting angry he lifted his torch over their heads and immediately they became kinder or stopped arguing because it s christmas they told each other what does your torch do spirit asked scrooge it gives a special taste to people s dinners on this day answered the spirit why do you use it most on poor people said scrooge because poor people need it most was the reply they went on through london and came to the small house where scrooge s clerk lived here the spirit smiled and held his torch high over the door inside bob cratchit s wife and second daughter belinda in their everyday dresses but looking clean and pretty were putting plates on the table for their christmas dinner bob s son peter was helping to cook the potatoes and two smaller cratchits a boy and a girl were running round excitedly just then the eldest daughter martha arrived home from work here s martha mother cried the two young cratchits happily we re having a really big chicken for dinner martha in fact it was only a small chicken but it seemed large to the excited children my dear how late you are said mrs cratchit kissing her daughter several times we were so busy yesterday mother replied the girl that s why we didn t finish until this morning well never mind now that you re here god bless you sit down by the fire my dear no no father s coming ried the two young cratchits hide martha hide so martha hid herself and in came bob in his thin coat and long white scarf with his son tiny tim in his arms poor tiny tim he had not walked since he was born and although he could pull himself and his thin little legs along with the help of a wooden crutch he was not strong enough to travel far alone why where s martha cried bob looking round not coming said mrs cratchit not coming repeated bob his cheerful smile disappearing not coming on christmas day but martha didn t like to worry her father for a minute so she ran out from behind the door and kissed him while the two young cratchits showed tiny tim the chicken now ready to eat scrooge and the spirit watched as the family sat down to eat it was a poor enough meal but to them it seemed wonderful and they ate every bit of it it s the best chicken i ve ever tasted said bob smiling round at his family who with their mouths full all agreed and then the most exciting moment of the day belinda put a clean plate in front of each person and they all turned to look at mrs cratchit as she came in from the kitchen her face was hot from her morning s work but she was smiling happily as she carried in the christmas pudding in its little circle of blue fire oh it was a wonderful pudding they were all delighted with it it s your greatest success in all the years that we ve been married my dear said bob well i did wonder how much fruit to put in it said his wife but yes it s a good one and she laughed just like a young girl nobody said that it was a very small pudding for a large family nobody even thought it no cratchit ever said or thought things like that at last when they had finished their meal the children cleared the table and washed the plates then they all sat round the fire eating apples and oranges there was a large bowl of fruit and sugar and hot water and something a little stronger but only three people could drink at the same time because the family only owned two glasses and a cup but this did not worry the cratchits at all now bob lifted his glass and said a merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us the family repeated his wish and tiny tim said last of all god bless us every one he sat very close to his father on a small chair bob held his son s thin little hand in this own the boy had a special place in his father s heart spirit said scrooge with an interest that he had never felt before tell me if tiny tim will live in the future i see an empty chair by the fire with a crutch beside it if these shadows do not change the child will die no no said scrooge oh no kind spirit say that he will live if his life does not change soon he will die before next christmas what does that matter there are too many people in the world so it s a good thing if some of them die scrooge was ashamed and sad to hear his own words spoken by the spirit but he lifted his head when he heard his name mr scrooge said bob let s drink to mr scrooge whose money has paid for this meal his money said mrs cratchit angrily what can we buy with his fifteen shillings a week why should we drink to the health of a hateful hard unfeeling mean old man like scrooge my dear said bob gently remember it s christmas well bob i ll drink to his health only because of you and because it s christmas long life to mr scrooge a merry christmas and a happy new year to him he ll be very merry and very happy i m sure when the children heard scrooge s name a dark shadow came over their happiness for a while and they were quiet and a little sad but five minutes later they were talking and laughing and telling stories ten times merrier than before they were not a good looking or a well dressed family but they were happy and grateful and loved each other as they disappeared in the light of the spirit s torch scrooge could not take his eyes off them especially tiny tim by this time it was getting dark and snowing heavily the spirit took scrooge into many houses where fires were burning cheerfully and food was cooking and people were merrily welcoming their friends and families into their homes the ghost was delighted to see all this excitement and made sure that he lifted his torch over every poor family to give them more fun and better food and greater happiness then the spirit took scrooge away from the busy capital to a wild lonely place in the country where no trees grew here they visited a small stone house a long way from any town or village where an old man and woman were singing christmas carols with their children and grandchildren the spirit did not stay long here but told scrooge to hold his robe again where are we going not up in the air surely and scrooge terribly frightened looked down as they flew over the land and then over the sea it was stormy windy weather and the waves crashed violently underneath them the spirit took scrooge to a lighthouse built on a lonely rock several miles from land a light was kept burning at the top in order to warn sailors to keep away from the dangerous rocks two men lived here in this cold unfriendly place far away from their families but the spirit smiled to see them shake hands wish each other a merry christmas and sing a carol together in front of their fire again the spirit and scrooge flew on and together they landed on a ship in the middle of the sea here every man although many miles from home had a kind word for his friend or thought warmly of his family because it was christmas it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the noise of the wind and waves to hear a happy laugh he recognized it as his nephew s and found himself with the smiling spirit beside him in his nephew s bright warm sitting room when scrooge s nephew laughed everybody who was with him wanted to laugh too he had that kind of laugh and at the moment his very pretty wife and several of his friends were laughing with him he said that christmas was humbug ha ha ha cried scrooge s nephew that s very bad of him fred said his wife he s a strange old man said scrooge s nephew but i m sorry for him his money is no use to him you see he isn t at all happy or comfortable although he s rich it s sad to think of him sitting alone in his cold room and so i m going to invite him every christmas he can be cross and miserable if be likes but i ll go on inviting him and one day perhaps he ll think better of christmas after tea the cheerful little group sang songs and played music scrooge recognized the song that his little sister used to sing and remembered sadly what the ghost of christmas past had shown him later the friends played guessing games and scrooge joined in the games with delight nobody except the spirit could hear him but he often guessed the right answer it s time to go now said the ghost smiling at the old man s childish excitement no spirit please let me stay a little longer look they re playing a new game it was a game called yes and no in which scrooge s nephew had to think of something and the others had to ask questions to discover what it was the only possible answers were yes or no scrooge heard that fred was thinking of a living animal a wild animal sometimes an angry animal which lived in london and walked in the streets every time he answered a question fred could not stop himself laughing at last his wife s dark pretty sister started laughing too i know what it is fred i know she cried out it s your uncle scro o o o oge everyone laughed until they cried what a wonderful game what a clever idea of fred s but at last fred dried his eyes and said we ve been very merry because of him so i think we should drink to his health here s to uncle scrooge a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man uncle scrooge to uncle scrooge they all cried cheerfully lifting their glasses uncle scrooge wanted to thank them but the spirit hurried him away the ghost seemed much older now his brown hair had become grey are spirits lives so short asked scrooge my life in this world ends at midnight tonight listen it s a quarter to midnight now the church clock was striking the three quarters excuse me for asking spirit said scrooge but what are those strange things near your foot oh man look here said the spirit sadly and brought out from under his robe two ghostly figures a boy and a girl they were thin and poorly dressed with cold mean eyes and dry yellow skin and their faces showed only a frightening and murderous hate scrooge had never seen anything so terrible or so sad these miserable children are man s said the spirit the boy is crime the girl is need they will destroy man if nothing is done about them can t anyone help them cried scrooge are there no prisons said the spirit turning on scrooge for the last time with his own words are there on workhouses the clock struck twelve scrooge looked but could no longer see the ghost or the children he was alone again the last of the spirits the third spirit will come at midnight scrooge suddenly remembered the words of jacob marley s ghost and lifting his eyes saw a spirit all in black coming slowly towards him it was a tall silent figure wearing a long black robe which hid its head and body when it came close to him it stopped and pointed onwards with one hand scrooge was more afraid of this spirit than he had been of the others and his voice was shaking as he asked are you the spirit of christmas yet to come the ghost neither spoke nor moved but still pointed onwards are you going to show me shadows of the things which haven t happened yet but will happen in the future scrooge asked there was no answer ghost of the future he continued you frighten me very much but i think you can help me to change my life i ll be very grateful to you if you show me the future won t you speak to me again no reply well show me the way spirit said scrooge finally the night is passing and time is valuable to me i know the ghost moved away with scrooge following in its shadow suddenly they were in the heart of the capital among the businessmen and moneylenders the ghost pointed to one small group of men so scrooge went closer to listen to their conversation no i don t know much about it said one fat man i only know he s dead when did he die asked another man last night i think why what was the matter with him asked a third i ve no idea replied the fat man looking bored who cares what s he done with his money asked a red faced gentleman i haven t heard said the fat man he hasn t left it to me that s all i know they all laughed at this scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit hoping it would explain what the conversation meant but the ghost moved on pointing at two more men scrooge listened again he knew these men well they were rich and important and he had often done business with them how are you said one how are you replied the other well said the first the old man has died at last has he so they tell me replied the second cold isn t it nice and frosty for christmas good morning not another word that was the end of their meeting scrooge wondered why the spirit wanted him to hear these conversations what could they mean the dead man could not be his partner jacob because he was already dead scrooge watched carefully trying to understand he looked round for his own shadow but could not see himself anywhere perhaps that s not surprising he thought because if i change my life and i m planning to do that i won t be the same person in the future just then he noticed the spirit standing quiet and dark beside him with its pointing hand he felt the unseen eyes staring fixedly at him behind the black robe scrooge s body shook and he felt cold they left the busy offices and banks and went to another part of the capital where scrooge had never been before the streets were narrow and dirty the houses miserably poor the people unwashed and half dressed down one street there was a small shop where an old man was sitting waiting for customers his business was buying old furniture or clothes and selling them again to the poorest people in london as scrooge and the spirit watched three women arrived at the shop door at the same time each carrying a large bundle they looked very surprised and a little ashamed to see each other suddenly they all started laughing ladies you couldn t find a better place to meet said joe the old man getting up now come inside and show me what you ve got to sell inside the first woman put her bundle on the table and said i don t care if everybody knows where this comes from we all have to take care of ourselves he always did that s right agreed the second woman very true agreed the third does a dead man need these things continued the first woman and why was he so mean while he was alive we all worked for him didn t we cleaned his house washed his clothes cooked his soup and what did we get three shillings a week it s no surprise that he died alone with no friends around him you never spoke a truer word said the second he was a bad man we all know that said the third now what have we here said old joe opening the women s bundles buttons pencils boots silver spoons some excellent bed curtains blankets and a very good shirt he added feeling the fine cotton yes it was his best said the first woman they put it on him after he died but he doesn t need it now that he s dead and the blankets and bed curtains he doesn t need them either you took the shirt off a dead body and the blankets and curtains off his bed while he was lying there well well said joe shaking his head here s your money and he counted out several shillings into the women s hands ha ha ha laughed the first woman he frightened everyone away when he was alive and we ve made money out of him now that he s dead ha ha ha scrooge felt sick and angry at the same time spirit he said i see now i could be that unhappy man good heavens what s this joe and the women had disappeared and scrooge was standing in a dark room opposite him was a bed with no blankets or curtains a light shone down from above on to the body of a dead man covered with a sheet how sad thought scrooge to die with no friends or family around him to lie in an empty room with no candles or flowers and robbed of his clothes to know that nobody loves him because he loved nobody in his life money can t buy a happy life or a peaceful death he looked at the spirit whose hand was pointing at the man s covered head it would be easy to lift the sheet and see who the man was but for some reason scrooge could not do it spirit he said this is a terrible place let s go still the ghost s unmoving finger pointed at the man s head i understand you but i can t look at him spirit i can t said scrooge wildly if there s anyone in this town who feels anything at this man s death show that person to me spirit please for a moment the spirit lifted its dark robe like a wing and showed scrooge a room where a mother and her children were sitting the young woman kept looking at the clock and when her husband arrived she hurried to meet him what what is the news she asked him worriedly is it good or or bad there is still hope caroline he replied how can there be hope if that hard mean old man wants us to pay back the money now they ll send us to prison we haven t got enough to pay him he is dead caroline answered her husband thank god for that cried the young woman from her heart the next moment she realized what she had said oh i didn t mean that i m sorry if anyone dies perhaps the person who inherits his business will give us more time to pay the money back and we ll have the money by then tonight we can sleep well caroline so spirit said scrooge in a broken voice you can show me only happiness at this man s death it frightens me spirit show me please that there can be sadness at a death the ghost took him silently through the streets to poor bob cratchit s house the room seemed strangely quiet the mother and her daughters were making a small white cotton shirt together while the usually noisy young cratchits sat silently in a corner and peter was reading a book mrs cratchit put her work down on the table and covered her face with her hand the colour hurts my eyes she said the colour ah poor tiny tim they re a little better now she went on it s difficult to work by candlelight and i don t want to show red eyes to your father when he comes home he s a bit late said peter but i think he s walked more slowly these last few days mother they were very quiet again at last she said bravely i ve known him walk with with tiny tim in his arms very fast indeed so have i cried peter often but he was very light to carry and your father loved him so much and there s your father at the door now she got up quickly to kiss bob as he came in he looked tired and thin and needed his long scarf poor man martha took his boots and scarf off and belinda brought him his tea and the little cratchits sat close to him he was very cheerful with all of them and was pleased with the little shirt that his wife and daughters were making it ll be ready long before sunday won t it he said sunday you went there today then bob asked his wife yes my dear you d love to see it it s a beautiful green place but you ll see it often i promised him that we would go there every sunday my little little child cried bob hiding his face in his hands he had loved the boy very much he went upstairs to the quiet bedroom where the chlid lay poor bob sat down beside him and when he felt calmer he kissed the little face and went downstairs again almost happy my dears he said to his children one of these days some of you will marry and leave home in a few year s time perhaps all of you will but i m sure none of us will ever forget tiny tim will we never father they all cried and i know said bob that when we remember how patient and gentle he was although he was only a little child we won t argue among ourselves we ll remember poor tiny tim and love each other we will father they all cried again i am very happy said bob i am very happy mrs cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young cratchits kissed him and he and peter shook hands tiny tim your goodness lives on in your family spirit said scrooge i know that you will leave me soon tell me who that dead man on the bed was no answer came in words but the ghost of christmas yet to come took scrooge through the streets of london again wait a moment said scrooge we re passing my office let me see how i shall look in the future the spirit stopped its hand was pointing away from the office but scrooge hurried up to the window and looked in it was an office still but not his the furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself the ghost continued to point onwards and scrooge followed they reached a church and entered the churchyard here among the untidy graves and the uncut grass lay the miserable man whose name scrooge would soon learn it was a lonely place most suitable for a man so unloved the spirit stood and pointed down at one of the graves scrooge was strangely afraid before i look more closely at that gravestone he said answer me one question are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they only shadows of the things that may be without replying the ghost pointed silently down at the grave scrooge moved slowly towards it and following the finger read on the stone his own name ebenezer scrooge am i that man who was lying on the bed he cried the spirit pointed from the grave to him and back again no spirit oh no no the finger was still there scrooge fell to the ground in front of the ghost holding its long dark robe spirit listen i am a changed man i have learnt my lesson from you spirits why show me this terrible end if there is no hope for me for the first time the hand appeared to shake good spirit tell me that my future will change if i change my life now the kind hand shook again i will remember the past and think of the future i will be good to other people i will keep christmas in my heart and will try to be kind ad cheerful and merry every day oh tell me i can clean away the writing on this stone wildly he caught the ghostly hand and held it for a moment but the spirit was stronger than him and pulled its hand away just then scrooge noticed that something strange was happening to the spirit it was getting smaller and smaller and suddenly it became a bedpost the end of the story yes and the bedpost was his own the bed was his own the room was his own best and happiest of all the future was his own to change his life in i will remember the past and think of the future repeated scrooge as he jumped out of bed god bless you jacob marley and god bless christmas in his excitement he found it difficult to speak his face was still wet from crying here are my bed curtains he cried delightedly they aren t stolen and i m alive those were only shadows of things that may be the future will be different i know it will all this time his hands were busy hurriedly putting on his clothes he put his left foot in his right shoe couldn t find the buttons on his shirt and forgot to brush his hair i don t know what i m doing said scrooge laughing and crying at the same time a merry christmas to everybody a happy new year to all the world hurrah there s the door which jacob s ghost came through there s the corner where the ghost of christmas present sat there s the window where i saw the travelling ghosts it s all true it all happened ha ha ha really for a man who hadn t laughed for so many years it was an excellent laugh the father of a long line of excellent laughs i don t know what day of the month it is said scrooge i don t know how long i ve been with the spirits i don t know anything i m just like a baby never mind i prefer being a baby hurrah just then he heard the church bells ring out louder than he had ever heard before running to the window he opened it and looked out no fog at all a clear bright cold day golden sunlight blue sky sweet clean air merry bells oh wonderful wonderful what s today he cried calling down to a boy in the street today replied the boy in great surprise why it s christmas day so i haven t missed it thought scrooge the spirits have done it all in one night he called down to the boy again hallo young man do you know the meat shop at the corner of the next street of course i do replied the boy what an intelligent boy said scrooge do you know if they ve sold the big turkey that was in the shop window yesterday what the one as big as me asked the boy what a delightful boy said scrooge it s wonderful talking to him yes that s the one it s still there in the window said the boy is it said scrooge well go and buy it you don t mean it cried the by i do i do i m serious go and buy it and tell the man to bring it back here come back with the man and i ll give you a shilling come back in less than five minutes and i ll give you three shillings the by went off like a bullet from a gun i ll send the turkey to bob cratchit s laughed scrooge he ll never know who s sent it it s twice as big as tiny tim ha ha ha he went on laughing as he wrote bob s address gave it to the man with the turkey and paid for a taxi because the turkey was much too heavy to carry all the way to camden town now he finished dressing and went out into the streets wearing his best clothes the town was full of happy busy people and scrooge smiled at all of them three or four men said cheerfully to him good morning sir and a merry christmas to you scrooge thought these were the best sounds that he had ever heard as he was walking he suddenly noticed one of the comfortable looking gentlemen who had come to his office to ask for money for the poor scrooge went straight up to him took the old gentleman by both hands and said my dear sir how are you a merry christmas to you sir mr scrooge asked the gentleman surprised yes that s my name i m very sorry for what i said to you when you visited me yesterday will you please and he spoke very quietly in the gentleman s ear good heavens cried the gentleman my dear mr scrooge are you serious i am not a shilling less i must tell you i haven t given anything to anyone for years my dear sir said the gentleman shaking hands with him i don t know how to thank you for don t say anything please replied scrooge will you come and see me tomorrow about it i will cried the old gentleman happily thank you and god bless you said scrooge he went to church and watched the people and gave children money for sweets and discovered that he had never been so happy in his life in the afternoon he went to his nephew s house he passed the door several times before he was brave enough to knock but at last he did it and was taken into the sitting room where fred and his pretty wife were waiting for their friends to arrive for dinner fred said scrooge it s your uncle scrooge i ve come to dinner will you let me stay fred let him stay fred almost shook his uncle s arm off scrooge felt at home in five minutes nothing could be merrier and what a wonderful dinner they had wonderful party wonderful games wonderful happiness but he was early at the office next morning oh he was there early he wanted to catch bob cratchit arriving late and he did the clock struck nine no bob a quarter past no bob he was eighteen and a half minutes late when he finally hurried in scrooge was sitting with his office door open hallo said scrooge in his old hard voice what do you mean by coming here so late i m very sorry sir said bob i am late it s only once a year we were rather merry yesterday sir now i ll tell you what my friend said scrooge i m not going to have this any longer and so he continued jumping off his chair and shaking bob s hand i m going to pay you twice as much bob s face went white for a second or two he thought that scrooge had gone crazy a merry christmas bob said scrooge and it was clear that he meant it a merrier christmas bob than i ve given you for a long time i m going to pay you well and help you with your family and we ll discuss it all this afternoon over a christmas drink bob put more wood on the fire at once bob cratchit and let s be comfortable scrooge did everything that he had promised and more to tiny tim who did not die he became a second father he became as good a friend employer and man as anyone in london or in the world some people laughed to see the change in him but he did not care his own heart laughed inside him and that was good enough for him he never had any more conversations with spirits but kept christmas cheerfully and lived a happy life that is what all of us want and so as tiny tim said god bless us every one txtba www txtba com the river the mole worked very hard all morning cleaning his little home he brushed and he washed he cleaned the floors and the walls he stood on chairs to wash the tops of cup boards he got under the beds he took up the carpets he cleaned and he cleaned until his arms and his back ached with tiredness it was springtime and the smell and the sound of spring were everywhere even in the mole s dark little house under the ground and with the spring comes the promise of change of sunshine of new green leaves so it was not surprising that the mole suddenly put down his brushes and said oh bother and then i m tired of cleaning something up above the ground was calling to him and he ran out of his house and began to dig his way upwards to the sun he dug and he pushed and he pushed and he dug up we go up we go he said to himself until at last his nose came out into the sunlight and he found himself in the warm grass of a field this is fine said the mole this is better than cleaning the sunshine was warm on his back and the air was filled with the songs of birds he gave a little jump for happiness shook himself and then began to cross the field towards some trees here and there he went through the fields and the woods looking and smelling and listening everywhere animals and birds were busy talking and laughing looking for food making new homes for the spring the mole enjoyed it all then suddenly he came to a river he had never seen a river before in his life this wonderful bright shining thing which danced its way in and out of the shadows under the trees it was never still for a minute hurrying and laughing and talking to itself and at once the mole was in love with it he walked along the river bank listening and watching all the time at last he sat down on the grass and looked across the river to the bank opposite there was a dark hole in the bank and the mole watched it dreamily thinking that it would be very pleasant to have a little house by the river as he watched he saw some thing shining in the hole soon he saw that it was an eye and then a face appeared as well a brown little face with whiskers with bright eyes and small ears and thick shiny hair it was the water rat then the two animals stood up and looked at each other hello mole said the water rat hello rat said the mole would you like to come over asked the rat oh it s easy to talk said the mole a little crossly the river was new to him and he did not know how to get to the other side the rat said nothing and disappeared then he appeared again in a little blue and white boat which came quickly across the river towards the mole it stopped by the bank and a moment later the mole to his great surprise and excitement found himself actually sitting in a real boat do you know he said as the rat began to row away from the bank i ve never been in a boat before in all my life what cried the rat my dear fellow you haven t lived believe me he went on seriously there is nothing really nothing nicer than just messing about in boats you can go up river down river stay where you are it really doesn t matter there s always something to do but you don t have to do it if you don t want to you can do what you like look here if you re not busy today why don t we spend the day on the river together the mole had listened to all this with great interest now he sat back in the comfortable seat and said what a wonderful day this is let s start at once but first the rat went into his hole and after a while came out carrying a very large and heavy lunch basket this went in to the boat under the mole s feet and then the rat began to row down river the two friends talked from time to time but mostly the mole just watched the river dreamily enjoying the sounds and the smells and the sunlight at last they turned off the big river into a little side river that came down to join it the rat stopped the boat and they got out on to a bank of soft green grass under tall willow trees it was very quiet and very peaceful the mole sat down and looked around him what a beautiful place he said happily time for lunch said the rat opening the basket come on mole let s get to work the mole was happy to obey because he was very hungry indeed after all his cleaning earlier in the day and what a lunch it was there were cold meats and egg sandwiches cooked chicken and tomatoes apples and bananas and a large cake when at last they could eat no more the mole lay back and watched the river lazily after a while he sat up i can see a long line of bubbles in the water he said i wonder what it is bubbles oho said the rat and he called out across the river in a friendly kind of way the bubbles stopped and turned soon a wet whiskery nose appeared above the edge of the bank and the otter pulled him self out and shook the water from his coat a lunch party he said going straight towards the food why didn t you invite me ratty we didn t plan it explained the rat we only decided to come this morning oh and this is my friend mr mole happy to meet you said the otter and the two animals were friends at once all the world seems to be out on the river today said the otter while he ate i came up this side river to try and get a moment s peace and then i find you fellows having a lunch party suddenly there was a noise in the thick bushes behind them and a big black and white head looked out at them come on old badger shouted the rat the badger came forward a few steps then stopped hmm a crowd he said crossly and turned his back and disappeared again into the bushes what a pity said the rat dear old badger he s a good fellow but he does hate a crowd we won t see him again today but tell us who s out on the river toad s out for one replied the otter in his shiny new boat he s got new boating clothes and everything the rat and the otter looked at each other and laughed toad s always trying something new the rat explained to the mole but he always gets bored so quickly last year it was a house boat and he wanted to spend the rest of his life living on the river this year it s rowing boats he s a nice fellow of course said the otter but he never learns from his mistakes from where they sat they could see a bit of the big river and just then they saw a rowing boat going past and in it a short fat animal rowing very hard and very badly there s toad going past now said the rat look at him he ll turn that boat over in a minute of course he will laughed the otter toad had now disappeared up river and the otter went on did i ever tell you that story about toad and the there was a sudden movement in the water near the bank something silvery shone for a second then it was gone and so was the otter the mole looked down the otter s voice was still in his ears but the otter had disappeared there was just a long line of bubbles in the river the rat sang a little song to himself and the mole remembered that it was not at all polite in the animal world to say anything if your friends disappeared at any moment for any reason well well said the rat i suppose we should think about getting home the mole packed the things away in the lunch basket and soon the rat began to row gently homewards while the after noon sun went down behind the trees the rat was dreaming quietly to himself but the mole was very full of lunch and the excitements of the day he began to think that he knew every thing about boats now and in a while he said ratty pleas i want to row the rat shook his head with a smile not yet my young friend he said wait until you ve had a few lessons it s not as easy as it looks the mole was quiet for a minute or two but he wanted to row very much indeed he was sure that he could row as well as rat then before the rat could stop him he jumped up and pulled the oars out of the surprised rat s hands the rat fell backwards off his seat calling out stop it you silly fellow you ll have us in the river the mole made a great dig at the water with the oars but the oars never touched the water at all the mole s legs flew up above his head and he found himself lying on top of the rat in the bottom of the boat frightened he tried to get up got hold of the side of the boat and the next moment splash over went the boat and the mole and the rat and the lunch basket were all in the water it was the rat of course who pulled the mole out of the water who turned the boat right way up who found the oars who got the lunch basket from the bottom of the river and he laughed and laughed when all was ready again the unhappy mole sat in the boat very wet and very miserable as they left he said in a low voice ratty my dear friend i have been so silly and so ungrateful i really am very sorry indeed that s all right replied the rat kindly i m always in and out of the water myself so don t worry about it but i re ally think you should come and stay with me for a while you ll be very comfortable and i ll teach you to row and to swim soon you ll be as good a boatman as any of us the mole was almost too happy to speak and could find no words to thank his friend when they got home they had a good hot supper in front of a bright fire while the rat told exciting stories of life on the river then he took the mole upstairs to the best bedroom and soon the mole was lying warm and comfortable listening to the sound of his new friend the river running past his bedroom window that was the first of many wonderful days for the mole as the spring turned slowly into a golden summer he learnt to swim and to row and he learnt to love the sound of the wind when it went whispering its secrets through the trees and the plants by the river the open road one bright summer morning the mole and the rat were out on the river bank watching the world go by the rat was writing a song and was singing quietly to himself as he tried different words ratty said the mole could i ask you something mmm the rat said not really listening sky fly high die why oh dear what did you say mole will you take me to visit mr toad i ve heard so much about him and i do want to meet him why of course said the rat kindly get the boat out and we ll row up there now toad s always happy to see his friends he must be a very nice animal said the mole as he got into the boat and took the oars he s the best of animals replied the rat kind friendly not very clever perhaps and sometimes he s just a little bit boastful but he s a good fellow really the mole rowed hard up the river and in a while they came to a large red house with beautiful gardens reaching down to the water s edge there s toad hall said the rat it s a lovely old house toad is very rich you know and this is really one of the nicest houses on the river but we never say that to toad of course they left their boat by the boathouse at the end of the gar den the boathouse was full of expensive boats which looked new and mostly unused the rat looked around him i see that all the boats are out of the water he said i suppose toad has finished with boating now and has some new interest to amuse him they walked over the grass towards the house and soon found toad resting in a garden chair and carefully studying a large map wonderful he cried as he saw them you re just the fellow that i wanted to see ratty he jumped up and came towards them talking all the time and gave the rat no time to introduce the mole i need you very much both of you you ve got to help me it s most important it s about your rowing i suppose said the rat keeping his face very serious you will learn to do it in the end you know if you re patient and work hard and oh bother boats the toad said crossly i ve finished with boats silly way to pass the time no i ve discovered the real thing the best way the only way to spend one s life come with me dear ratty and your kind friend too and i will show you he took them round to the other side of the house and there they saw a shiny new gipsy caravan it had yellow and green sides and red wheels there you are cried the toad there s real life for you the open road the fields the hills villages towns cities here today off to a different place tomorrow travel change interest the world in front of you the mole was very interested and excited and followed the toad inside the caravan to look around but the rat shook his head and waited outside when they came down the steps again the toad was still talking excitedly to the mole so you see everything is ready for when we start this afternoon what was that said the rat slowly did you say we and start and this afternoon now dear good old ratty said toad quickly don t talk in that cross voice you know you ve got to come you can t stay by your boring old river all your life i want to show you the world i don t care said the rat calmly i m not coming and that s final i m going to stay by my old river and what s more mole s going to stay with me aren t you mole of course i am said the mole bravely but his face looked sad poor mole he thought that life in a caravan on the open road would be an exciting adventure the rat saw his sad face and felt worried he liked his friends to be happy and he could see that the mole really wanted to go toad watched them both carefully come in and have some lunch he said pleasantly and we ll talk it over during lunch which was excellent of course because everything at toad hall always was the toad talked and talked he was full of wonderful plans how interesting each day would be what adventures the three friends would have together ah the happiness of the travelling life in the end of course the rat agreed to go and by the evening they found themselves on a lonely hillside miles from home it had been a golden afternoon and even the rat had enjoyed the journey so far only the old grey horse was not very happy he had to do all the hard work of pulling the caravan and he was not at all pleased about it the next morning the toad was still sleeping deeply when the other two got up they shook him very hard but couldn t wake him so they had to do all the work the rat took care of the horse lit the fire and did last night s washing up the mole walked to the nearest village a long way away to get milk and eggs and bread which the toad had of course for gotten to bring and when at last the toad got up he said what a pleasant easy life it was on the open road the day passed happily as they travelled over green hills and along narrow country roads but the next morning the rat and the mole got toad out of bed and made sure that he did some of the work because of this toad said very little about a pleas ant easy life later he even tried to get back into bed but the mole and the rat pulled him out again the end of their journey came very suddenly in the after noon they were travelling along a big road the mole was walking beside the horse and the toad and the water rat were walking behind the caravan talking together actually the toad was talking and the rat was listening some of the time then they heard a noise behind them and looking back they saw a small cloud of dust it made a poop poop sound and it was coming towards them very fast indeed seconds later the peace of the afternoon was destroyed in a storm of noise and wind and dust the poop poop rang with a shout in their ears and an enormous long shining motorcar roared past them and disappeared over the hill the old grey horse wild with fear tried to get off the road the caravan s wheels began to go down into the ditch along the edge then there was a terrible crash and the beautiful yellow and green caravan lay helplessly on its side the rat jumped up and down in the road shouting angrily stupid dangerous people the police should lock you up in prison he and the mole managed to calm the horse and then they went to look at the caravan two wheels had come off the windows were broken and bits of wood lay everywhere they tried to pull it out of the ditch but they couldn t move it hi toad they cried come and help us can t you the toad never answered a word so they went to see what was the matter with him they found him sitting in the middle of the road with a dreamy smile on his face and happily whispering poop poop the rat shook him not very gently are you coming to help us toad he asked crossly oh what happiness whispered toad to himself the real way to travel the only way to travel here one minute miles away in seconds wonderful poop poop oh do stop being so silly toad cried the mole and i never knew the toad went on dreamily i never dreamt what clouds of dust will fly up behind me as i drive like the wind i ve finished with silly old caravans for ever poop poop what are we going to do with him the mole asked the water rat nothing replied the rat there s nothing that we can do i know toad when he gets a new idea into his head he al ways goes crazy at first he ll be like this for some days now come on we ll have to do everything by ourselves they had to leave the caravan in the ditch and walk to the nearest town five or six miles away there they asked some body to take care of the horse and found somebody who agreed to fetch the broken caravan then they caught a train to a station near toad hall took toad home went down to the boat and then at last they sat down to a late supper in rat s comfortable little home by the river the next day was a lazy one in the evening the mole was sitting on the river bank fishing when the rat who had been to visit friends came to find him heard the news the rat said everybody s talking about it all along the river bank toad went up to town by an early train this morning and he has ordered a large and very expensive motor car the wild wood the mole had wanted for a long time to meet the badger he often spoke about his wish to the water rat but the rat didn t seem to want to do anything about it it s all right the rat always said badger will come past one day and then i ll introduce you couldn t you invite him to dinner or something asked the mole he wouldn t come said the rat he hates crowds and parties and dinners and all that kind of thing well then shall we go and visit him oh no the rat said he s very shy and he wouldn t like that at all i know him very well but i ve never visited his home and it s not really possible to go there because he lives right in the middle of the wild wood you said you would tell me about the wild woo said the mole but you never did aren t they aren t they very nice people in there well said the rat the squirrels are all right and the rabbits most of them and badger of course he likes living there and nobody gives him any trouble but who could give trouble asked the mole there are well others the rat went on slowly weasels stoats ferrets and so on they re all right in a way most of the time but well you wouldn t want to turn your back to them in the dark and that s a fact don t worry about badger he ll come along one day but the summer passed and the badger never came along soon the days grew shorter and the cold weather kept the animals inside their comfortable houses the rat slept a lot in the winter going to bed early and getting up late during his short day he wrote songs and did small jobs in the house and of course there were always animals calling in for a comfort able talk round the fire telling stories and remembering the good times and the adventures of the past summer one afternoon while the rat was sleeping peacefully in front of the fire the mole decided to go out by himself and take a walk in the wild wood perhaps he thought i ll meet mr badger and then i can introduce myself it was a cold afternoon with a hard grey sky the mole hurried along enjoying the quietness of the winter day and after a time he saw in front of him the black shape of the wild wood he was not at all frightened at first it was a strange dark place but the mole found that exciting he went deeper and deeper into the wood where the light was less and the trees grew close together everything was very still now and the darkness seemed to come down quickly shutting the mole off from the outside world then the faces began out of the corner of his eye the mole thought that he saw a face looking at him from a hole a little narrow face with hard unfriendly eyes when he turned to look straight at it the thing had disappeared he hurried on telling himself not to be silly he passed an other hole and another and yes eyes were looking at him then disappearing again into the darkness soon every hole had a face which watched him with eyes full of hate the mole felt he had to get away from these faces he turned off the path and hurried into the thickest part of the wood then the whistling began it was soft and far behind him when he first heard it then it seemed to come from in front of him more loudly the mole stopped and listened then went on again he was trying hard to stay calm but his heart was beating very fast he was alone and far from help and the night was coming down quickly then the pattering began at first he thought it was only falling leaves but then the noise grew louder and nearer and the mole knew what it was it was the sound of little feet running behind him in front of him on all sides of him all the wood seemed to be alive running following chasing something or somebody the frightened mole began to run too but he did not know where he ran into trees and bushes he fell over things and into things he picked himself up and ran on at last he found a deep dark hole in the bottom of an old tree and fell into it too tired to run another step he lay there shaking with fear and listened to the whistlings and the patterings outside now he understood why the rat did not want to talk about it and why other small animals from the fields and the river bank never came here be cause now the mole had felt it himself the terror of the wild wood all this time the rat warm and comfortable was sleeping in front of his fire when he woke up he looked round for his friend but the mole was not there he called out moly several times and when he heard no answer he got up and went out into the hall the mole s hat was missing and so were his boots the rat left the house and looked around the ground was soft from rain and he could see clearly which way the mole had gone straight towards the wild wood the rat stood thinking for a moment looking very serious then he went back into the house took a gun and a thick heavy stick and hurried away across the fields inside the wood it was nearly dark and the whistling and the pattering began almost at once but when the faces in the holes saw the rat s gun and his thick heavy stick they disappeared immediately and everything became still and quiet patiently the rat began to search the wood from end to end calling all the time moly moly where are you it s me it s old rat at last to his great happiness he heard a little answering cry and soon he found the mole in his hiding place in the tree oh ratty cried the mole i m so pleased to see you i ve been so frightened i can t tell you i can understand that said the rat kindly you see mole it s really not a good idea to come here alone we river bankers always come in twos or threes if we have to come here of course if you re badger or otter then there s no problem surely the brave mr toad is happy to come here alone isn t he asked the mole old toad said the rat laughing loudly he doesn t put his nose inside the wild wood much too frightened the mole felt a little happier when he heard this but he was still too tired to start the journey home so he lay down to sleep under some dry leaves while the rat sat next to him patiently waiting the mole woke up feeling much better and ready to leave the rat put his head out of the entrance of the hole and then the mole heard him say oh dear oh dear what s the matter ratty asked the mole snow replied the rat it s snowing hard but we can t stay here all night it s too cold and too dangerous we ll just have to start walking and hope the trouble is i don t really know where we are and in the snow everything looks so different it did indeed the white blanket of snow covered everything hiding the paths changing the shapes of the trees and bushes an hour later they were wet cold aching with tiredness and had no idea where they were they sat down for a rest and were moving on again when the mole gave a sudden cry and fell forward on his face oh my leg he cried i ve hit my leg on something really hard let s have a look said the rat sitting down beside him that s a very deep cut he said surprised i wonder what suddenly he got up and began to dig in the snow what are you doing ratty said the mole the rat just went on digging then he found something and immediately began to dance round it excitedly look at this mole he shouted just look at this the mole looked then he looked at his fried it s a doors craper why get excited about a door scraper don t you understand you silly animal cried the rat i understand that somebody s been very careless leaving a door scraper lying in the middle of the wild wood for other people to fall over and when i get home oh dear oh dear cried the rat just stop arguing and dig or do you want to spend all night in the snow the mole did what he was told although he thought his friend was going crazy the two animals dug and dug and after ten minutes hard work they were successful the mole had thought that they were digging into a snow bank but now he saw that there was a door under the snow a green door with a long bell pull beside it and a name on it in big letters which said mr badger the mole fell backwards on the snow in surprise oh rat he cried how clever you are and how stupid i am never mind all that said the rat just get up and pull on that bell while i knock on the door the rat banged on the door with his stick and the mole pulled and from somewhere far under the ground they could just hear the sound of a deep slow bell a meeting with mr badger they waited patiently for a very long time jumping up and down in the snow to keep warm at last they heard feet coming slowly towards the door then the door opened just enough to show a long nose and pair of sleepy eyes and who said a deep angry voice is making visits at this time of night oh badger cried the rat let us in please it s me rat and my friend mole and we re lost in the snow what said the badger in a very different voice my dear ratty lost in the snow and in the wild wood come in at once both of you and get yourselves warm that was a wonderful moment for the mole and the rat when they heard the door close behind them shutting out the wild wood they followed the badger down long dark tunnels until they came into a large kitchen there was a bright fire with comfortable armchairs round it and a great wooden table with long seats this is not the kind of night for small animals to be out the badger said in a fatherly way sit yourselves down by the fire while i get you some supper soon the mole and the rat were warm and dry and the dangers of the wild wood seemed a long way away like a bad dream then supper arrived it was enough for ten small hungry animals and the rat and the mole realized just how hungry they were when at last they could eat no more they sat with the badger round the fire and told him the story of their adventures then the badger said now then tell me the news from your part of the world how s old toad getting on he s going from bad to worse said the rat sadly he had another crash only last week and a bad one you see he thinks he s a wonderful driver the best in the world but he isn t he s terrible but he won t take lessons he won t lis ten to anyone how many has he had the badger asked crashes or motor cars asked the rat well with toad it s the same thing this is the seventh car and the seventh crash his garage is full to the roof with bits of broken motor car he s been in hospital twice the mole added the police have arrested him for dangerous driving three or four times and he s spending so much money that s another problem the rat went on toad s rich we all know that but his money won t last for ever sooner or later one of two things will happen he ll kill himself in a crash or he ll have no money left at all badger we re his friends can t we do something the badger thought for a while you know don t you that i can t do anything now he said at last no no of course not the rat and the mole said together everybody knew that in the animal world the winter was a time for rest and sleep nobody wanted to do anything important or tiring very well continued the badger but when the days are longer and warmer then we ll do something we you and me and our friend the mole here we ll try to teach toad a lesson we won t listen to any silliness we ll bring him back to reason and turn him into a sensible toad at last but now it s time for bed don t hurry tomorrow morning come for breakfast as late as you want the two tired animals slept long and deeply and came down to breakfast very late indeed in the kitchen they found two young hedgehogs busy with bowls of bread and hot milk hello said the rat pleasantly where did you two come from lost your way in the snow i suppose yes sir said one of the hedgehogs politely we got lost on the way to school and mr badger said we could come in and have some breakfast the breakfast things were all ready on the table and the mole and the rat quickly got to work the rat made the coffee while the mole fried several pieces of bread and an enormous number of eggs when the door bell rang one of the hedgehogs went to answer the door he came back followed by the otter who gave a shout of happiness when he saw the rat he ran across the room and almost knocked the rat off his chair get off said the raf with his mouth full of fried bread i thought i d find you here all right said the otter happily everybody along the river bank has been so worried about you rat never came home last night and nor did mole something terrible has happened they said but if anyone s in trouble badger usually gets to hear about it so i came straight here this morning and oh my didn t the wild wood look grand with the snow everywhere and the red sun coming up shining through the black trees halfway here i met one of those silly rabbits he told me that mole had lost his way last night and that they were out and chasing him all over the wood i d like to meet one of them myself this morning and tell them what i think weren t you at all um afraid asked the mole remembering how frightened he had been afraid the otter laughed and showed this strong white teeth i don t think any of them would argue with me here mole be a good fellow and fry me some eggs i m terribly hungry and i ve got a lot to talk about with ratty here haven t seen him for weeks breakfast was almost finished when the badger entered looking sleepy it s nearly time for lunch he said stay and have some with us otter you must be hungry this cold morning the hedgehogs were sent home the breakfast things were cleared away and soon the four animals sat down to lunch together the rat and the otter were having a long conversation about river bank matters so the mole began to talk to the badger this is a wonderful comfortable home you have here he said there s really nothing better than a place underground like this you can shut off the world up there when you don t want it and when you do you can just go up and there s the world waiting for you the badger smiled warmly at him that s just what i say he replied down here you re safe and dry and warm with a house above ground you ve got to worry about fire and wind and rain holes in the roof and broken windows no above ground is fine in its way but one s home should be underground the mole agreed with everything that the badger said his own little home was underground so it was natural for him to feel comfortable there he and the badger became very friendly and after lunch the badger took him all round his home down tunnel after tunnel through room after room the mole was interested in everything and thought it was all wonderful when they got back to the kitchen the rat was walking up and down very restless unlike the mole he didn t really feel comfortable underground he wanted to be back in his own home where the windows looked out over the river and where he could hear the wind whispering through the trees come along mole he said we must get off while it s daylight we don t want to spend another night lost in the wild wood it s all right said the otter i m coming with you and i know all the paths you mustn t worry ratty added the badger calmly my tunnels go further than you think and i ve several back doors at the edge of the wood although i keep them secret from most people so the journey home was really very easy when they came out of the badger s secret back door they found a path across the fields and soon they could see the river in front of them the mole looked back at the wild wood for a moment thinking of the terror that he had felt there then he hurried on after the others happy to be back in the open fields and looking forward to the bright firelight of home a lesson for mr toad winter passed and spring returned to the river bank then came a fine morning in early summer when the world seemed full of sunlight and new green leaves down by the river bank the mole and the water rat were hard at work mending and cleaning boats looking for lost oars and getting ready for a summer on the river then they went in to breakfast and had nearly finished when they heard a heavy knock on the door the mole went to see who it was and came back with a very surprised face mr badger he said this was a wonderful thing indeed for the badger to come and visit them he came into the room and stood looking at them very seriously the rat dropped his egg spoon and sat open mouthed the hour has come said the badger at last what hour asked the rat worriedly looking at the clock on the wall whose hour you mean replied the badger why toad s hour the hour of toad i said i would teach him a lesson when the summer came and i m going to begin today toad s hour of course cried the mole i remember now we ll teach him to be a sensible toad i learnt last night continued the badger that another new and very fast motor car has just arrived at toad hall you two must come with me immediately and we will save toad from this madness right cried the rat jumping up let s go at once when they reached toad hall they saw the new motor car in front of the house it was long shiny and bright red toad s favourite colour then toad himself came down the steps in an enormous overcoat hat and driving goggles hello you fellows toad called come for a drive you re just in time to to he saw his friends serious faces and stopped the badger walked up the steps come inside the house toad he said we have to talk to you the three of them took toad inside and shut the door now the badger said to toad first of all take off those silly driving clothes no i won t replied toad what is the meaning of this explain yourself at once take his things off you two ordered the badger it wasn t easy to do the rat had to sit on toad while the mole pulled off his overcoat hat and goggles and toad called them some very unpleasant names while this was going on but when he stood up again he seemed more like himself the toad that they had always known you knew this would happen one day toad explained the badger we ve warned you so many times and you haven t listened you re spending all your money you re al ways in trouble with the police and you drive like a madman you will come with me into the next room and there you will hear some facts about yourself and you will come out a different toad he took toad into a room off the hall and closed the door the rat shook his head we won t save toad by just talking to him he said he ll say anythingand then just go and do what he likes after about an hour the door opened and a very sad and sorry toad came out followed by the badger my friends said the badger looking pleased i am happy to tell you that toad now realizes how silly he has been he has promised never to get into a motor car again that is very good news said the mole seriously very good indeed the rat said watching toad s face carefully now toad continued the badger i d like you to repeat your promise in front of your friends there was a long long silence no said toad suddenly no i won t i m not sorry and i haven t been silly at all it was all wonderful and i won t promise anything what cried the badger but in there you told me yes yes i know said toad quickly you argue so beautifully dear badger and i can t stop myself agreeing with you but i ve been thinking about it i love driving i m a wonderful driver and i promise you i ll go on driving for ever poop poop i told you so didn t i the rat said to the mole very well said the badger if you won t listen to reason we ll have to try another way we re going to stay with you in your house until you become sensible take him upstairs you two and lock him in his bedroom so toad fighting and shouting was pulled upstairs by his two friends it s for your own good toady you know said the rat kindly we ll all have good times together again soon when this this madness has passed we ll take good care of you toad added the mole no more trouble with the police no more crashes and weeks in hospital then began a very tiring few weeks for the three friends day and night they guarded toad and one of them was always with him they talked to him and tried to amuse him hoping that he would forget his motor car madness but toad did not seem to get better he often put the bed room chairs together to look like a motor car then he sat in the front one and pretended to drive making terrible engine noises all the time his friends tried to interest him in other things but toad just became sad and silent one day the rat was the guard for the morning he went upstairs and found toad still in bed how are you today old fellow he asked brightly a sad whisper came from me bed thank you so much dear ratty but how are you and the excellent mole and dear old badger fine fine replied the rat badger and mole he added perhaps not very sensibly have gone out for a run round they ll be out until lunch time so you and i will spend a pleasant morning together i don t want you to trouble yourself about me toad said in a sad little voice i was wondering if you would go down to the village and fetch the doctor but no it s not important it s probably too late by now are you feeling ill toad what s the matter i don t know i think my heart but you mustn t be sad ratty dear kind friend i have enjoyed knowing you so much hate to say goodbye toad s whisper became slower and slower and then stopped the rat felt very worried toad lay so still and quiet perhaps he really was ill the rat wished that the other two were not so far away what should he do he looked again at the still and silent toad and decided that he must get th doctor at once he hurried out carefully locking the door behind him and ran off to the village as fast as he could when toad heard the front door bang he jumped out of bed laughing loudly he quickly put on his best suit and filled his pockets with money then he took the sheets off the bed tied them together and in minutes he had climbed down from the bedroom window and was running across the garden to wards the fields a few hours later he was a long way from home as he walked happily along the road he felt very pleased with him self a clever piece of work that was he boasted to the trees and the fields poor old ratty a good fellow but not very intelligent badger will be so angry with him soon he came to a small town and decided to have lunch in the pub there he was very hungry after his long walk halfway through his meal he heard a sound that he knew very well indeed poop poop the car stopped outside and the people in it came into the pub to have lunch shaking with excitement toad paid his bill and hurried out he walked slowly round the car looking at it lovingly every body was having lunch and the street was empty i wonder toad said to himself i wonder if this kind of car starts easily it started very easily and toad found himself in the driver s seat he did not know how it happened but a minute later he was driving out of the town forgetting right and wrong for getting everything except this wonderful beautiful madness faster and faster he drove singing and laughing as the car ate up the miles once again he knew that he was toad toad the dreamer toad the adventurer toad the terror of the open road you are a dangerous criminal said the judge you stole a valuable motor car and you drove like a madman it s surprising that you didn t kill somebody and finally you were very rude indeed to the police when they arrested you because of all this i am sending you to prison for twenty years guards take the prisoner away and so shouting and crying toad was taken away he was taken to an old dark castle pushed into the smallest and darkest room below the ground and the door was locked behind him toad s adventures for weeks toad refused to eat he lay on the floor of his prison and cried and cried this is the end of every thing he said miserably i shall never again be a popular and good looking toad a rich and important toad a free and happy toad all my friends will forget even the name of toad but the keeper of the prison had a daughter and she had a very kind heart she often came to visit toad bringing him nice things to eat and hot drinks she asked him questions about his home and his old life and because toad loved to talk about himself it wasn t long before he began to sit up and answer her questions he also realized how hungry he was and so he ate and drank the things that she brought and after a few days of this kindness toad was as loud and boastful as he had always been one morning the girl seemed very serious listen toad she said i have an aunt who is a washerwoman you mustn t worry about it said the toad kindly i have several aunts who ought to be washerwomen don t talk so much toad said the girl now listen i think i have a plan and here she whispered in the toad s ear what cried toad me dress as an old washer woman impossible all right then said the girl crossly you can stay in prison for the next twenty years you ungrateful animal no no said toad quickly you are a good kind clever girl and i am just a stupid toad i shall be very happy indeed to meet your excellent aunt the next evening a little business was done in the toad s prison several gold coins left the toad s pocket and disappeared into the washerwoman s purse soon afterwards toad began to climb up the stairs towards the castle entrance he was wearing an old cotton dress and a black bonnet and carrying a large basket of washing and his heart was beating very fast indeed he passed the guards who called out a friendly good night to him and soon toad was walking through the streets of the town he was free wild with excitement he found his way to the railway station and then came the first problem he had no money to buy a ticket his wallet his keys his watch everything was in the pockets of his coat lying on the prison floor he had to get away from this town as quickly as he could but how could he do it he walked along beside one of the trains until he came to the engine then he stood there crying and looking up at the engine driver hey called the driver what s the matter old lady oh sir said toad i m a poor unhappy washerwoman and i ve lost all my money and i must get home tonight come on then said the engine driver kindly jump up and you can have a free ride but don t tell anyone so far everything was going well for toad the train hurried through the night taking him away from the hateful prison but toad s luck didn t last for long there came a moment when the engine driver put his head out of the window and looked back that s strange he said there s a train behind us coming up very fast i can see it in the moonlight i think they re chasing us i wonder what and then the engine driver gave toad a long hard look so toad had to tell the true story of his crime and his escape the engine driver looked very serious he thought for a bit then said i don t like policemen telling me what to do and i don t like to see an animal crying so cheer up toad this is what we ll do in a mile or two the train goes through a wood i ll slow down there and you ll be able to jump off the train and get away in the dark half an hour later both trains had disappeared into the night and toad was hiding under some dead leaves in the middle of a strange wood there he fell asleep and didn t open his eyes again until early morning he woke up cold and hungry but still free his next adventure was with a barge on a canal he had walked out of the wood and found a road which after a while began to run along the side of a canal toad liked the idea of getting a free ride so when he saw the barge coming along the canal he quickly jumped from the canal bank on to the end of the barge then the barge woman turned and saw him toad was ready with his story i m a poor unhappy washerwoman he began but the barge woman toad quickly discovered was a most unpleasant person she came up to toad and looked hard at his face under his bonnet washerwoman indeed you re a fat lazy little toad that s what you are she said rudely get off my barge and she actually pushed toad off the barge into the canal toad swam to the bank and climbed out he was wildly angry how could he punish this rude and terrible person then he saw the horse which was pulling the barge and an idea came to him two minutes later he was riding the horse across the fields away from the canal behind him the barge woman was shouting and screaming angrily toad rode on laughing at his own great cleverness later that morning he met a man with a caravan who was cooking over a fire in a field toad sold him the barge woman s horse for a good price and a hot breakfast he ate and ate until he was almost too full to move but he still had a long way to go to get home so he got up and went on the sun was shining brightly his clothes were dry again and the new coins made a pleasant sound in his pocket he took off the bonnet which was too hot and began to think about all his adventures and escapes ho ho he said to himself what a clever toad i am how brave how intelligent no problem is too difficult for toad he began to sing a song about himself as he walked along although there was no one to hear it it was perhaps the most boastful song that any animal ever sang if there s a need the world to save then send for mr toad there s none so clever none so brave as famous mr toad there was a lot more of it and it got more and more boastful as it went on he came to a road and began to walk along it hoping for an other free ride after a time he saw a small cloud of dust coming up the road behind him and he heard the noise that beautiful noise of a motor car he stood in the middle of the road and when the car saw him it began to slow down and then a terrible thing happened toad recognized the car and the people in it and what is worse the people recognized toad it s the car thief they shouted the criminal who has escaped from prison stop him catch him toad turned and ran he picked up his skirts and ran faster than he had ever run in his life but the people from the car were now running after him shouting and screaming at him to stop they chased him through a wood across fields up a hill and down into a valley once toad looked back and saw that two policemen had joined the chase he tried to run even faster but he was a fat animal and his legs were short and the people were catching up with him on and on he ran he was now among tall trees and again he looked behind him at that moment the land disappeared beneath his feet and splash he found himself in deep water cold water fast moving water in his terror he had run straight into a river and away the river took him pushing him along first on one side then on the other the cotton dress tied itself round his legs trying to pull him under and toad had to fight to keep his head above water oh my cried poor toad i ll never look at another motorcar for the rest of my life at last he managed to catch hold of some water plants by the river bank he held on too tired to pull himself out of the water then he saw something bright in a dark hole in the bank it moved towards him and became a face brown and small with whiskers it was the water rat return to toad hall the rat got hold of toad s neck pulled him out of the water and took him into his hall oh ratty cried toad i ve done so many wonderful things since i last saw you the dangers that i ve been in i was put in prison escaped of course pushed into a canal swam safely away stole a horsesold it for a lot of money oh i am a clever toad and toad said the water rat very seriously stop boasting go upstairs at once wash yourself and put on some of my clothes i ve never seen anything as wet and dirty as you are toad went upstairs a little crossly but he was pleased to get out of the washerwoman s dress he came down very clean and tidy and ready to tell the rat all about his adventureshow clever how brave how successful he had been the rat gave him lunch and listened unsmiling while toad talked and talked and talked when at last he finished the rat looked up i have to tell you toad he said slowly that i feel ashamedyes ashamed to have a criminal an escaped prisoner for my friend can t you see that none of this is exciting or amusing there was a little silence then toad said sadly you re right ratty of course you are how silly and boastful i have been i shall become a quiet sensible toad from now on in a while i ll walk down to toad hall and walk down to toad hall cried the rat what are you talking about haven t you heard heard what said toad looking frightened quick ratty tell me what haven t i heard about the wild wooders cried the rat the stoats and the weasels and the ferretsthey ve taken toad hall when you were sent to prison they came out of the wild wood one dark night and broke into the hall they ve been living there ever sinceeating your food drinking your drink giving wild parties they ve got guns and knives and sticks and they keep guards round the house night and day they say they re going to stay there for ever at first toad couldn t believe it but he had gone up to toad hall and two ferrets in the garden had laughed at him and the stoats who were guarding the walls had shot at him toad dropped flat in the road and the bullet passed over his head he went back very unhappy to the water rat that night there was a meeting in the rat s house the mole and the badger came to talk about plans to take back toad hall from the wild wooders when they came in and saw toad the badger shook his head sadly poor toad this is not a happy home coming for you but the mole was very pleased to see him here s old toad he cried how did you manage to escape from prison it was very clever of you to do that clever said toad well i don t want to boast mole i ll tell you all about it and you can decide if toad do he quiet please said the rat we need to discuss plans i think i know the best way for toad to no you don t said the mole i know what toad should do he should well i m not going to cried toad getting excited i m not taking orders from you fellows it s my house that we re talking about and by now they were almost shouting at each other when suddenly a deep low voice came from an armchair be quiet at once all of you said the badger and listen the mole and i have been watching toad hall the stoats with their guns are on guard all round the walls and they re very good guards too we can t attack the place from outside they re too strong for us then there s no hope cried toad miserably i shall go and join the army or something and never see my dear toad hall again cheer up toady said the badger because now i m going to tell you a very great secret toad sat up interested he loved secrets although he could never keep them thereisan undergroundtunnel said the badger slowly which goes from the river bank near here right up into the middle of toad hall don t be silly badger cried toad of course there isn t i know toad hall inside and outside and my young friend said the badger calmly your father who was a great friend of minetold me many things that he didn t tell you don t tell my son about this tunnel he said to me he s a good boy but he talks far too much toad opened his mouth to argue and then decided not to i asked otter continued the badger to do some spy work for us he pretended to be a gardener and went to the back door of the hall asking for work during the conversation he learnt that tomorrow night there will be a big birthday par tythe chief weasel s i thinkin the dining hall all the weasels will be there eating and drinking and laughing and making a lot of noise but the stoats will still be on guard on the walls said the rat true agreed the badger but the weasels you see know that so they won t have any guns or sticks with them at the party and the tunnel comes up into that little room right next to the dining hall we only have to run into the dining hall cried the mole with our guns and sticks and knives shouted the rat and chase them and beat them and hit them cried the toad greatly excited he ran round and round the room jumping over the chairs very well then said the badger sitting back comfortably and opening his newspaper that is the plan and there s nothing more for you to argue about all the next day the rat hurried about getting the guns and the knives and the sticks ready once the badger lifted his head from the newspaper we shan t need guns or knives ratty he said we four with our sticks will clear the dining hall in five minutes i could do it by myself better to be safe than sorry said the rat at last the evening came and the four friends went quietly along the river bank to find the entrance to the secret tunnel toad of course managed to fall in the river and his friends had to pull him out the tunnel was cold and wet and dark and narrow poor toad got frightened and ran into the rat by mistake who then nearly knocked the mole over all this made a lot of noise and the badger who was in front with the lantern turned round if toad can t keep quiet he whispered angrily i ll leave him here alone in the dark after that the toad kept very quiet they could hear the noise of the party while they were still underground silently they pushed open the door in the roof of the tunnel and climbed up into the small room next to the dining hall now they could hear one of the weasels singing a very rude song about toad the car thief just wait until i get my hands on him toad whispered angrily showing his teeth right boys said the badger looking round at his friends the hour has come follow me and they crashed through the door into the dining hall what a battle it was how the four friends roared as they ran through the hall what screams of fear came from the surprised weasels and ferrets tables and chairs were knocked over plates and glasses went crashing to the floor up and down went the four friends shouting and roaring and their sticks whistled through the air there were only four of them but they seemed enormous to the weasels and the ferrets the wild wooders ran in terror escaping through the doors and windows and even up the chimneys anywhere to get away from those terrible sticks in five minutes the room was cleared the stoats outside the four friends discovered later had gone too they were already frightened by the noise of battle from the hall so when the weasels and the ferrets started running out in terror the stoats dropped their guns and ran back to the wild wood in fact after that night there was no more trouble from the wild wooders for a long time and when any of them met the badger and his friends out for a walk they were very polite indeed back in toad hall there was a lot of tidying up to do after the battle at last it was all done and the four friends tired but happy went upstairs to bed and now said the badger after breakfast the next morning we must have a victory party toad you must write and invite all our friends for tonight what me do all the work said toad crossly why he suddenly stopped then said yes of course i ll do every thing i ll plan the party and the singing and oh no said the rat you re not going to sing any of your songs not just one little song asked toad miserably no toady you know very well that your songs are all about you and how clever you are they re just one long boast come on now toad said the badger kindly you know that you have to change your ways and become a sensible animal why not begin now what better moment could there be on your return to toad hall toad looked at his three friends serious faces for a long while he seemed to be thinking deeply at last he spoke my friends you are right he said sadly and i am wrong from today i will be a very different toad you will never be ashamed of me again the party was a great success everyone wanted to hear about the battle and there was a lot of noisy talking and laughing but toad was not at all noisy he moved quietly round the room making sure that everyone had enough to eat and drink he said very little about the battle only oh it was badger s clever plan and the mole and the rat did all the hard fighting his three friends watched him with their mouths open in surprise which pleased toad very much towards the end of the evening some of the younger animals started banging on the table and shouting toad song mr toad s song but toad only shook his head gently and immediately began a quiet conversation with otter asking in an interested voice about his children he was indeed a different toad you must marry me nothing ever happens on just like home that s the name of the planet i live on i get so bored but tonight was remembering night and that s exciting there s the big fire where everybody must put on something that they love and watch it burn then there s the dancing round the fire but what i like best about remembering night are the clothes we usually wear what we like on just like home but the clothes must have the name of our name animal on them for example i always have the word hummingbird on my clothes which means my name is hummingbird hummy for short nobody knows what a hummingbird looks like but we know what birds are birds are animals that fly the book of remembering tells us that i don t always believe what the book of remembering says nobody knows who you are on remembering night because you wear black clothes that cover you from head to foot and there is no name of your name animal you can only see people s eyes looking out of the eye holes in the clothes it was dark outside the only light came from the big fire i beld my father s hand at first and we danced together my mother danced away and i couldn t see her soon i lost my father i didn t know where they were it didn t matter i was dancing in the middle of the crowd our family would meet together in the robot plane afterwards there were about a thousand people round the fire too many people to count nearly everybody on just like home was there everybody on planets all over the galaxy was dancing round fires at the same time what a wonderful thing the last dance began you hold hands in a big circle round the fire everybody together you dance round and round in a circle until well everybody knows what happens in the end i was holding hands with someone on my right and someone on my left we were all shouting burn burn burn burn burn burn burn the last dance went on for a long time in the end somebody fell down he pulled down the people on both sides of him then people on both sides of them fell down everybody was too tired to stay on their feet people fell down all round the circle falling dying we wear black clothes to remember we remember the burning we remember that we have a galaxy but we are alone we are empty in our hearts we are the only living things in the galaxy sad lonely and sad i lay on the ground very very tired i was happy and sad at the same time happy to be with everybody sad that we were alone then the worst thing in my life happened somebody came up to me and said hello i didn t know who it was i could only see his eyes shining in the light of the fire but it was the voice of a man who was much older than me hello i answered i didn t want to talk to him i saw you in the dance he said i know you re a young girl because you were dancing like a young girl i think you re seventeen years old no i m only sixteen i said wonderful just what i want said the man i will marry you you must marry me i couldn t believe what he was saying this was terrible and very bad luck yes it was true a woman must marry any man who asks her on remembering night by order of the star council i m sixteen so i m a woman not a child i couldn t say no to this man i was sick in my heart my name s buff the man said what s your name sweetheart er my name s er caterpillar i lied i m usually called kate well kate buff said will you marry me i m sorry buff i know i m sixteen and old enough to get married but my parents don t want me to get married yet i m their only daughter buff laughed it was a horrible iaugh he enjoyed knowing i didn t want him what a monster oh thank earth and animals i hadn t told him my real name i jumped up suddenly and ran into the crowds of people in the dark i was safe he couldn t find me i went to our robot plane and sat inside until my parents came i didn t tell my parents anything i was afraid the star council said buff was right and i was wrong and i didn t know what my parents would do next morning i forgot about it how could buff find me there were hundreds of girls on our planet he didn t know my name he had only seen my eyes suddenly my father came into my room hummingbird he said sadly what s the matter i asked why are you calling me hummingbird not hummy hummingbird ask your robot for a wedding dress why why but i knew the answer you will marry a gentleman called buffalo no father i can t i started crying i don t want to i m too young i don t want to leave you i hate him my father shook his head please hummy it s only for one year you can t be a child forever lots of girls don t want to get married at first the star council says we must get married as often as possible and have children you know why why i spoke like a small child because we are lonely because there is nothing in the galaxy except us you know all that hummy the dressing robot made me a wedding dress we have robots for everything like that the dress was white and covered me all over except for my eyes my father took my arm buff was waiting with my mother i saw his eyes through the eye holes of his wedding suit they were small mean eyes hello kate he said my father said her name is hummingbird i know i know buff said how did you find me i asked buff i had a small camera he answered i took a photo of your eyes did you know that everybody s eyes are different nobody has eyes like yours i turned to my father listen to him can t you see how horrible he is please don t make me marry him my father didn t say anything he couldn t help me you can say no if a man asks you to marry him on remembering night but you must have a very special reason a reason that the star council will accept if you are doing work that is important for the galaxy the council will usually accept that as a good reason i couldn t think of anything like that but it was something to hope for if i could escape i was afraid i didn t want to run away and never see my family again some neighbours arrived and the wedding began immediately buff stood next to me and held my hand his hand was large and a little wet how i hated him my father picked up the book of remembering he read in the beginning there were millions of planets in the galaxy but there was only life on one that was the planet earth people and animals lived together but people polluted earth it became too hot for animals to live they died all the animals died so people left earth and never returned to that planet their hearts were empty when they left earth empty today empty forever buff was still holding my hand my father spoke again buffalo will you take my daughter hummingbird to be your wife for one year in the name of earth and the animals buff answered i will my father turned to me hummingbird will you take this man buffalo to be your husband for one year in the name of earth and the animals that s when i ran i let the wedding dress fall off me i ran fast they ran afterme but i could run much faster without the wedding dress i got to our robot spaceship jumped into it and said take off why are people running towards us the spaceship asked take off now i shouted it s life or death the spaceship couldn t argue it took off just like home was green all over fields of wheat everywhere i was out in space looking back at my planet all around me were stars the millions of stars in the galaxy that s where i could hide a spaceship made of plastic i couldn t believe what i d done i d run away me i m not very brave and i love my parents very much i never thought i could ever disobey them i was afraid and i felt sad for my parents poor mother and father but i had to live my own life i couldn t get married to a horrible old man like buffalo i knew they would follow me quickly so i told the spaceship to take me to a very quiet part of the galaxy a long way from any planets with people on the spaceship went how can a spaceship travel across the galaxy in no time at all well i learnt the answer to that in school there are a lot of little black holes in space they are about as big as a potato a spaceship goes into one black hole and comes out of another black hole on the other side of the galaxy don t ask me how a big thing like a spaceship can go into a thing as small as a potato i was probably asleep when the robot teacher told me the answer to that nobody could find me now i was in the middle of the galaxy in empty space there were stars above my head stars below my feet starson my left hand stars on my right hand strange i knew all these stars were a long long way away but they didn t look far away they looked very close i wanted to reach out my hand and touch them and the silence so very very very quiet the book of remembering says how i felt their hearts were empty my heart was empty i saw millions of stars but there was no life in the galaxy except us humans well there are potatoes and wheat and rice but you can t talk to vegetables we are alone the book of remembering says we did it we polluted earth and so killed all the animals we ran away from earth and we re still running that was twenty thousand years ago and we still can t forget the book of remembering gives names for thousands of animals fantastic could there really be thousands of animals the idea of animals is so strange what did they look like the book of remembering has no pictures but says there are birds that fly and fish that swim there are animals with no legs and animals with lots of legs ugh what a horrible idea can anybody believe stories like that and now i was running away too perhaps i was wrong to run away suddenly the spaceship went ping yes what is it i asked there is something near us oh i said i thought we were a long way from anything out here take me closer we moved closer but i couldn t see anything then one star disappeared then another star and another it was too dark to see what the thing was it was just a big black shape between me and the stars it was probably just a big old rock which had broken off a moon or a planet well perhaps it contained gold or something then i could show the star council i was doing important work perhaps that would be a good reason not to marry buff i said find out what it is made of the spaceship shot a laser at the thing and said it is not natural it may be a spaceship although it is moving too slowly to arrive at a star it is made of plastic a spaceship made of plastic you can t make spaceships out of plastic and spaceships don t travel slowly i was a little afraid but this was something really important nobody could make me get married after i had discovered something as strange as this i was afraid but also excited most girls just get married once a year and have another baby that s enough excitement for them not me i was going to visit this spaceship and meet the people inside it show me this plastic spaceship i said my spaceship shone out light the thing was big big big who would build a spaceship so big the plastic was full of holes and the spaceship looked old and dead would anybody be left alive inside i didn t think so the spaceship was round like a ball it turned slowly which made things inside just heavy enough to stay on the ground i saw a door on it and said land there my spaceship landed i put on a spacesuit went outside and moved to the big round door i pulled and pushed and hit it at last something moved and the door opened inside there was a tunnel a long black tunnel i climbed in and the door closed behind me monsters there was a door at the other end of the tunnel i went through and i was dreaming i saw big things that grew out of the ground they were much taller than me with long brown arms covered with green leaves i was very frightened as i remembered something in the book of remembering in those days there were trees trees i never thought a living thing could be so big i covered my eyes with my hands i was afraid to look but i was afraid not to look after a time i took my hands away from my eyes the trees were still there they weren t moving i suddenly understood that the trees couldn t move they were plants like potatoes or rice i was safe standing under them but i didn t feel safe the computer inside my spacesuit was checking the air for me after a few seconds the red lights on my suit turned to green the air here was safe for humans so i took off my spacesuit now i could touch and smell things there was a soft wind it was cool i smelt strange new smells i smelt living things was i smelling the trees or something else i heard a sound of crying then i thought i heard something moving in the trees just behind one big tree was something hiding behind the tree i was frightened but i wanted to see so i walked slowly towards the tree there was light in this place but there were shadows in the trees i looked round the tree i was frightened almost out of my mind i fell down and my body started shaking a grey thing came out from behind the tree and came towards me it was big but it wasn t tall because it walked on four feet it had no hands but the thing had teeth yes it had a mouth full of teeth yellow shiny teeth it had yellow eyes and grey hair all over its body i could smell it its mouth came towards my face i closed my eyes and waited to die there was hot air on my face i wanted to scream and scream but i was too frightened i couldn t scream my mind exploded i went crazy i suddenly hit the grey thing and it fell back against the tree i hit it again as hard as i could i wanted to destroy the grey thing and i was screaming suddenly it was gone then i saw another monster this one was very small with grey fur all over its body it was holding on to the tree but i pulled it off i could destroy this one i pulled its short legs hard the small monster bit me its teeth went right into my finger the pain was terrible but my mind was exploding i wanted to destroy it and i didn t care about the pain i just wanted to kill it then the big grey monster ran back through the trees jumped at me and knocked me down as i fell i dropped the little monster and it escaped my head banged on a rock and everything went black more monsters there was a long black nose in front of my face it was smelling me at first i couldn t understand what was happening then i remembered the monster with teeth i tried to hit the nose but my arm didn t move something was wrong with me my body felt empty and i was hot inside like a fire my body ached and my skin was wet all over the big grey monster sat in front of me and it looked at me then i saw the small monster too it was lying on the ground it was hurt it was very small just a little bigger than my hand it had a beautiful soft tail and it made a sad sound eee eee i felt two different things at the same time i wanted to destroy it but i also felt sorry for it it was feeling pain like me i didn t know what to do so i started to cry the big monster lay down next to me with its fur against my skin i hated the feeling of its fur but my body couldn t move the fur made my skin dry and i began to feel better i suddenly felt very tired and i was soon asleep i woke up feeling better i wasn t hot inside and i could move again the big monster sat down with me i hit it with my hand but i still wasn t strong i didn t hurt it then the monster opened its mouth and called hoo woo some time passed then more monsters came more and more most of the monsters walked on four legs a very big one licked me with its tongue it was a hard tongue not like my soft tongue but i felt better afterwards that monster made a noise like this hee haw there was a very small monster that could fly it had wings and a long hard mouth it made a noise like this cheepcheep it cleaned my finger where eee eee had bitten me cheepcheep s hard little mouth was good at that i must tell the truth i wanted to take a laser gun and kill all those monsters they weren t hurting me they were helping me they were nice but something in my mind hated them i didn t want to have to think about them but i didn t have a laser gun so i couldn t destroy them one monster brought me water another monster gave me some fruit to eat a few monsters lay against my body and made me warm they helped me in many ways but there was something sick in my mind i still hated them i will try to explain for twenty thousand years the galaxy had belonged to humans everything in the galaxy belonged to us when a new baby comes into a family the first child hates the baby the first child wants to be the most important and to keep everything for itself it is afraid the baby will take things away from it it was like that with me i wanted to fight these monsters i didn t want them living with me in my galaxy one day two humans came through the trees i stood up i was stronger now oh thank earth and animals i said and ran towards them the humans looked at me with big round eyes one human was a man with long hair he said gug gug gug then he went down on the ground on his hands and knees like a baby he ran round me smelling me the woman said yee yee yee she jumped up on a branch of a tree they were humans but they were just like the monsters they couldn t talk to me i started to feel miserable the monsters tried to give me food but i didn t care about eating the monster that said hee haw carried me on its back and we went to a little river hee haw dropped me into the water i didn t care if i was clean or dirty but hee haw kicked water over me and washed me the big grey monster that said hoo woo was worried about me i didn t eat very much and i didn t wash myself i just sat one day hoo woo came with hee haw hee haw carried me through the trees and the three of us travelled a long way finally we came to a high plastic wall hoo woo pushed open a door in the wall and we went through on the other side the air was hot and wet and the trees were bigger there were monsters but they were different hee haw carried me a long way through this forest in the end we arrived at another plastic wall where there was another door hoo woo opened the door and we entered a long tunnel at the end of the tunnel was another door at first hoo woo waited outside this door looking worried i looked at the door what was on the other side why was hoo woo so worried in the end he opened the door i saw a small round room just for a second then a terrible bright light came out after that i couldn t see inside any more it was too bright i was very frightened i felt this fear deep inside me hee haw s head touched the ground hoo woo s head touched the ground too i understood this was their god i understood because i felt the same fear as they did hoo woo pushed me towards the light waiting for fifteen thousand years it s too bright in here i said i can t see the light suddenly wasn t so bright and i could see again i was in a round room which was empty except for a large square computer the computer didn t look like the modern computers we have you are t god i said you re just a computer just a strange old computer a voice came from it yes this is computer who are you oh the computer still worked i was surprised as it looked so very old it didn t speak in a natural way as modern computers do i m hummingbird i answered you are not a hummingbird hummingbirds fly in the forests here in star zoo you are human you are not a child of star zoo computer is happy i listened but i didn t understand hummingbird was just my name and the name of one of the animals in the book of remembering why was this place called the star zoo what was a zoo i had so many questions to ask computer i said where do you come from i never heard of a spaceship as big as this you speak my language but it sounds different why do hee haw and hoo woo think you re god who is hee haw who is hoo woo the computer asked the two monsters that brought me here i answered yes dondey wolf all animals believe computer is god computer makes ultrasonic sound ultrasonics make fear animals i said slowly animals were only a story in the book of remembering there were no animals alive today what was the computer talking about animals like eeeeee and cheep cheep eee eee is a squirrel the computer said cheep cheep is a bird animals take care of you i was very afraid donkey wolf squirrel and bird were all animals named in the book of remembering where did these animals come from i asked star zoo came from earth the computer answered star zoo left earth earth was hot i suddenly couldn t stand i fell down and my mind exploded again this time i wasn t angry i was sad empty afraid and a little crazy this was the book of remembering come to life earth hot that was the burning we made the earth too hot and all life except humans died and we humans did it not necessary to fall down the computer said computer is not god computer wants to talk to humans computer is sad that humans have not spoken for fifteen thousand years i stood up slowly the book of remembering was forremembering the animals but they had been dead for twenty thousand years but the animals were here yes here in the star zoo after travelling between stars for twenty thousand years why did you leave earth what happened i asked the computer answered humans polluted earth earth was hot animals died yes i said i know that the computer continued humans made zoo in space no money used plastic bottles what i said i didn t understand collected old plastic bottles made zoo with plastic bottles cheap made big zoo with many rooms why are there different rooms i asked animals and plants live in different ways the computer said hot cold wet dry impossible to keep all animals and all plants in one room need different things difficult work to get everything right necessary to have big computer no money got old computer from army so that s you i said you re an old army computer from earth computer works and never stops i understand i said a group of people made this star zoo they knew that earth was dying they wanted to save the animals they sent the star zoo away from earth star zoo went the computer said no money went slowly very slowly i agreed but what happened to the humans inside the star zoo five thousand years humans gave orders computer worked computer mended walls computer kept star zoo alive and safe star zoo worked well no problems humans stopped giving orders not necessary to talk humans enjoyed eating playing sleeping computer can do work for fifteen thousand years computer has worked thought learnt grown now you have come computer is happy i was happy too and i wasn t afraid it was wonderful news the galaxy wasn t empty animals could live on all the worlds and all humans could be happy again humans were lonely without animals humans needed animals the animals must leave the star zoo i said to the computer we have planets where they can live do you agree star zoo is not strong the computer said holes in walls lose air and water animals need planets can have more animals on planets then i must go home i said i will come back with spaceships we will take the animals to different planets planets everywhere in the galaxy computer will choose planets for different animals it said first plants will grow animals will follow you can tell us what to do i said this is wonderful i want to leave now is hee haw waiting donkey waits the computer made a noise that was like crying donkey has waited for a few minutes computer has waited for fifteen thousand years you come back computer is sad and afraid they don t believe me where was my spacesuit eee eee found it up in a tree where another squirrel was living in it eee eee told the squirrel to get out of my spacesuit i was happy to wear the spacesuit hoo woo took me to the door where i first came in hoo woo made his noise hoo woo as i opened the door he was sad that i was going i said i m coming back and i went out to my spaceship i got in and said take me home the stars changed suddenly i saw my world in space all green and beautiful a few minutes later the spaceship landed and i was home my father ran from the house shouting hummy i kissed my father my mother was angry with me i didn t know if you were dead or alive she cried it s been a week a week it felt like months to me i ve got some very exciting news for you i said ok my mother said let s sit in the theat and talk there oh yes she said to my father why don t you go to the house and bring us something to drink strange robots usually bring the drinks but i just thought my mother wanted to be specially nice to me i told my mother what had happened when my father came with drinks i told my story anain telling my story i looked at the green fields of wheat moving in the wind the wheat went on for thousands of miles looking just the same everywhere how different it was in the star zoo every time you turned your head you saw something new that had frightened me at first but now i thought the star zoo was wonderful i explained that feeling to my parents yes yes hummy my mother said looking quickly at my father i saw a spaceship land near the house who s coming i asked my mother and father looked at each other then i knew it s buff isn t it i said you called him when you were getting the drinks i said to my father i was really angry how could you wait you don t believe me do you your head is full of dreams hummy my father said you must be married to buff but only for a year then you can get married to someone you like i jumped up i hate you why did i come back why didn t i go straight to the star council buff walked up to us hello again kate he said i still remember the first name you told me i had an idea listen to what happened to me i said and itold my story a third time buff laughed what a story you can tell me stories like that every night so you don t believe me i smiled he just laughed ok buff i said come with me i ll show you the star zoo if it s only a story i ll marry you i ll even get married for five years if you want ok why not buff said i ll bring a robot to see what s really there robots never lie buff borrowed one of our family robots and we took off my father watched us go with a worried face it was black in the empty space far between stars and we couldn t see anything buff was surprised when we landed onthe star zoo we put on spacesuits and went out buff looked at the door very surprised we went in after we went through the second door buff stood without moving and he looked at the trees and didn t say anything the robot closed the door behind us hoo woo ran out of the trees to meet me i was happy to see him and happy to be back in the star zoo again i wasn t afraid at all i looked round at buff and my heart stopped buff s face was full of hate and he was holding a laser gun the gun was pointing at hoo woo the answer is robots ipushed buff as he tried to shoot hoo woo the laser gun burnt a hole in the plastic wall but it didn t hit hoo woo buff was screaming and the whites of his eyes were showing he fell on the ground and water ran out of his mouth he was crazy i remembered the way i had gone crazy when i first came into the star zoo it was seeing the animals it was the book of remembering coming to life it made people go crazy i hid buff s laser gun and used some long plants to tie him up hee haw sat on him while i did it a bell was ringing and all the animals started looking for something what were they looking for a bird found it it was the hole where the laser had burnt through the wall the star zoo was losing air i could hear the air escaping it was the computer s job to check for damage like that then it rang the bell but how could the animals mend the hole eee eee went to a pipe on the wall and waited warm wet plastic came out of the end of the pipe the squirrel held little bits of the plastic and ran quickly up the wall she put the soft plastic over the hole and ran down to get more plastic from the pipe in one minute the hole was covered eee eee went on working until the bell stopped ringing the computer and the animals worked together to mend the star zoo after fifteen thousand years they were very good at it buff had crazy eyes the animals didn t want to go near him so i took care of him i hoped he would get better soon but he didn t get better three days later he still wanted to kill and destroy every animal that he saw he thought i was ananimal too he never spoke perhaps he had forgotten how to speak hewouldn t touch food or water i didn t know what to do in the end i went to see the computer with hee haw and the robot there was the same terrible light and the fear but i knew it was ultrasonics that made me afraid the robot didn t have any feelings of course the robot and i went into the computer room but hee haw stayed outside the ultrasonics stopped and the light went soft hummingbird the computer said you have come back computer is happy who is the other human this isn t a human i explained this is just a family robot not human looks very human i know i said but that s not important everything s gone crazy what is the problem the computer asked i told the computer about visiting my parents and that they didn t believe me i explained about buff and said but he s gone crazy i know i went crazy at first but i got better buff isn t getting better why the computer said you are human buff is human what is different i don t know i answered i m younger than buff perhaps people s minds get hard like rock as they get older they can t change how they think when will buff get better the computer asked never i think i said buff s too old there was silence after a long time the computer said slowly computer is old oh that s different i said i think you are growing very very slowly i think you re still young like me you re still growing and changing not like buff another silence then hummingbird is friend i felt wonderful the computer was twenty thousand years old and it wanted to be friends with me yes i m your friend computer i said i ll be your friend all my life but my life isn t long like yours perhaps my children and grandchildren can be your friends too computer is happy oh computer everything s finished i said i thought buff could learn to accept the animals like me but he can t he can t change how he thinks and i think most people in the galaxy are like him they can t change if they find the star zoo they ll destroy all the animals so it s impossible we can t put the animals on different planets the animals will have to stay in the star zoo one day the star zoo will die after that there will be no life in the galaxy except humans forever the computer said computer will find answer to problem wait i waited and waited i couldn t understand it computers think so fast why wasn t the computer telling me theanswer at last it spoke computer has answer to problem the answer is robots your robot looks very human you will make a robot like an animal humans will know it is a robot not an animal humans will not go crazy humans will learn about animals after some time humans will meet animals humans will not go crazy i think i understand i said people have to spend a long time with robot animals first when they are not afraid they can meet the real animals and accept them yes it s a wonderful idea computer i could kiss you nobody has kissed computer computer is interested so i kissed the computer and i think it kissed me an animal is made arobot can do many different things from taking care of a baby to building a spaceship it can do anything except think the star zoo computer was the only one that could think well our family robot could build a robot animal easily that was no problem first we had to choose what animal to make so we went round the star zoo to look at all the animals hee haw carried me and hoo woo came with us the robot followed i don t know how many rooms the star zoo had i couldn t count them all some rooms were filled with water where there were big fish and small fish there were horrible monsters walking under the water and i felt a little afraid again some rooms were covered in snow and all the animals there had while fur there were dry rooms hot wet rooms forest rooms and animals and birds and trees and flowers there were more living things than i had ever dreamt of i sat on hee haw s back as the donkey walked on we went through a door into a room full of strange life then we went through another door and into another room it was like a dream in a dream things change suddenly without reason it was like that we went back to the computer i didn t know which animal to choose and neither did the robot hee haw and hoo woo didn t understand the problem they weren t intelligent in the human way so i asked the computer watch humans the computer said humans enjoy playing with animals find an animal which enjoys playing with humans so we went to see the humans the humans in the star zoo couldn t speak i sat down and watched them while the humans played up in the trees swam in the pool and played games in the grass they played all the time most other animals didn t play with the humans but finally i saw one animal come through the grass to play it liked playing with humans the humans played with the animal for an hour the animal and the humans enjoyed playing together that s the animal you must make i told the robot the robot watched the animal and touched it and measured everything in the end it was ready to build a robot just like that animal what do you need to build it i asked plastic the robot answered i will use real fur on the outside but i need some metal where can i find metal there was only one thing in the star zoo made of metal the computer the computer told the robot to take off two small pieces of metal from its back the robot worked fast sometimes it needed a special tool then it opened its stomach because the tools were kept inside the body there first the robot made a plastic body which it covered with soft plastic like a skin then it used fur to cover the skin i left before the robot finished because i was worried about buff i didn t want him to die buff still wouldn t eat or drink but the worst thing was he was still crazy his mind wasn t getting better if buff stays in the star zoo i thought he ll die i talked to him but he didn t answer i knew he wanted to kill me he wanted to kill all living things the robot finished its work and showed me a little animal it looked and sounded and played like the real animal i took it to the computer yes it looks just like the animal the computer said it s very small a baby animal the computer told me its name it checked the animal then said to the robot make it warm the little animal was cold so the robot made the baby animal warm like the real animal we were ready the robot put buff to sleep then put the spacesuit on him and carried him to the spaceship i was leaving the star zoo for the second time would our plan succeed i wondered before i went through the door i looked back at all the life that existed only here in the star zoo and in no other place in all the galaxy an animal is destroyed buff was asleep i told the spaceship to take us to new earth the planet of the star council i wasn t going back to my parents i wanted to go to the top people a few minutes later the spaceship was falling towards a planet covered with tall buildings many of the buildings touched the clouds i d never been to new earth before i was just a young girl from a small planet and i felt very unimportant here we landed i could see a lot of people walking quickly they didn t stand and talk they were too busy who was going to stop and talk to a young girl like me everybody was wearing very expensive fashionable clothes too i felt stupid with just my old clothes with my name hummingbird on i said to the robot make a special dress for me i want to look more important a minute later i had the dress it didn t look very good it was grey and just like an old bag i put on the dress and it suddenly came to life it moved over me full of changing colours when i looked in a mirror i couldn t believe it i looked fantastic when i got out of the spaceship i wasn t afraid of anybody at first i thought the star council buildings were the high ones up in the clouds they weren t i had to go below ground to an office where i spoke to a policeman he didn t believe my story about the star zoo until the robot told him it was all true robots can t lie the policeman looked at me for a long time in the end he called a star council official he and the policeman took me to a lift and we went down many floors then they put me in a room and asked me questions they wanted to see the robot animal but i said no i said only the star council could see the robot animal three hours later they were still asking me questions and i couldn t keep my eyes open i was so tired my dress had lost its colours it was just grey again i didn t feel important i felt like a child but i didn t show them the robot animal the official said i don t believe you there are no animals in the galaxy now perhaps there never were any animals they re only stories in the book of remembering well why are you asking me so many questions i said because your robot tells the same story because you have a crazy man in you spaceship he s in hospital now suddenly the official got up and took me to the lift we went down down down very fast we came out into a room in the shape of a star i felt frightened because i knew this was the star room where the star council met the council men and women came in and took their places at the star table the official told them my story which my robot repeated everybody looked at me waiting for me to show them the robot animal the president of the star council said where is this animal it s not an animal i said it s a robot but it looks just the same as a real animal where is it i touched the robot s stomach in there i answered bring it out we want to see it the president said yes sir i said i looked round at all the councillors i was afraid to speak to these important people but i had to tell them about the danger when buff saw an animal he went crazy i went crazy at first too we heard your story please listen i said this is a robot please remember it s not a real animal i don t want anybody here to go crazy don t try to frighten us girl bring out the animal i told the robot to open its stomach and it opened the little robot animal jumped on to the star table it looked so alive it opened its mouth and made the special noise of that animal it had small sharp white teeth the mouth of every councillor fell open at the same moment there was a sudden bright light the little animal exploded it was gone there was nothing left except a little wet plastic on the star table and a smell of burning hair the star council official had destroyed it with his laser gun the councillors were getting up and shouting their faces were full of hate they had the same crazy eyes as buff perhaps not as bad as buff because the animal had only been there for a second or two and i had told them it was a robot but like buff they wanted to kill and destroy things got worse and worse they started breaking chairs some of them used broken chairs to hit people they were going crazy just like buff the plan had failed the star council had gone crazy i was very frightened what had i done two of everything it was a strange prison with no doors and no police to watch me well i didn t know the special number for making the lifts work so i couldn t escape by the lifts there were stairs but it was ten kilometres straight up to get to the surface i couldn t get out i found food and water nobody came to see me for three days finally a soldier arrived and took me back to the star room an old man with a very straight back sat at the star table he was alone and looked tired hummingbird he said and then stopped who are you please i asked i hadn t seen him before i m the new president he said but he didn t sound happy about it so the president and the councillors are still still crazyyes the old man said i think many of them will get better they saw the animal only for a very short time it wasn t a real animal i said quickly that didn t make any difference you asked me who i am i m just one of the star councillors but i wasn t in the star room when you showed them the animal i was lucky now listen hummingbird there is something i must tell you something difficult is it about my family i asked feeling afraid no hummingbird you are the only person in the galaxy who knows where the star zoo is if other people know about the star zoo there will be killing people will be killed the star zoo will be destroyed it is very important to keep the star zoo alive and so it is necessary to keep it secret i m sorry hummingbird you must stay here ten kilometres down all your life i know you re a young girl and i m sorry all my life i said i couldn t believe it yes the old man said this is the planet of the star council so there is always work here you can do i m sorry what kind of work i asked well everything is going crazy now for example we have some little children down here that nobody is taking care of a robot is doing the job now but little children need real humans would you like to try taking care of them ok i said it was something to do i went to see the children who were playing quietly with a robot i laughed because the robot was our family robot i thought this robot and i would do something wonderful but we could only take care of little children i sat on the floor and played with the children they were all less than four years old they needed somebody a few of the children were crying they needed loving robots can sing and play games but they can t love only the star zoo computer can love soon one little boy was sitting on my stomach and another boy was running round and round me a little girl was pulling my hair and another girl was biting my finger there was a lot of noise these children were more trouble than any animal in the star zoo these girls and boys aren t going to be afraid of animals i said to the robot i can show them a robot animal and they won t go crazy i just wish i had one you have the robot answered shall i take out the other one what i shouted the little boy fell off my stomach and began screaming i picked him up and kissed him until the screaming changed to crying i said another robot animal yes the robot said touching its stomach of course the robot had another robots always make two of everything you don t have to tell them they do it automatically the robot opened its stomach and the second robot animal jumped out it was just like the first one the little boy stopped crying he looked at the robot animal with big round eyes all the other children were looking too the animal began to play it tried to bite its tail and fell over its own feet it was a funny sweet animal after one minute the children were round it in a circle laughing and playing with it just like the humans in the star zoo i watched them this was very important these children hadn t learnt to be afraid of animals because they had never heard of earth the burning or the book of remembering i watched and thought i spoke softly to my robot if these children go on playing with this robot animal they will never become afraid of animals they won t go crazy i thought some more and said but if their parents see the animal the parents will go crazy i thought carefully yes there must be a special room in every house a room which parents couldn t go in a room for children only then children could play with robot animals in that room that s it i said the children will still be happy to be with animals when they are parents it might take twenty thirty forty years but then i heard the sound of somebody coming i shouted to the robot hide that animal quick the robot opened its stomach and the animal went inside all the children began crying they wanted to have their wonderful animal back again it was the president he looked round at all the crying children did i do this he asked no i answered please stay i have fantastic news for you listen to what just happened the old man listened first he was angry then he was surprised but in the end he became very excited hummingbird the president said i must not see that robot animal i don t want to go crazy your idea is interesting i think it will work we must be very careful we can begin with just one family and can learn from our mistakes i think we can let you go free hummingbid you can see the animal again soon i promised the children and kissed the ones that were still crying so the little children really liked this animal the president said what kind of animal was it does the book of remembering talk about it the book of remembering talks about cats i answered this is a baby cat i can t remember what the computer called it oh yes i do it s called a kitten the fall of the house of usher it was a grey autumn day and the sky was full of large black clouds all day i had ridden through flat and uninteresting countryside but at last as it began to grow dark i saw the end of my journey there in front of me stood the house of usher and at once i do not know why a strange feeling of deep gloom came down on me and covered me like a blanket i looked up at the old house with its high stone walls and narrow windows i looked around at the thin dry grass and the old dying trees and an icy hand seemed to take hold of my heart i felt cold and sick and could not think of one happy thought to chase away my gloom why i wondered did the house of usher make me feel so sad i could find no answer there was a lake next to the house and i rode my horse up to the edge and stopped perhaps from here the house would not seem so sad so full of gloom i looked down into the mirror of dark still water and saw again the empty eye like windows of the house and the dying trees all around it the feeling of gloom was stronger than ever it was in this house that i was going to spend the next few weeks its owner roderick usher had been a good friend of mine when i was a boy i had not seen him for many years but recently he had sent me a letter a sad and terrible letter he wrote that he was ill ill in body and ill in mind that he wanted and needed to see me i was his only friend the only person who could help him in his illness although we had been good friends when we were young i knew very little about him he had never spoken much about himself but i knew that he came from a very old family of which he was the last living man i also knew that in the usher family there had never been many children and so for hundreds of years the family name together with the family home had passed straight from father to son as i stood by the lake my feeling of gloom grew and grew i knew also that underneath my gloom lay fear and fear does strange things to the mind i began to imagine that the gloom was not in my mind but was something real it was like a mysterious cloud which seemed to come straight from the dark lake and the dying trees and the old walls of the house a heavy grey cloud which carried with it disease and fear this was a dream i told myself and i looked more carefully at the building in front of me it was indeed very old and i noticed that every stone had cracks and holes in it but there was nothing really wrong with the building no stones were missing the only thing that i noticed was a very small crack which started at the top of the building and continued all the way down into the dark waters of the lake i went up to the front of the house a servant took my horse and i stepped into the large hall another servant led me silently upstairs on the walls there were many strange dark pictures which made me feel nervous i remembered these pictures from my earlier visits to the house when i was a child but the feelings that the pictures gave me on this visit were new to me on the stairs we met the family doctor he had a strange look on his face a look that i did not like i hurried on and finally the servant opened a door and took me into the study the room was large and long with high narrow windows which let in only a little light shadows lay in all the corners of the room and around the dark pieces of furniture there were many books and a few guitars but there was no life no happiness in the room deep gloom filled the air when usher saw me he got up and welcomed me warmly i thought he was just being polite but as i looked into his face i could see that he was pleased to see me we sat down but he did not speak at first and for a few moments i watched him in surprise and fear he had changed so much since our last meeting he had the same pale thin face the same eyes large and clear and the same thin lips and soft hair but now his skin was too white his eyes too large and bright and he seemed a different man he frightened me and his long wild hair looked like a ghostly cloud around his head i noticed that my friend was very nervous and that his feelings changed very quickly sometimes he talked a lot then he suddenly became silent and did not say a word for many hours at other times he found it difficult to think and his voice was heavy and slow like the voice of a man who had drunk too much he told me why he had wanted to see me and how he hoped to feel better now that i was with him he had he explained a strange illness which had been in his family for a long time it was a nervous illness which made him feel everything much more strongly than other people he could only eat food that was almost tasteless he had to choose his clothes very carefully because most of them hurt his skin he could not have flowers in his room because their smell was too strong for him light hurt his eyes and most sounds hurt his ears except the soft sound of guitars worst of all he was a prisoner of his own fear i shall die he used to say because of this fear i m not afraid of danger what frightens me is fear itself at the moment i am fighting against fear but sooner or later i won t be able to fight any more during long conversations with usher i learnt more about his strange illness he was sure that it came from the house of usher itself he had not left the house for many years and he had become he thought as sad as the house itself the gloom of its grey walls and its dark silent lake had become his own he also believed that much of his sadness was because his dear sister was seriously ill he had one sister madeleine the only other person in his family who was still living but each day she seemed a little nearer to death her death usher said blackly will leave me alone in the world the last of all the ushers while he was speaking madeleine passed slowly through the back of the long room and without noticing me disappeared as i looked at her my eyes felt heavy with sleep and i had a strange feeling of fear i looked across at usher he had covered his face with his hands but i could see that he had become even paler and that he was crying silently lady madeleine s illness was a mysterious one which no doctor could understand every day she became weaker and thinner and sometimes went into a sleep which was more like death than sleep for years she had fought bravely against her illness but on the night of my arrival she went to bed and did not get up from it again you will probably not see her again alive usher said to me shaking his head sadly during the next few days usher and i never spoke about his sister we spent a lot of time painting and reading together and sometimes he played on his guitar i tried very hard to help my friend but i realized that his sadness was too deep it was a black gloom that covered everything that belonged to his world sometimes indeed he seemed close to the edge of madness he painted strange pictures and sang mysterious songs with wild words his ideas too were strange and he had one idea thst seemed more important to him than all the others he was quite sure that all things plants trees even stones were able to feel the house of usher itself he told me is like a living thing when the walls were first built life went into the stones themselves and year after year it has grown stronger even the air around the walls and above the lake has its own life and belongs to the house don t you see he cried how the stones and the air have shaped the lives of the usher family these ideas were too fantastic for me and i could not answer him one evening i was reading quietly when my friend told me in very few words that the lady madeleine had died he had decided he said to keep her body for a fortnight in one of the vaults under the house before it went to its last resting place this was because his sister s illness had been a mysterious one and her doctors wanted to learn more about it he asked me to help him and i agreed together we carried the body in its coffin down to the vaults under the house the vault that he had chosen was a long way down but was under the part of the house where i slept it had once been a prison and was small dark and airless with a heavy metal door we put the coffin down and then gently lifted up the cover to look at the dead woman for the last time as i looked down at her face i realized how much usher s sister looked like him my friend then said a few quiet words and i learnt that he and his sister had been born on the same day each had known the other s mind without the need for words we could not look at her for long her strange illness had left her with a soft pink colour on her face and that unchanging half smile on her lips which is so terrible in death we put back the cover of the coffin fixed it down well and after locking the heavy door of the vault went back upstairs into the gloomy house after some days of deep unhappiness i saw that my friend s illness of the mind was growing worse he did not paint or read any more he moved slowly from room to room never knowing what to do his face became paler the light disappeared from his eyes and his voice often shook with fear when he spoke sometimes i thought he was trying to tell me some terrible secret at other times i thought he was going mad he used to sit for hours looking at nothing listening to nothing except the sounds in his own mind i myself began to know real fear i felt my friend s terror his deep gloom slowly taking hold of my own mind about seven or eight days after we had put lady madeleine s coffin in the vault i went to bed but could not sleep hour after hour i lay there fighting the fear and gloom that filled my mind outside there was a storm which was growing wilder and my room was full of shadows and the dark shapes of the gloomy furniture i tried to calm myself but i only became more frightened suddenly my body shook with a new terror i sat up in bed and listened hard yes i could hear some low sounds coming not from the storm outside but from somewhere inside the house quickly i put on my clothes and started walking up and down the room trying to shake off my terrible fear then i heard a knock on my door and usher came in his face was as white as it had always been and there was a kind of madness in his eyes the look on his face frightened me terribly but at the same time i was pleased not to be alone any more for some moments he looked around without saying a word then suddenly have you not seen it no then wait you must see it he hurried to the window and opened it the wind from the violent storm outside crashed into the room nearly knocking us to the floor it was indeed a wild but strangely beautiful night the wind seemed to be going in circles around the house and huge heavy black clouds chased each other first this way then that way we could see no moon and no stars but a pale ghostly light lay around the house you mustn t no you must not watch this i cried to usher i pushed him gently away from the window and to a seat it s only a storm and the cold night air will be dangerous to your health let s close the window and read together look here s one of your favourite books i will read to you and you can listen and so we will pass this terrible night together the book which i had picked up was the sad mad life of sir launcelot canning it was not really one of us her s favourite books but it was the only one that i had near me so i started to read it it was a wild fantastic story but i hoped that my reading would make usher calmer and less afraid he listened to me indeed but with a kind of mad seriousness that i found frightening i read for a while and reached the place in the book where ethelred broke down the door of the old man s house now ethelred decided he could wait outside in the storm no longer he lifted his heavy stick and beat against the wood en door until he had made a hole then with his hands he pulled the door to pieces the noise of the dry wood cracking and breaking could be heard all through the forest as i finished reading this sentence i jumped in my seat and then sat very still i thought that i had heard from somewhere far away in the house the same noise of cracking and breaking wood but i could not hear it clearly and the noise of the storm was much louder i continued reading ethelred entered the house but could not see the old man then the house disappeared and he saw a dragon with fire coming out of its mouth ethelred lifted his heavy stick and brought it crashing down on the dragon s head as the dragon fell dying to the ground it gave a terrible cry a long hard unnatural scream here again i stopped suddenly i was sure that i could hear a cry it was low and far away but it was a long screaming sound just like the one described in the book although i was feeling so nervous i tried hard to hide my terror i was not sure if usher had heard the sounds that i had heard in the last few minutes he had moved and was now sitting with his face towards the door but i could see that his lips were shaking and his body was moving gently from side to side i continued reading the story and now ethelred after he had killed the dragon turned and saw in front of him a palace of gold with tall gates of shining silver in the walls bravely ethelred ran towards the palace but the shining silver gates did not wait for his coming and fell to the ground at his feet with a great and terrible ringing sound as i read these words i heard clearly the loud heavy sound of metal falling i jumped to my feet but usher sat in his seat and did not move i ran towards him he was looking straight in front of him and his face was like stone as i placed my hand on his arm his body began to shake a sickly smile came over his lips and he spoke in a low hurried voice he did not seem to realize that i was there i put my head close to his to catch his words don t i hear it yes i hear it and i have heard it for many minutes many hours many days i have heard it but i was too frightened too frightened to speak we have put her alive into her coffin did i not tell you that i could hear even the softest sound i tell you now that i heard her move in the coffin i heard the sounds many days ago but my terror was too great i could not speak and now tonight when you read about ethelred breaking the old man s door about the cry of the dragon and the falling of the gates it was in fact the breaking of her coffin the scream of metal as she broke open the vault and the ringing crash as the metal door fell to the floor oh where can i escape to is she hurrying towards me at this very minute is that her angry footstep that i can hear on the stairs can i hear the heavy and terrible beating of her heart madman he jumped up and shouted screaming out his words like a man dying in terror madman i tell you that at this minute she is standing outside this door as he screamed these words the heavy door was thrown open by the strong wind there outside the door dressed in the white clothes of the dead stood the tall figure of the lady madeleine of usher there was blood on her hands her arms her torn white clothes every part of her body showed the marks of her long fight to escape from the coffin for a moment she stood there shaking moving slowly from side to side then with a low cry she fell heavily onto her brother and in the moment of her now final death he fell with her to the floor a dead man killed by his own terror from that room and from that house i ran in horror out side the storm was still violent and as i ran past the lake a sudden wild light shone around me i turned to see where this strange light was coming from it was the moon a full blood red moon shining through a narrow crack in the walls of the house it was the crack which started at the roof of the building and went right down to the ground as i watched the crack grew larger the wind grew wilder now i could see the full circle of the blood red moon and the great walls of the house breaking and falling there was a long shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters and the deep dark lake closed over the broken pieces of the house of usher the black cat i know you will not believe this story only a madman could hope that you would believe it and i am not mad but as i am going to die tomorrow i would like to tell my story to the world today perhaps some day somebody more calm and less excitale than me will be able to explain it i have always loved animals i loved them deeply from the very first days of my life when i was young we always had many animals in our house and so i used to spend most of my days playing with them and taking care of them as the years passed i grew into a quiet gentle man and my love for animals grew too i found that they were more friendly more honest than most men animals were always my best friends i got married when i was quite young luckily my wife loved animals too and she used to buy me many animals as presents in fact our house was always full of animals we had birds fish a dog chickens and a cat this cat whom we called pluto was a large black cat he was a beautiful animal and he was also very clever i loved pluto more than i loved all my other animals i wanted to do everything for him myself so i never let my wife take care of him i used to play with him and give him his food and he followed me everywhere i went for several years pluto and i were the best of friends but during this time my life slowly changed i became a heavy drinker and my need for alcohol soon grew into a terrible disease i was often angry and violent i began to shout at my wife and i even started to hit her my animals too felt the change in me i stopped taking care of them and sometimes i was even cruel to them but i was never cruel to pluto as time passed my disease grew worse and soon even pluto was not safe from my violence one night i arrived home late i was very very drunk when pluto saw me he tried to run away from me and this made me angry i caught him by his neck and shook him he in his fright bit me on the hand at once a wild terrible anger filled me and i could feel nothing except burning hate slowly i took a knife from my pocket opened it and then carefully cut out one of pluto s eyes from its socket i shake today as i write these words down every time i remember that day i still feel sadness and pain when i woke up the next morning i felt ashamed of what i had done but this feeling was not strong enough to make me change my life i continued to drink because it was too difficult for me to stop soon i had forgotten what i had done as the months passed pluto got better his empty eye socket still looked terrible but at least he wasn t in pain any more not surprisingly he used to run away from me when he saw me frightened that i would hurt him again at first i was sad to see him run away an animal which had once so loved me then i began to feel a little angry there is something strange about the human heart we humans seem to like hurt ing ourselves haven t we all a hundred times done something stupid or evil just because we know that we should not do it it was because of this this need to hurt myself that i did this next evil thing one morning i woke found a rope and calmly tied it round pluto s neck then i hung the poor animal from a tree and left it there to die i cried as i did this terrible thing my face was wet with tears and my heart was black and heavy but i killed it i killed it because i knew it had loved me because it hadn t hurt me even because i knew that i was doing something terrible and wrong that same night we had a fire in our house i was woken from my sleep by loud shouts of fire when i opened my eyes i found that the fire had already reached the bedroom my wife and i ran out of the house as fast as we could luckily we escaped death but the house and almost everything in it was destroyed the next day i went back into the house and saw several people standing in a group looking at a wall it was the only wall of the house that was still standing after the fire it was one of my bedroom walls the one where the head of my bed had rested as i came nearer to the wall i heard someone say how strange and another person that s impossible and then i saw it a huge cat not a real cat but the shape of a cat outlined in the white bedroom wall it was as clear as a picture i could even see a rope around the animal s neck i stood there in horror too frightened to move then slowly i thought back to the night before i had left the cat hanging from a tree in the garden at the back of my house when a neighbour had first noticed the fire many people had run into the garden one of them had probably cut the cat from the tree and thrown it through my open window in order to wake me up the cat s body had hit my bedroom wall and left its shape there because the plaster on that wall was new and still soft although i thought that this was a very reasonable explanation the strange shape on the wall still worried me i thought about the cat day and night i began to feel sorry that i had killed it i started walking around the streets at night looking at all the cats to see if i could find another one like pluto one night i was drinking in my favourite bar when i suddenly noticed a large black cat i went up to it and touched it it was very large as large as pluto had been it also looked very like pluto except for one thing pluto had been black all over but this cat had a white mark on its front i touched the cat and he immediately lay down against my leg and seemed very friendly towards me this i decided was the cat that i wanted i offered the barman some money to buy the cat from him but he said that the cat didn t belong to him in fact he had no idea where it had come from so i took the cat home my wife liked it immediately and it stayed with us from that day but soon i do not know why the cat started to make me angry and as time passed i began to hate it i did not hurt it in any way but i always tried to keep as far away from it as possible i knew one reason why i hated this cat so much oh the morning after i had brought it home i saw that like pluto it had lost one of its eyes my wife who was the kind gentle per son that i had once been only loved the cat more because of this but the cat didn t like my wife it loved me alone every time i sat down it used to jump onto my knees when i went out of a room it used to run out in front of me and get between my feet or climb up my legs at these times i wanted to kill it but i didn t because i was too afraid afraid of the cat and even more afraid of the white mark on its chest i have already mentioned this mark at first there was nothing strange about it it was just a white mark but slowly this mark grew and changed until it had the clear shape of a terrible a horrible thing i find it difficult here in my prison to write the word it was the shape of the gallows yes those horrible wooden posts from which they hang men by a rope around the neck as each day passed my fear grew and grew i a man a strong man had become afraid of a cat why was i so fright ened so worried by a stupid animal day and night i could get no rest i had the most terrible dreams and my mind turned to dark evil thoughts i hated everything everybody and life itself one day my wife and i needed to get something from the cellar underneath the house the cat followed us down the steps and threw itself in front of me i almost fell on my face and mad with anger i took hold of an axe and tried to kill the animal but my wife caught my arm to stop me and then anger exploded in my mind i turned and drove the axe deep into her head she fell dead on the floor without a sound after this horrible murder i calmly made plans to hide the body i knew i couldn t take it out of the house either by day or night because the neighbours would see me so i had to think of other ways i could cut the body up into very small pieces and then burn them in a fire i could hide the body under the floor or i could put the body in a box and then ask someone to carry the box away finally i thought of a better idea i decided to hide the body behind the walls of the cellar i knew immediately which wall to choose there was a wall in the cellar round the bottom of an old chimney which was no longer used this wall had bricks in the front and back but was empty in the middle i started work at once i took out some of the bricks from the front wall and carefully put the body against the back wall then i put back the bricks and covered them with plaster i made sure that the plaster did not look new and soon the wall looked just the same as all the other walls when i had finished my work i looked at the plaster i ve never done a better piece of work i said to myself happily i then looked around for the cat to kill it it had brought too much unhappiness into my life and so it too must now die i looked for it everywhere but it had disappeared i was free at last that night i had a deep peaceful sleep i who had just killed my wife slept well three days passed and still the cat did not appear i was now a happy man happier than i had been for a long time i wasn t worried by what i had done people had asked a few questions and the police had visited my house but they had found nothing on the fourth day the police visited again and began to search the house they looked into all the rooms and then went down into the cellar i went with them feeling calm and safe i watched them as they looked everywhere they seemed quite happy that there was nothing there and they got ready to leave i was very happy i was sure that i was safe but i wanted to say something just a word or two to show how unworried i was gentlemen i said i m pleased that you ve found nothing here and that you are now leaving this house but let me show you something gentlemen do you see how well built this house is these walls you will notice are very strong as i said these words i knocked on the wall with a stick the wall where i had hidden my wife at that moment we heard a sound it was a strange sound unlike anything i had ever heard before the sound was soft at first almost like a baby crying then it grew louder and louder and turned into one long endless scream it was like a cry rising from hell the policemen looked at me then at one another they ran to the wall and started pulling out the bricks as fast as they could in minutes the wall was down and there for all to see was the body of my dead wife on top of her head with a red open mouth and one burning eye sat the black cat the animal which had made me a murderer and which would now send me to my death i had put the horrible thing into the wall alive with my wife the masque of the red death the red death had been in the country for many many years no disease had ever been so deadly people called it the red death because it left blood red horrible blood on the body and face of each person it visited and no one if visited was ever left alive once a person was touched by the red death he immediately felt pains and soon afterwards started to bleed from every part of his body in thirty minutes he was dead after that no one not even his family went near the blood covered body everybody was afraid of the red death everybody except the fearless prince prospero he refused to be troubled by it although half the people of his country had already died from this terrible disease he continued to enjoy life to the full one day he decided to invite a thousand of his strong and brave friends to stay with him in one of his castles far out in the countryside there the red death would not be able to touch them it was a huge and extraordinary castle built to prince prospero s own plan it had strong high walls and great gates of heavy metal now when the prince and his friends arrived at the castle gates they went inside locked the gates carefully and threw away the keys in that way no one would be able to enter or escape they were all there together far away from the red death now they could forget the world outside and think only of themselves they had everything they needed to amuse themselves because the prince had forgotten nothing he had brought in food and wine actors musicians and dancers all of this and life itself was inside the castle outside lay the red death towards the end of the fifth or sixth month while the red death was at its most deadly outside the prince gave a wonderful masked ball for his friends it was a wild and wonderful ball but first let me tell you about the rooms in which he gave the ball there were seven rooms in all in most castles of course the rooms for great parties or dances join each other end to end in this way when the doors at the end of each room are opened the seven rooms become one huge room and you can see from the first room right through to the last one in prospero s castle it was different each room turned suddenly round a corner into the next so if you were standing in one room it was impossible to see into the other rooms in the middle of each wall on the right and left there was a tall narrow window opening onto the closed passage which ran along beside all seven rooms each window was made of different coloured glass and the colour of the glass was the same as the colour of the room that it opened onto the first room for example was blue and so its windows were also a deep blue the second room was purple and so the windows too were purple the third was green with green windows the fourth orange the fifth white and the sixth violet the seventh room was black its walls were black its thick heavy carpet was also black but its windows were red a deep blood red there were no candles in any of the rooms the only light came from fires in hanging metal baskets which were in the passages outside the rooms each fire was opposite a window and so the light from the fire shone through the coloured glass and filled each room with strange and fantastic shadows but in the black room the firelight that shone through the blood red window changed the room into something too horrible to describe in that strange light faces became wild and frightening and few people were brave enough to enter the room at all in this room against the farthest wall stood a huge black clock every hour it chimed loud and deep and clear filling the castle with its long gloomy sound and while the clock chimed the musicians stopped playing and even the wildest dancers stood still in silence and fear listening to the passing of another hour hour but when the chiming stopped people looked at each other and laughed trying hard to pretend that they had not been frightened happiness came into the castle again until the clock chimed the passing of the next hour and the same fear returned prince prospero s ball although given in these strange rooms was wild and happy the prince had planned every thing the colours the paintings on the walls even the cloaks and masks worn by each one of his friends he had chosen all the clothes with the greatest of care putting together the beautiful and the ugly the strange and the fantastic the surprising and the frightening each man and woman was dressed like a terrible dream and in and out of the rooms these dreams walked and danced their clothes changing colour each time they entered a different room but no one was brave enough now to enter the black room as the night passed and the fires burned brighter the colours and shapes in this room became more horrible than ever the black carpet and walls seemed full of gloom and the deep chimes of the black clock sounded even more frightening but the other six rooms were full of life and pleasure people were dancing and singing talking and laughing and the wild noise of a thousand happy men and women rang through the castle then came the hour of midnight and once again dancers and musicians became still and silent as the clock slowly rang the twelve long chimes of midnight and because the twelve chimes took a long time to ring each person had more time to think and feel uncomfortable they also had time before the last chime had sounded to notice a masked figure who had not been there before the first person who saw the stranger told the next person who told another and in a few minutes a cry of fear and horror rose up from the crowd now you will remember that everyone at the ball was wearing strange cloaks and masks which belonged more to the world of dreams and wild imagination than to everyday life so why you may ask this horror and this fear but even in the cruellest heart there are some fears too terrible to laugh at the tall thin figure of the stranger was dressed from head to foot in the white clothes of the dead and the mask over the face was frighteningly real it was the face of a dead man worse still the face and the body were covered with red horrible blood here in the middle of all that dancing and happiness was a living picture of the red death when prince prospero saw the masked stranger his face became white with fear then his fear turned to anger and he shouted out who is that who is mad enough to play games with us and with death in this way take hold of him and pull off his mask i want to see the face of the man who tomorrow will hang from the castle roof the prince was in the blue room as he said these words they rang loudly and clearly through the seven rooms many of the prince s friends started to run towards the masked figure but they were all too frightened to touch him with slow and silent steps the stranger walked slowly towards the prince passing very near to him then he continued walking and went from the blue room into the purple one from the purple into the green and then into the orange room the white room and then the violet room no one tried to stop him then prince prospero mad with anger hurried through the six rooms with a sword in his hand as the masked figure entered the black room the prince was close behind him hold ing his sword up high at that moment the stranger turned suddenly to look at the prince there was a loud cry and the sword fell upon the black carpet followed by the dead body of the fearless prince prospero at once a crowd of people ran into the black room and took hold of the masked stranger he was standing very still in the shadow of the black clock angrily they pulled away the clothes and the mask but then they backed away in horror because inside the clothes and mask they found nothing and now each person in the castle understood that the red death was there among them it had come like a thief in the night and one by one they fell down dead and the black clock stopped ringing with the death of the last person and the fires also died away and the only things left in the castle were darkness and the red death william wilson william wilson is not my name but i shall use it in this story because my real name is too well known too hated in every corner of the world my evil crimes have made sure of that and as the day of my death comes nearer i feel the need to write to explain to you how my life of crime began most men become evil slowly they start with little crimes and then move on to bigger ones but i am different i moved into real crime with just one big step has any man lived a life as evil as mine but now the shadow of death fills me with fear day and night i have the most terrible dreams perhaps someone somewhere will feel sorry for me listen to my story i was a wild and excitable child my parents worried about me and often tried to punish me but they never succeeded in changing me i refused to obey them and i never followed any orders that they gave me i wanted to be free so i listened only to myself the first school that i can remember was a large and very old house in a small quiet english village as i write i can sill feel the coolness of the shadowy gardens near the house i can smell the sweetness of the flowers and hear the deep sound of the church bells as they rang every hour these feelings give me some moments of happiness as i sit here in black misery waiting for death in fact it is here in this school that my story really begins the school building was large and dd the big gardens were closed in by a high wall with broken glass at the top just like a prison we only went out three times a week on saturday afternoons we took a walk in some fields near the school under the watchful eye of one of our teachers on sundays we went out twice morning and evening to go to the village church i was not bored or unhappy during my life at school children can amuse themselves very easily and in my imagination i lived an exciting life full of mystery and interest but in the real world the days were always the same we woke up and went to bed we walked in the fields and played in the play ground the playground was indeed a very special place it was a place where friends were made and lost a place always full of trouble and excitement i was the kind of boy who liked to give orders not to take them i always wanted to win every game every fight and to be first in everything all the other boys even those a bit older than myself were happy to follow and obey me all that is except one his name was the same as mine so i shall call him william william too we were not from the same family but we both had the same name this was not surprising because my name was not an unusual one this william wilson refused to obey me he argued with me both in class and in the playground and tried to stop the other boys from following me actually i think i was the only boy who realized what he was doing he did everything very cleverly and silently and in this way nobody really noticed it but i i noticed what he did and i was frightened by it i was afraid that wilson was stronger than i was i became worried and angry when i saw the other boys follow him instead of me but wilson was always cool and calm nothing ever troubled him he seemed to want one thing only to see me fright ened and unhappy but at the same time i sometimes noticed that he showed a friendliness towards me which was most unwelcome to me it is difficult for me to describe my feelings towards wilson i didn t hate him but neither did i like him i think that more than anything i felt afraid of him at the same time i wanted to know more about him i wanted to find something that frightened or worried him but i could find nothing there was nothing strange in the way he looked or walked nothing that is except for one thing his voice his voice was strange when he spoke he could never speak loudly in fact he never spoke above a whisper wilson was quick to find the one thing that i really did not like it was my name although i come from an old and famous family my name is a very everyday one it could belong to any unimportant workman i had always hated my name but now i hated it even more because both of us had the same name i heard it twice as often and there was something that worried me even more deeply we seemed to look alike as well we were as tall as one another we were both thin and even our faces were alike because our names were the same i knew that the older boys thought that we were brothers but nobody seemed to notice that we looked alike but wilson noticed it and he also saw that i was angry about it nothing ever escaped him he always knew my deepest feelings after a while he started to dress like me and even to walk like me luckily he could not speak like me when i spoke loudly but when i spoke in a whisper his whisper was just like mine all these things troubled me deeply i could see that wilson enjoyed making me angry and he used to laugh at me secretly strangely the other boys never noticed how he made fun of me and copied me in every way i was the only one who noticed it very often he used to give me advice telling me quietly what i should do or what i should say i hated him even more when he did this today of course i realize that his advice was always very good and sensible what a pity that i never followed it as time went by i became more and more angry with him why should he or anyone give me advice my feelings towards him changed and i actually began to hate him he noticed this and tried not to come near me so much one day towards the end of my fifth year at school we had a violent argument while we were arguing he showed his feelings more openly than usual and a very strange idea came into my mind i thought how can i describe it i thought just for a second or two that i had known him before a long long time ago when we were very young children it was as i say a strange and very stupid idea and i forgot it as quickly as i could but that night when every one was asleep i got out of bed then i walked through the dark building with a small lantern in my hands until i reached wilson s room i left the lantern outside and went near to his bed yes he was a sleep i returned to get my lantern and went back to his bed i had planned to do something cruel to him while he slept but as i looked at the sleeping boy my heart beat faster and i was filled with fear was this really what william wilson looked like did he look just the same when he was awake i knew that he was as tall as i was i knew too that he walked like me and talked like me and copied me in every way that he could but was it possible that the person in that bed looked so like me in every way i began to shake with fear and my body turned ice cold surely he couldn t look like this was i really looking at a boy who was not just a copy of me but i was more frightened than i had ever been in my life i went silently out of his room left the school building and never returned there again after several lazy months at home i was sent to eton one of the most famous english bys schools there i soon forgot william wilson and the strange fears i had felt if i thought about them at all i used to laugh at myself my life at eton lasted for three wild and evil years i learnt to be clever and secret and was interested only in new ways of amusing myself i chose the worst kind of students for my friends and spent all my time in evil enjoyment one night when i was in my third year i invited some students to a party in my rooms we drank and played cards all through the night as well as the wine we had other perhaps more dangerous pleasures as the first morning light started to appear i suggested a new evil amusement then i noticed that somebody was opening my door and i heard a servant s voice there s somebody outside who wants to speak to you sir he seems to be in a hurry i walked with difficulty to the hall as i was feeling very drunk with the wine it was still too dark to see clearly but i could just see the shape of a young man he was as tall as i was and was wearing the same clothes as myself i could not see his face he came up to me and whispered the words william wilson in my ear i knew the voice at once it was impossible to mistake it those two words were enough to fill me with fear before i could look into his face he had disappeared the meeting only lasted a few seconds but for some weeks i could not forget it i thought of it all the time who and what was this william wilson where did he come from what did he want from me my questions stayed unanswered but i did discover one thing i learnt that william wilson had left my last school on the same day that i myself had run away from it soon i forgot about him again and not long afterwards i went up to oxford university my parents were not sensible people and they always gave me a lot of money i was able to live a fashionable expensive life and to choose as my friends the sons of the richest families of england there was nothing at all to stop me now i spent my money wildly and passed my days and nights in dangerous and exciting pleasures at oxford i spent a lot of my time gambling i became in fact a most clever and successful gambler no better than a thief i played cards in order to win money from the other students and become even richer of course i was careful to play only with students who were bad at playing cards in this way i could be sure of winning every time my friends were not clever enough to see what i was doing in my second year at university i met a new student called glendinning he came from an old english family and was one of the richest students in the university i soon realized that he was very unintelligent and because of this he was of course a very suitable person for me to gamble with i started to play cards with him often and for some time i made sure that he always won at last i decided that the time was right and i made my plans carefully i met glendinning at the rooms of a friend of mine a mr preston who had no idea of my secret plan eight or ten other friends were also invited in this way glendinning had no idea that i planned to gamble with him that evening in fact at the party it was he who first suggested playing cards we played for many long hours in the end by my careful plan i was playing alone against glendinning while the others watched our game glendinning had drunk a lot of wine during the evening and his hands were beginning to shake a little from fear or from the wine i wasn t sure he had already lost a large amount of money then he did what i had hoped for he took another long drink of wine and said let s double the stakes beginners always think they can win back what they have lost in this way at first i pretended to refuse then he became angry so naturally i had to agree my plan was working excellently we continued playing and in less than an hour my winnings were four times as big glendinning s face was now as white as a sheet everyone around the table started talking and to my surprise i heard the words that s the end of glendinning he s just lost everything he had i had heard that glendinning was very rich indeed rich enough to lose a lot of money and not to worry about it now i understood from the whispers around the table that this was not true i had in fact won everything he owned and so destroyed him nobody spoke glendinning had covered his face with his hands and everyone clearly felt very sorry for him even i began to feel a little worried and wondered what i should do as we stood in silence the doors suddenly opened and a strong wind filled the room it blew out all the candles in the room and we were left in darkness but in the few seconds before the candles went out we noticed that a man had entered the room he was about as tall as i was and his face and body were hidden by a long cloak as we stood in the darkness we could feel him standing in the room then he began to speak he spoke in a whisper and his voice filled me with fear gentlemen he said i am here because i have something important to tell you i am afraid that you do not really know the man who has just won so much money from glendinning let me tell you how to learn more about him please look very carefully inside his left sleeve and at the several little packets inside the large pockets of his jacket immediately after these words he left the room as silently as he had entered it that moment was one of the worst moments of my life i had no time to do anything my friends fell on me angrily lit the candles again and searched my clothes they found the single cards hidden carefully inside my left sleeve and in my pockets they discovered the packets of special cards which helped me to win every game i played my friends stood around me in a circle and looked at me in silence mr preston then picked up a cloak from the floor mr wilson he said here is your cloak you will i hope leave my room and then leave oxford immediately i wanted to hit him but something stopped me it was the cloak that preston was holding in his hands although it looked like my cloak i knew that it wasn t because my own cloak was already over my left arm it was a very unusual and expensive cloak which a shop had made specially for me how was it possible that there was now another cloak just like it i thought back to the moment when the stranger had come into the room yes he had been wearing a cloak too full of fear i quickly took the cloak from mr preston and left the room the next morning i left oxford and escaped to europe i was now known to be a cheat at cards and every door in england would be closed against me but bad luck travelled with me in fact i soon realized that my troubles at oxford had been only the beginning soon after i arrived in paris i met william wilson again there too he destroyed my evil hopes everywhere i went year after year he appeared like a ghost and came between me and my plans in rome he stopped me from getting what i wanted in vienna too in berlin and even in moscow wasn t there anywhere where i could be left alone i went from city to city trying to escape from him but i couldn t feel free i couldn t be alone he followed me everywhere again and again i used to ask myself these questions who is he where does he come from what does he want from me but i could find no answer i thought deeply about all the times when i had seen him in every city i realized wilson had done the same thing he had not stopped my plans all the time but only when they were evil and dangerous either to others or to myself i understood all this but still i was very angry why couldn t wilson leave me alone why couldn t he let me live in the way i wanted to i realized another thing too every time wilson appeared he had never let me see his face i had always noticed his clothes it was difficult not to notice them because they were always the same as mine but he kept his face hidden from me why did he do this did he really think that i was so stupid did he think i hadn t realized who he was the man who followed me everywhere and destroyed my plans again and again was the same william wilson of my schooldays but let me continue with my story until now i had felt afraid of wilson and had obeyed him the mystery of his sudden arrivals his cleverness his deep understanding of me all these things filled me with fear i always obeyed him although i hated myself for doing it but recently i had become a very heavy drinker wine made me feel brave and strong able to fight anybody who tried to stop me at the same time i began to think that wilson was becoming weaker was this really happening or was it just a dream i cannot tell but i do know that my own feelings were becoming more and more violent i began to feel a burning hope soon i would break free from this terrible enemy and never take his orders again one evening in i was in rome and was invited to a big party in the palace of duke di broglio the duke was old and boring but his wife was young and beautiful and not very sensible i had evil plans for her she and i had agreed to meet during the party in a quiet room where we could be alone as i walked from room to room looking for her in the crowds i suddenly felt a hand touch my arm then i heard a whisper in my ears angrily i turned round and saw a man he was wearing the same clothes as i was but his face was covered with a black mask i caught him by his arm stop i shouted i have had enough trouble from you this is the last time you ll follow me anywhere come with me now into the next room if you don t i shall kill you right now here where you stand i took him into a small room nearby and pushed him violently to the floor he got to his feet shakily and stood up against the wall i then closed the door and ordered him to fight for a second he did not move then he silently took out his swood it was a short fight i was wild and excited and felt stronger than i had ever felt before after only a few seconds i pushed him against the wall and plunged my sword into his body again and again at that moment somebody tried to open the door i ran to check that the door was locked and then ran back towards my enemy how can i describe what i saw at that moment during those few seconds when i had turned to the door the room had become strangely different there was now a large mirror at the end of the room i was sure that it had not been there before as i stepped up to the mirror i saw myself walking forward shakily my face white and covered with blood or so i thought but i was wrong it was my enemy wilson who stood before me in his last moments of life his mask and cloak lay on the floor his face was now uncovered and i saw in terror that his face was my own then wilson spoke but no longer in a whisper and i thought i heard my own voice speaking as he said you have won and i have lost but from this moment you too are dead dead to the world to heaven and to hope you lived in me and in my death look in my face which is your own and see how you have murdered yourself the tell tale heart it is true that i had been and i am very nervous but do you really think that i am mad i could see and hear more clearly not less because of the disease my hearing more than anything was excellent i could hear all things things in this world and things in heaven i heard many things things in this world and things in heaven i heard many things in hell too so how can i be mad see how clearly and calmly i can tell my story i cannot explain how the idea first came into my head but once i had thought of the idea i could not forget it i had no reason to do it i was not angry i loved the old man h e had never hurt me in any way i didn t want his gold i think it was his eye yes he had a pale blue eye the eye of a vulture whenever i looked at it my blo od became cold and so very slowly i decided to kill the old man and escape from the eye for ever you are thinking i know that i am mad but madmen are not clever and see how cleverly i prepared my plan every day that week i was so kind to the old man and every night of that week at about midnight i opened his door very very quietly first i put my dark lantern through the opening of the door the lantern was closed and so no light came out of it none at all then slowly very slowly i put my head inside the opening i took sixty long minutes just to put my head inside would a madman have worked so carefully and when my head was inside the room i opened the lantern carefully and a thin ray of light fell onto the vulture eye but the eye was always closed so i could not do the work you see i did not hate the man it was only the eye that i hated on the eighth night i started opening the door even more carefully i was feeling calm and strong there i was opening his door and he did not even know that i was there i almost laughed at the idea and perhaps at that moment he heard me because he suddenly moved in his bed but i did not move away i knew that he could not see the opening of the door so i continued pushing it open slowly and quietly when my head was in the room i tried to open the lantern but my thumb slipped and i made a noise immediately the man sat up in bed and shouted who s there i said nothing for an hour i just stood there without moving and he sat in his bed listening then he made a soft noise a noise which i recognized it was the noise of terror the terror of death i knew the sound because i had made it myself many times in the deep of the night when all the world was asleep i felt sorry for the old man but i laughed silently i knew that he had been awake since the first noise and his fear had grown and grown death had entered his room and now the shadow of deatn lay all around him he could neither see me nor hear me but he could feel my head inside his room i opened the lantern a little and a thin ray of light feel on his eye it was open and as i looked at it i became angry i could see it clearly a horrible pale blue eye that turned my blood cold i could see nothing of the man s face or body just his eye and then i heard a sound hadn t i told you that my hearing was excellent i knew the sound it was the beating of the old man s heart it grew louder and quicker yes louder and louder with every minute the old man s terror must have been very great and now a new terror came to me a neighbour might hear the noise of this beating heart the old man s time had come i opened the lantern fully and ran into the room he shouted once but only once because i pulled him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him for many minutes the heart continued to beat but then it stopped the old man was dead i put my hand on his heart and held it there for many minutes there was no life in him at all now his eye would not trouble me again perhaps you are still thinking that i am mad you will not when i tell you of way i hid the body first i cut it into pieces i cut off the head and the arms and the legs i then took up three boards from the wooden floor and hid the body underneath finally i replaced the wooden boards with great care now no human eye not even hiswould see anything wrong there was nothing to see not even any blood a bowl had caught it all ha ha when i finished it was four o clock and it was still dark there was a knock at the front door calmly because i knew i had nothing to fear i opened the door three policemen came in they had come because a neighbour had reported a loud shout coming from the house i welcomed the policemen and asked them to come in i explained that it was i who had shouted in a dream the old man i said was away in the country i took them round the house and asked them to search it well then i took them to the old man s room and showed them all his things i brought chairs into the room and invited them to sit down and rest a while calmly i put my own chair on the place where i had hidden his body the policemen seemed happy they could see from the way i spoke that all was well they continued talking but i began to get tired my head ached and there was a ringing noise in my ears i wanted the men to go away but they continued to talk the ringing became louder and clearer and then i realized that the noise was not in my ears i became very pale and starting talking more loudly but the noise became louder too what could do it was a low soft sound like the sound made by a watch when it is covered in cotton i spoke more loudly the noise became louder too why oh why didn t the men go away i walked up and down the room i became angry i argued i threw the chair onto the floor but the noise continued to grow louder louder than every noise i made and the men went on talking and smiling was it possible that they hadn t heard the terrible noise no no they heard they knew they were only pretending that they hadn t heard the noise i was sure of this i still am and i hated their smiling faces i felt that i must scream or die and now again the noise was louder louder louder stop i shouted stop pretending that you cannot hear it yes i did it pull up the floorboards here here here it is the beating of his horrible heart little miss mary nobody seemed to care about mary she was born in india where her father was a british official he was busy with his work and her mother who was very beautiful spent all her time going to parties so an indian woman kamala was paid to take care of the little girl mary was not a pretty child she had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair she was always giving orders to kamala who had to obey mary never thought of other people but only of herself in fact she was a very selfish disagreeable bad tempered little girl one very hot morning when she was about nine years old she woke up and saw that instead of kamala there was a different indian servant by her bed what are you doing here she asked crossly go away and send kamala to me at once the woman looked afraid i m sorry miss mary sheshe she can t come something strange was happening that day some of the house servants were missing and everybody looked frightened but nobody told mary anything and kamala still did not come so at last mary went out into the garden and played by herself under a tree she pretended she was making her own flower garden and picked large red flowers to push into the ground all the time she was saying crossly to herself i hate kamala i ll hit her when she comes back just then she saw her mother coming into the garden with a young englishman they did not notice the child who listened to their conversation it s very bad is it her mother asked the young man in a worried voice very bad he answered seriously people are dying like flies it s dangerous to stay in this town you should go to the hills where there s no disease oh i know she cried we must leave soon suddenly they heard loud cries coming from the servants rooms at the side of the house what s happened cried mary s mother wildly i think one of your servants has just died you didn t tell me the disease is here in your house i didn t know she screamed quick come with me and together they ran into the house now mary understood what was wrong the terrible disease had already killed many people in the town and in all the houses people were dying in mary s house it was kamala who had just died later that day three more servants died there all through the night and the next day people ran in and out of the house shouting and crying nobody thought of mary she hid in her bedroom frightened by the strange and terrible sounds that she heard around her sometimes she cried and sometimes she slept when she woke the next day the house was silent perhaps the disease has gone she thought and everybody is well again i wonder who will take care of me instead of kamala why doesn t someone bring me some food it s strange the house is so quiet but just then she heard men s voices in the hall how sad said one that beautiful woman there was a child too wasn t there said the other although none of us ever saw her mary was standing in the middle of her room when they opened the door a few minutes later the two men jumped back in surprise my name is mary lennox she said crossly i was asleep when everyone was ill and now i m hungry it s the child the one nobody ever saw said the older man to the other they ve all forgotten her why was i forgotten asked mary angrily why has nobody come to take care of me the younger man looked at her very sadly poor child he said you see there s nobody left alive in the house so nobody can come in this strange and sudden way mary learnt that both her mother and her father had died the few servants who had not died had run away in the night no one had remembered little miss mary she was all alone because she had never known her parents well she did not miss them at all she only thought of herself as she had always done where will i live she wondered i hope i ll stay with people who ll let me do what i want at first she was taken to an english family who had known her parents she hated their untidy house and noisy children and preferred playing by herself in the garden one day she was playing her favourite game pretending to make a garden when one of the children basil offered to help go away cried mary i don t want your help for a moment basil looked angry and then he began to laugh he danced round and round mary and sang a funny little song about miss mary and her stupid flowers this made mary very cross indeed no one had ever laughed at her so unkindly you re going home soon said basil and we re all very pleased you re leaving i m pleased too replied mary but where s home you re stupid if you don t know that laughed basil england of course you re going to live with your uncle mr archibald graven i ve never heard of him said mary coldly but i know about him because i heard father and mother talking said basil he lives in a big lonely old house and has no friends because he s so badtempered he s got a crooked back and he s horrid i don t believe you cried mary but the next day basil s parents explained that she was going to live with her uncle in yorkshire in the north of england mary looked bored and cross and said nothing after the long sea journey she was met in london by mr craven s housekeeper mrs medlock together they travelled north by train mrs medlock was a large woman with a very red face and bright black eyes mary did not like her but that was not surprising because she did not usually like people mrs medlock did not like mary either what a disagreeable child thought the housekeeper but perhaps i should talk to her i can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like she said aloud he lives in a big old house a long way from anywhere there are nearly a hundred rooms but most of them are shut and locked there s a big park round the house and all kinds of gardens well what do you think of that nothing replied mary it doesn t matter to me mrs medlock laughed you re a hard little girl well if you don t care mr craven doesn t either he never spends time on anyone he s got a crooked back you see and although he s always been rich he was never really happy until he married married repeated mary in surprise yes he married a sweet pretty girl and he loved her deeply so when she died oh did she die asked mary interested yes she did and now he doesn t care about anybody if he s at home he stays in his room and sees nobody he won t want to see you so you must stay out of his way and do what you re told mary stared out of the train window at the grey sky and the rain she was not looking forward to life at her uncle s house the train journey lasted all day and it was dark when they arrived at the station then there was a long drive to get to the house it was a cold windy night and it was raining heavily after a while mary began to hear a strange wild noise she looked out of the window but could see nothing except the darkness what s that noise she asked mrs medlock it s it s not the sea is it no that s the moor it s the sound the wind makes blowing across the moor what is a moor it s just miles and miles of wild land with no trees or houses your uncle s house is right on the edge of the moor mary listened to the strange frightening sound i don t like it she thought i don t like it she looked more disagreeable than ever mary in yorkshire they arrived at a very large old house it looked dark and unfriendly from the outside inside mary looked around the big shadowy hall and felt very small and lost they went straight upstairs mary was shown to a room where there was a warm fire and food on the table this is your room said mrs medlock go to bed when you ve had some supper and remember you must stay in your room mr craven doesn t want you to wander all over the house when mary woke up the next morning she saw a young servant girl cleaning the fireplace the room seemed dark and rather strange with pictures of dogs and horses and ladies on the walls it was not a child s room at all from the window she could not see any trees or houses only wild land which looked like a kind of purple sea who are you she asked the servant coldly martha miss answered the girl with a smile and what s that outside mary continued that s the moor smiled martha do you like it no replied mary immediately i hate it that s because you don t know it you will like it i love it it s lovely in spring and summer when there are flowers it always smells so sweet the air s so fresh and the birds sing so beautifully i never want to leave the moor mary was feeling very badtempered you re a strange servant she said in india we don t have conversations with servants we give orders and they obey and that s that martha did not seem to mind mary s crossness i know i talk too much she laughed are you going to be my servant asked mary well not really i work for mrs medlock i m going to clean your room and bring you your food but you won t need a servant except for those things but who s going to dress me martha stopped cleaning and stared at mary tha canna dress thysen she asked shocked what do you mean i don t understand your language oh i forgot we all speak the yorkshire dialect here but of course you don t understand that i meant to say can t you put on your own clothes of course not my servant always used to dress me well i think you should learn to dress yourself my mother always says people should be able to take care of themselves even if they re rich and important little miss mary was furious with martha it s different in india where i come from you don t know anything about india or about servants or about anything you you she could not explain what she meant suddenly she felt very confused and lonely she threw herself down on the bed and started cryiny wildly now now don t cry like that martha said gently i m very sorry you re right i don t know anything about anything please stop crying miss she sounded kind and friendly and mary began to feel better and soon stopped crying martha went on talking as she finished her cleaning but mary looked out of the window in a bored way and pretended not to listen i ve got eleven brothers and sisters you know miss there s not much money in our house and they all eat so much food mother says it s the good fresh air on the moor that makes them so hungry my brother dickon he s always out on the moor he s twelve and he s got a horse which he rides sometimes where did he get it asked mary she had always wanted an animal of her own and so she began to feel a little interest in dickon oh it s a wild horse but he s a kind boy and animals like him you see now you must have your breakfast miss here it is on the table i don t want it said mary i m not hungry what cried martha my little brothers and sisters would eat all this in five minutes why asked mary coldly because they don t get enough to eat that s why and they re always hungry you re very lucky to have the food miss mary said nothing but she drank some tea and ate a little bread now put a coat on and run outside to play said martha it ll do you good to be in the fresh air mary looked out of the window at the cold grey sky why should i go out on a day like this she asked well there s nothing to play with indoors is there mary realized martha was right but who will go with me she said martha stared at her nobody you ll have to learn to play by yourself dickon plays by himself on the moors for hours with the wild birds and the sheep and the other animals she looked away for a moment perhaps i shouldn t tell you this but but one of the walled gardens is locked up nobody s been in it for ten years it was mrs graven s garden and when she died so suddenly mr craven locked it and buried the keyoh i must go i can hear mrs medlock s bell ringing for me mary went downstairs and wandered through the great empty gardens many of the fruit and vegetable gardens had walls round them but there were no locked doors she saw an old man digging in one of the vegetable gardens but he looked cross and unfriendly so she walked on how ugly it all looks in winter she thought but what a mystery the locked garden is why did my uncle bury the key if he loved his wife why did he hate her garden perhaps i ll never know i don t suppose i ll like him if i ever meet him and he won t like me so i won t be able to ask him just then she noticed a robin singing to her from a tree on the other side of a wall i think that tree s in the secret garden she told herself there s an extra wall here and there s no way in she went back to where the gardener was digging and spoke to him at first he answered in a very badtempered way but suddenly the robin flew down near them and the old man began to smile he looked a different person then and mary thought how much nicer people looked when they smiled the gardener spoke gently to the robin and the pretty little bird hopped on the ground near them he s my friend he is said the old man there aren t any other robins in the garden so he s a bit lonely he spoke in strong yorkshire dialect so mary had to listen carefully to understand him she looked very hard at the robin i m lonely too she said she had not realized this before what s your name she asked the gardener ben weatherstaff i m lonely myself the robin s my only friend you see i haven t got any friends at all said mary yorkshire people always say what they are thinking and old ben was a yorkshire moor man we re alike you and me he told mary we re not pretty to look at and we re both very disagreeable nobody had ever said this to mary before am i really as ugly and disagreeable as ben she wondered suddenly the robin flew to a tree near mary and started singing to her ben laughed loudly well he said he wants to be your friend oh would you please be my friend she whispered to the robin she spoke in a soft quiet voice and old ben looked at her in surprise you said that really nicely he said you sound like dickon when he talks to animals on the moor do you know dickon asked mary but just then the robin flew away oh look he s flown into the garden with no door please ben how can i get into it ben stopped smiling and picked up his spade you can t and that s that it s not your business nobody can find the door run away and play will you i must get on with my work and he walked away he did not even say goodbye in the next few days mary spent almost all her time in the gardens the fresh air from the moor made her hungry and she was becoming stronger and healthier one day she noticed the robin again he was on top of a wall singing to her good morning isn t this fun come this way he seemed to say as he hopped along the wall mary began to laugh as she danced along beside him i know the secret garden s on the other side of this wall she thought excitedly and the robin lives there but where s the door that evening she asked martha to stay and talk to her beside the fire after supper they could hear the wind blowing round the old house but the room was warm and comfortable mary only had one idea in her head tell me about the secret garden she said well all right then miss but we aren t supposed to talk about it you know it was mrs graven s favourite garden and she and mr craven used to take care of it themselves they spent hours there reading and talking very happy they were they used the branch of an old tree as a seat but one day when she was sitting on the branch it broke and she fell she was very badly hurt and the next day she died that s why he hates the garden so much and won t let anyone go in there how sad said mary poor mr craven it was the first time that she had ever felt sorry for anyone just then as she was listening to the wind outside she heard another noise in the house can you hear a child crying she asked martha martha looked confused er no she replied no i think it must be the wind but at that moment the wind blew open their door and they heard the crying very clearly i told you cried mary at once martha shut the door it was the wind she repeated but she did not speak in her usual natural way and mary did not believe her the next day it was very rainy so mary did not go out instead she decided to wander round the house looking into some of the hundred rooms that mrs medlock had told her about she spent all morning going in and out of dark silent rooms which were full of heavy furniture and old pictures she saw no servants at all and was on her way back to her room for lunch when she heard a cry it s a bit like the cry that i heard last night she thought just then the housekeeper mrs medlock appeared with her keys in her hand what are you doing here she asked crossly i didn t know which way to go and i heard someone crying answered mary you didn t hear anything go back to you room now and if you don t stay there i ll lock you in mary hated mrs medlock for this there was someone crying i know there was she said to herself but i ll discover who it is soon she was almost beginning to enjoy herself in yorkshire finding the secret garden when mary woke up two days later the wind and rain had all disappeared and the sky was a beautiful blue spring ll be here soon said martha happily you ll love the moor then when it s full of flowers and birds could i get to the moor asked mary you ve never done much walking have you i don t think you could walk the five miles to our cottage but i d like to meet your family mary said martha looked at the little girl for a moment she remembered how disagreeable mary had been when she first arrived but now mary looked interested and friendly i ll ask mother said martha she can always think of a good plan she s sensible and hardworking and kindi know you ll like her i like dickon although i ve never seen him i wonder what dickon will think of you he won t like me said mary no one does but do you like yourself that s what mother would ask no not really i ve never thought of that well i must go now it s my day off so i m going home to help mother with the housework goodbye miss see you tomorrow mary felt lonelier than ever when martha had gone so she went outside the sunshine made the gardens look different and the change in the weather had even made ben weatherstaff easier to talk to can you smell spring in the air he asked her things are growing deep down in the ground soon you ll see little green shoots coming up young plants they are you watch them i will replied mary oh there s the robin the little bird hopped on to ben s spade are things growing in the garden where he lives what garden said ben in his badtempered voice you know the secret garden are the flowers dead there she really wanted to know the answer ask the robin said ben crossly he s the only one who s been in there for the last ten years ten years was a long time mary thought she had been born ten years ago she walked away thinking she had begun to like the gardens and the robin and martha and dickon and their mother before she came to yorkshire she had not liked anybody she was walking beside the long wall of the secret garden when a most wonderful thing happened she suddenly realized the robin was following her she felt very pleased and excited by this and cried out you like me don t you and i like you too as he hopped along beside her she hopped and sang too to show him that she was his friend just then he stopped at a place where a dog had dug a hole in the ground as mary looked at the hole she noticed something almost buried there she put her hand in and pulled it out it was an old key perhaps it s been buried for ten years she whispered to herself perhaps it s the key to the secret garden she looked at it for a long time how lovely it would be to find the garden and see what had happened to it in the last ten years she could play in it all by herself and nobody would know she was there she put the key safely in her pocket the next morning martha was back at misselthwaite manor and told mary all about her day with her family i really enjoyed myself i helped mother with the whole week s washing and baking and i told the children about you they wanted to know about your servants and the ship that brought you to england and everything i can tell you some more for next time offered mary they d like to hear about riding on elephants and camels wouldn t they oh that would be kind of you miss and look mother has sent you a present a present repeated mary how could a family of fourteen hungry people give anyone a present mother bought it from a man who came to the door to sell things she told me martha you ve brought me your pay like a good girl and we need it all but i m going to buy something for that lonely child at the manor and she bought one and here it is it was a skippingrope mary stared at it what is it she asked don t they have skippingropes in india well this is how you use it just watch me martha took the rope and ran into the middle of the room she counted up to a hundred as she skipped that looks lovely said mary your mother is very kind do you think i could ever skip like that just try said martha mother says it ll make you strong and healthy skip outside in the fresh air mary put her coat on and took the skipping rope as she was opening the door she thought of something and turned round martha it was your money really thank you she never thanked people usually and she did not know how to do it so she held out her hand because she knew that adults did that martha shook her hand and laughed you re a strange child she said like an old woman now run away and play the skippingrope was wonderful mary counted and skipped skipped and counted until her face was hot and red she was having more fun than she had ever had before she skipped through the gardens until she found ben weatherstaff who was digging and talking to his robin she wanted them both to see her skip well said ben you re looking fine and healthy today go on skipping it s good for you mary skipped all the way to the secret garden wall and there was the robin he had followed her mary was very pleased you showed me where the key was yesterday she laughed i ve got it in my pocket so you ought to show me the door today the robin hopped on to an old climbing plant on the wall and sang his most beautiful song suddenly the wind made the plant move and mary saw something under the dark green leaves the thick heavy plant was covering a door mary s heart was beating fast and her hands were shaking as she pushed the leaves away and found the keyhole she took the key out of her pocket and it fitted the hole using both hands she managed to unlock the door then she turned round to see if anyone was watching but there was no one so she pushed the door which opened slowly for the first time in ten years she walked quickly in and shut the door behind her at last she was inside the secret garden it was the loveliest most exciting place she had ever seen there were old rose trees everywhere and the walls were covered with climbing roses she looked carefully at the grey branches were the roses still alive ben would know she hoped they weren t all dead but she was inside the wonderful garden in a world of her own it seemed very strange and silent but she did not feel lonely at all then she noticed some small green shoots coming up through the grass so something was growing in the garden after all when she found a lot more shoots in different places she decided they needed more air and light so she began to pull out the thick grass around them she worked away clearing the ground for two or three hours and had to take her coat off because she got so hot the robin hopped around pleased to see someone gardening she almost forgot about lunch and when she arrived back in her room she was very hungry and ate twice as much as usual martha she said as she was eating i ve been thinking this is a big lonely house and there isn t much for me to do do you think if i buy a little spade i can make my own garden that s just what mother said replied martha you d enjoy digging and watching plants growing dickon can get you a spade and some seeds to plant if you like oh thank you martha i ve got some money that mrs medlock gave me will you write and ask dickon to buy them for me i will and he ll bring them to you himself oh then i ll see him mary looked very excited then she remembered something i heard that cry in the house again martha it wasn t the wind this time i ve heard it three times now who is it martha looked uncomfortable you mustn t go wandering around the house you know mr craven wouldn t like it now i must go and help the others downstairs i ll see you at teatime as the door closed behind martha mary thought to herself this really is the strangest house that anyone ever lived in meeting dickon mary spent nearly a week working in the secret garden each day she found new shoots coming out of the ground soon there would be flowers everywhere thousands of them it was an exciting game to her when she was inside those beautiful old walls no one knew where she was during that week she became more friendly with ben who was often digging in one of the vegetable gardens what are your favourite flowers ben she asked him one day roses i used to work for a young lady who loved roses you see and she had a lot in her garden that was ten years ago but she died very sad it was what happened to the roses asked mary they were left there in the garden if rose branches look dry and grey are they still alive asked mary it was so important to know in the spring they ll show green shoots and then but why are you so interested in roses he asked mary s face went red i just wanted to pretend i ve got a garden i haven t got anyone to play with well that s true said ben he seemed to feel sorry for her mary decided she liked old ben although he was sometimes badtempered she skipped along and into the wood at the end of the gardens suddenly she heard a strange noise and there in front of her was a boy he was sitting under a tree playing on a wooden pipe he was about twelve with a healthy red face and bright blue eyes there was a squirrel and a crow in the tree and two rabbits sitting on the grass near him they re listening to the music thought mary i mustn t frighten them she stood very still the boy stopped playing that s right he said animals don t like it if you move suddenly i m dickon and you must be miss mary i ve brought you the spade and the seeds he spoke in an easy friendly way mary liked him at once as they were looking at the seed packets together the robin hopped on to a branch near them dickon listened carefully to the robin s song he s saying he s your friend he told mary really oh i am pleased he likes me can you understand everything that birds say i think i do and they think i do i ve lived on the moor with them for so long sometimes i think i am a bird or an animal not a boy at all his smile was the widest she had ever seen he explained how to plant the seeds suddenly he said i can help you plant them where s your garden mary went red then white she had never thougt of this what was she going to say could you keep a secret it s a great secret if anyone discovers it i ll i ll die i keep secrets for all the wild birds and animals on the moor so i can keep yours too he replied i ve stolen a garden she said very fast nobody goes into it nobody wants it i love it and nobody takes care of it they re letting it die and she threw her arms over her face and started crying don t cry said dickon gently where is it come with me and i ll show you said miss mary they went to the secret garden and entered it together dickon walked round looking at everything martha told me about this place but i never thought i d see it he said it s wonderful what about the roses asked mary worriedly are they still alive what do you think look at these shoots on the branches most of them are alive all right he took out his knife and cut away some of the dead wood from the rose trees mary showed him the work she had done in the garden and they talked as they cut and cleared dickon said mary suddenly i like you i never thought i d like as many as five people only five laughed dickon he did look funny when he laughed thought mary yes your mother martha the robin ben and you then she asked him a question in yorkshire dialect because that was his language does tha like me was her question of course i likes thee wonderful replied dickon a big smile on his round face mary had never been so happy when she went back to the house for her lunch she told martha about dickon s visit i ve got news for you too said martha mr craven s come home and wants to see you he s going away again tomorrow for several months oh said mary that was good news she would have all summer in the secret garden before he came back but she must be careful he mustn t guess her secret now just then mrs medlock arrived in her best black dress to take mary down to mr craven s room mary s uncle had black hair with some white in it and high crooked shoulders his face was not ugly but very sad during their conversation he watched her in a worried way perhaps he was thinking of other things at the same time he looked at the thin child are you well he asked mary tried to keep her voice calm as she replied i m getting stronger and healthier what do you want to do in this big empty house i i just want to play outside i enjoy that yes martha s mother susan sowerby spoke to me the other day she s a sensible woman and she said you needed fresh air but where do you play everywhere i just skip and runand look for green shoots i don t damage anything don t look so frightened of course a child like you couldn t damage anything play where you like is there anything that you want mary came a step nearer to him and her voice shook a little as she spoke could icould i have a bit of garden mr craven looked very surprised to plant seeds in to make them come alive mary went on bravely it was too hot in india so i was always ill and tired there but here it s different i i love the garden he passed a hand quickly over his eyes then he looked kindly at mary i knew someone once who loved growing things like you yes child take as much of the garden as you want he smiled gently at her now leave me i m very tired mary ran all the way back to her room martha she shouted mr graven s really a nice man but he looks very unhappy he said i can have my own garden she was planning to work in the garden with dickon every day to make it beautiful for the summer meeting colin in the middle of the night mary woke up heavy rain had started falling again and the wind was blowing violently round the walls of the old house suddenly she heard crying again this time she decided to discover who it was she left her room and in the darkness followed the crying sound round corners and through doors up and down stairs to the other side of the big house at last she found the right room she pushed the door open and went in it was a big room with beautiful old furniture and pictures in the large bed was a boy who looked tired and cross with a thin white tearful face he stared at mary who are you he whispered are you a dream no i m not i m mary lennox mr craven s my uncle he s my father said the boy i m colin craven no one ever told me he had a son said mary very surprised well no one ever told me you d come to live here i m ill you see i don t want people to see me and talk about me if i live i may have a crooked back like my father but i ll probably die what a strange house this is said mary so many secrets does your father come and see you often not often he doesn t like seeing me because it makes him remember my mother she died when i was born so he almost hates me i think why do you say you re going to die asked mary i ve always been ill i ve nearly died several times and my back s never been strong my doctor feels sure that i m going to die but he s my father s cousin and verv poor so he d like me to die then he d get all the money when my father dies he gives me medicine and tells me to rest we had a grand doctor from london once who told me to go out in the fresh air and try to get well but i hate fresh air and another thing all the servants have to do what i want because if i m angry i become ill mary thought she liked this boy although he seemed so strange he asked her lots of questions and she told him all about her life in india how old are you he asked suddenly i m ten and so are you replied mary forgetting to be careful because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried and i know that was ten years ago colin sat up in bed and looked very interested what door who locked it where s the key i want to see it i ll make the servants tell me where it is they ll take me there and you can come too oh please don tdon t do that cried mary colin stared at her don t you want to see it yes but if you make them open the door it will never be a secret again you see if only we know about it if weif we can find the key we can go and play there every day we can help the garden come alive again and no one will know about itexcept us i see said colin slowly yes i d like that it ll be our secret i ve never had a secret before and perhaps added mary cleverly we can find a boy to push you in your wheelchair if you can t walk and we can go there together without any other people you ll feel better outside i know i do i d like that he said dreamily i think i d like fresh air in a secret garden then mary told him about the moor and dickon and ben weatherstaff and the robin and golin listened to it all with great interest he began to smile and look much happier i like having you here he said you must come and see me every day but i m tired now i ll sing you a song my servant kamala used to do that in india said mary and very soon colin was asleep the next afternoon mary visited colin again and he seemed very pleased to see her he had sent his nurse away and had told nobody about mary s visit mary had not told anybody either they read some of his books together and told each other stories they were enjoying themselves and laughing loudly when suddenly the door opened dr craven and mrs medlock came in they almost fell over in surprise what s happening here asked dr craven colin sat up straight to mary he looked just like an indian prince this is my cousin mary lennox he said calmly i like her she must visit me often oh i m sorry sir said poor mrs medlock to the doctor i don t know how she discovered him i told the servants to keep it a secret don t be stupid medlock said the indian prince coldly nobody told her she heard me crying and found me herself bring our tea up now i m afraid you re getting too hot and excited my boy said dr craven that s not good for you don t forget you re ill i want to forget said colin i ll be angry if mary doesn t visit me she makes me feel better dr craven did not look happy when he left the room what a change in the boy sir said the housekeeper he s usually so disagreeable with all of us he really seems to like that strange little girl and he does look better dr craven had to agree colin is afraid because it rained all the next week mary went to talk to colin every day instead of visiting the garden but she woke early one morning to see the sun shining into her room and she ran out to the secret garden at once she did not even wait to have her breakfast it was beautifully sunny and warm and a thousand more shoots were pushing their way out of the ground dickon was already there digging hard with the crow and a young fox beside him have you seen the robin he asked mary the little bird was flying busily backwards and forwards as fast as he could carrying pieces of dry grass he s building a nest whispered mary they watched the robin for a moment then mary said i must tell you something you probably know about colin craven don t you well i ve met him and i m going to help him to get better that s good news there was a big smile on dickon s honest face we all knew he was ill he s afraid he ll have a crooked back like his father i think that s what s making him ill perhaps we can bring him here and let him rest under the trees that ll do him good that s what we ll do they had a lot of gardening and planning to do and mary did not have time to visit colin that day when she came back to the house in the evening martha told her that the servants had had trouble with colin he s been very badtempered all afternoon with all of us because you didn t come miss well i was busy he ll have to learn not to be so selfish replied mary coldly she forgot how selfish she had been when she was ill in india i ll go and see him now when she went into his room he was lying in bed looking tired he did not turn to look at her what s the matter with you she asked crossly my back aches and my head hurts why dldn t you come this afternoon i was working in the garden with dickon i won t let that boy come to the garden if you stay with him instead of talking to me mary suddenly became very angry if you send dickon away i ll never come into this room again you ll have to if i say so i ll make the servants bring you in here oh will you prince but no one can make me talk to you i won t look at you i ll stare at the floor you selfish girl cried colin you re more selfish than i am you re the most selfish boy i ve ever met i m not as selfish as your fine dickon he keeps you playing outside when he knows i m ill and alone mary had never been so furious dickon is nicer than any other boy in the world he s like an angel an angel don t make me laugh he s just a poor country boy with holes in his shoes he s a thousand times better than you are colin had never argued with anyone like himself in his life and in fact it was good for him but now he was beginning to feel sorry for himself i m always ill he said and started to cry i m sure my back is a bit crooked and i m going to die no you re not said mary crossly colin opened his eyes very wide nobody had said that to him before he was angry but a bit pleased at the same time what do you mean you know i m going to die everybody says i m going to die i don t believe it said mary in her most disagreeable voice you just say that to make people feel sorry for you you re too horrid to die colin forgot about his painful back and sat up in bed get out of the room at once he shouted and threw a book at her i m going mary shouted in reply and i won t come back the door banged shut behind her when she reached her own room she had decided never to tell him her great secret he can stay in his room and die if he wants she thought but soon she began to remember how ill he had been and how frightened he was frightened that one day his back would become as crooked as his father s perhaps perhaps i ll go back and see him tomorrow that night she was woken by the most terrible screams that she had ever heard servants were opening and shutting doors and running about it s colin thought mary he ll go on screaming until he makes himself really ill how selfish he is somebody should stop him just then martha ran into the room we don t know what to do she cried he likes you miss come and see if you can make him calmer please well i m very cross with him said mary and jumped out of bed i m going to stop him that s right said martha he needs someone like you to argue with it ll give him something new to think about mary ran into colin s room right up to his bed stop screaming she shouted furiously stop at once i hate you everybody hates you you ll die if you go on screaming like this and i hope you will the screams stopped immediately this was the first time that anyone had spoken so angrily to colin and he was shocked but he went on crying quietly to himself my back s becoming crooked i can feel it i know i m going to die large tears ran down his face don t be stupid cried mary there s nothing the matter with your horrid back martha come here and help me look at his back martha and mrs medlock were standing at the door staring at mary their mouths half open they both looked very frightened martha came forward to help and miss mary looked carefully at colin s thin white back up and down her face was serious and angry at the same time the room was very quiet there s nothing wrong with your back she said at last nothing at all it s as straight as mine only colin knew how important those crossly spoken childish words were all his life he had been afraid to ask about his back and his terrible fear had made him ill now an angry little girl told him his back was straight and he believed her he was no longer afraid they were both calmer now he gave mary his hand i thinki m almost sure i will live if we can go out in the garden together sometimes i m very tired now will you stay with me until i go to sleep the servants went out very quietly i ll tell you all about the secret garden whispered mary i think it s full of roses and beautiful flowers birds like making their nests there because it s so quiet and safe and perhaps our robin but colin was already asleep the next day mary met dickon as usual in the secret garden and told him about colin mary loved dickon s yorkshire dialect and was trying to learn it herself she spoke a little now we mun get poor colin out here in th sunshine an we munnot lose no time about it dickon laughed well done i didn t know you could speak yorkshire you re right we must bring colin to the garden as soon as we can so that afternoon she went to see colin i m sorry i said i d send dickon away he said i hated you when you said he was like an angel well he s a funny kind of angel but he understands wild animals better than anyone suddenly mary knew that this was the right moment to tell him she caught hold of his hands colin this is important can you keep a secret yes yes he whispered excitedly what is it we ve found the door into the secret garden oh mary will i live long enough to see it of course you will don t be stupid said mary crossly but it was a very natural thing to say and they both laughed colin told mrs medlock and the doctor that he wanted to go out in his wheelchair at first the doctor was worried the boy would get too tired but when he heard that dickon would push the wheelchair he agreed dickon s a sensible boy he told colin but don t forget i ve told you i want to forget that i m ill said colin in his prince s voice don t you understand it s because my cousin makes me forget that i feel better when i m with her colin and the garden of course it was most important that no one should see colin mary or dickon entering the secret garden so colin gave orders to the gardeners that they must all keep away from that part of the garden in future the next afternoon colin was carried downstairs by a man servant and put in his wheelchair outside the front door dickon arrived with his crow two squirrels and the fox and started pushing the wheelchair gently away from the house and into the gardens mary walked beside the chair spring had really arrived now and it seemed very exciting to colin who had lived indoors for so long he smelt the warm air from the moor and watched the little white clouds in the blue sky in a very short time he heard mary say this is where i found the key and this is the door and this this is the secret garden colin covered his eyes with his hands until he was inside the four high walls and the door was shut again then he looked round at the roses climbing the old red walls the pink and white flowers on the fruit trees and the birds and the butterflies everywhere the sun warmed his face and he suddenly knew he felt different mary dickon he cried i m going to get better i m going to live for ever and ever and ever as dickon pushed the wheelchair all round the garden he told colin the names of all the plants the sun shone the birds sang and in every corner of the garden there was something interesting to look at the three children talked and laughed and by the end of the afternoon all three were speaking yorkshire together i ll come back here every afternoon said colin i want to watch things growing soon you ll be strong enough to walk and dig you ll be able to help us with the gardening said dickon kindly do you really think i ll be able to to walk and dig asked colin of course you will you ve got legs like us but they re not very strong answered colin they shake and and i m afraid to stand on them when you want to use them you ll be able to said dickon the garden was quiet for a moment suddenly colin said who s that mary turned her head and noticed ben weatherstaff s angry face looking at her over the garden wall what are you doing in that garden young miss he shouted he had not seen colin or dickon the robin showed me the way ben she replied you you he stopped shouting and his mouth dropped open as he saw dickon pushing a boy in a wheelchair over the grass towards him do you know who i am asked the boy in the chair old ben stared you ve got your mother s eyes he said in a shaking voice yes i know you you re mr craven s son the little boy with the crooked back colin forgot that he had ever had backache my back s as straight as yours is he shouted ben stared and stared he only knew what he had heard from the servants you haven t got a crooked back he asked or crooked legs that was too much colin was furious and it made him feel strong come here dickon he shouted and threw off his blanket dickon was by his side in a second mary felt sick with fear could colin stand then colin s thin feet were on the grass and he was standing holding dickon s arm he looked strangely tall and he held his head very high look at me he shouted at ben just look at me he s as straight as any boy in yorkshire said dickon tears were running down ben s brown old face they said you were going to die he whispered well you can see that s not true said colin now get down from the wall and come here i want to talk to you you ve got to help us keep the garden a secret yes sir said old ben as he dried his eyes that was the first of many beautiful afternoons in the secret garden colin was brought there by dickon and mary nearly every day and he saw all the changes that happened there during the spring and early summer ben weatherstaff now in the secret joined them as often as he could one day colin spoke to all of them listen everybody i think there s something like magic that makes gardens grow and things happen perhaps if i believe in it the magic will make me strong let s all sit down in a circle and ask the magic to work so they all sat on the grass in a circle dickon with his crow his fox and the two squirrels mary colin and ben colin repeated these words several times the sun s shining that s the magic being strong that s the magic magic help me magic help me at last colin stopped now i m going to walk round the garden he said and took dickon s arm slowly he walked from one wall to another followed closely by mary and ben and when he had walked all the way round he said you see i can walk now the magic worked it s wonderful cried mary your father will think he is dreaming when he sees you i won t tell him yet i m going to keep it a secret from everybody i ll come to the garden and walk and run a little more every day until i m as healthy as any other boy then when my father comes home i ll walk up to him and say here i am father you see i m not going to die now began a difficult time for colin and mary dickon told his mother about it one evening as he was digging the cottage garden you see mother they don t want the doctor or the servants to guess that colin can walk and is getting better so they have to pretend he s still ill and just as disagreeable as he used to be if they re running about all day in the fresh air that ll make them hungry i should think yes that s the problem they re both getting fatter and healthier and they really enjoy their food now but they have to send some of it back to the kitchen uneaten if they eat it all people will realize how healthy they are sometimes they re very hungry i know what we can do said mrs sowerby you can take some fresh milk and some of my newly baked bread to the garden in the mornings if they have that it ll do them a lot of good what a game those children are playing and she laughed until tears came to her eyes one afternoon when they were all working in the garden the door opened and a woman came quietly in it s mother cried dickon and ran towards her i told her where the door was because i knew she would keep the secret colin held out his hand to her i ve wanted to see you for a long time he said dear boy susan sowerby whispered holding his hand you re so like your mother do you think asked colin carefully that will make my father like me i m sure it will she answered warmly he must see you he must come home now you see how healthy the boy is susan asked old ben look how strong and straight his legs are now yes she laughed playing and working outside and eating good yorkshire food has made him strong and miss mary too she added turning to mary mrs medlock heard that your mother was a pretty woman you ll soon be as pretty as she was do you believe in magic colin asked her i do she answered but everybody gives it a different name it makes the sun shine and the seeds grow and it has made you healthy she sat down on the grass and stayed for a while talking and laughing with the children in the quiet sunny garden when she stood up to leave colin suddenly put out a hand to her i wish you were my mother he whispered mrs sowerby put her arms round him and held him to her dear boy you re as close to your mother as you could be here in her garden and your father ll come back soon mr craven comes home while the secret garden was returning to life a man with high crooked shoulders was wandering round the most beautiful places in europe for ten years he had lived this lonely life his heart full of sadness and his head full of dark dreams everywhere he went he carried his unhappiness with him like a black cloud other travellers thought he was half mad or a man who could not forget some terrible crime his name was archibald craven but one day as he sat by a mountain stream he actually looked at a flower and for the first time in ten years he realized how beautiful something living could be the valley seemed very quiet as he sat there staring at the flower he felt strangely calm what is happening to me he whispered i feel different i almost feel i m alive again at that moment hundreds of miles away in yorkshire colin was seeing the secret garden for the first time and saying i m going to live for ever and ever and ever but mr craven did not know this that night in his hotel room he slept better than usual as the weeks passed he even began to think a little about his home and his son one evening in late summer as he was sitting quietly beside a lake he felt the strange calmness again he fell asleep and had a dream that seemed very real he heard a voice calling him it was sweet and clear and happy the voice of his young wife archie archie archie my dear he jumped up where are you in the garden called the beautiful voice and then the dream ended in the morning when he woke he remembered the dream she says she s in the garden he thought but the door s locked and the key s buried that morning he received a letter from susan sowerby in it she asked him to come home but she did not give a reason mr craven thought of his dream and decided to return to england immediately on the long journey back to yorkshire he was thinking about colin i wonder how he is i wanted to forget him because he makes me think of his mother he lived and she died but perhaps i ve been wrong susan sowerby says i should go home so perhaps she thinks i can help him when he arrived home he found the housekeeper very confused about colin s health he s very strange sir said mrs medlock he looks better it s true but some days he eats nothing at all and other days he eats just like a healthy boy he used to scream even at the idea of fresh air but now he spends all his time outside in his wheelchair with miss mary and dickon sowerby he s in the garden at the moment in the garden repeated mr craven those were the words of the dream he hurried out of the house and towards the place which he had not visited for so long he found the door with the climbing plant over it and stood outside listening for a moment surely i can hear voices inside the garden he thought aren t there children whispering laughing running in there or am i going mad and then the moment came when the children could not stay quiet there was wild laughing and shouting and the door was thrown open a boy ran out a tall healthy handsome boy straight into the man s arms mr craven stared into the boy s laughing eyes who what who he cried colin had not planned to meet his father like this but perhaps this was the best way to come running out with his cousin and his friend father he said i m colin you can t believe it i can t believe it myself it was the garden and mary and dickon and the magic that made me well we ve kept it a secret up to now aren t you happy father i m going to live for ever and ever and ever mr craven put his hands on the boy s shoulders for a moment he could not speak take me into the garden my boy he said at last and tell me all about it and in the secret garden where the roses were at their best and the butterflies were flying from flower to flower in the summer sunshine they told colin s father their story sometimes he laughed and sometimes he cried but most of the time he just looked unbelieving into the handsome face of the son that he had almost forgotten now said colin at the end it isn t a secret any more i ll never use the wheelchair again i m going to walk back with you fatherto the house and so that afternoon mrs medlock martha and the other servants had the greatest shock of their lives through the gardens towards the house came mr craven looking happier than they had ever seen him and by his side with his shoulders straight his head held high and a smile on his lips walked young colin txtba www txtba com to the north buck did not read the newspapers he did not know that trouble was coming for every big dog in california men had found gold in the yukon and these men wanted big strong dogs to work in the cold and snow of the north buck lived in mr miller s big house in the sunny santa clara valley there were large gardens and fields of fruit trees around the house and a river nearby in a big place like this of course there were many dogs there were house dogs and farm dogs but they were not important buck was chief dog he was born here and this was his place he was four years old and weighed sixty kilos he went swimming with mr miller s sons and walking with his daughters he carried the grandchildren on his back and he sat at mr miller s feet in front of the fire in winter but this was and buck did not know that men and dogs were hurrying to north west canada to look for gold and he did not know that manuel one of mr miller s garden ers needed money for his large family one day when mr miller was out manuel and buck left the garden together it was just an evening walk buck thought no one saw them go and only one man saw them arrive at the railway station this man talked to manuel and gave him some money then he tied a piece of rope around buck s neck buck growled and was surprised when the rope was pulled hard around his neck he jumped at the man the man caught him and suddenly buck was on his back with his tongue out of his mouth for a few moments he was unable to move and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train when buck woke up the train was still moving the man was sitting and watching him but buck was too quick for him and he bit the man s hand hard then the rope was pulled again and buck had to let go that evening the man took buck to the back room of a bar in san francisco the barman looked at the man s hand and trousers covered in blood how much are they paying you for this he asked i only get fifty dollars and the man who stole him how much did he get asked the barman a hundred he wouldn t take less that makes a hundred and fifty it s a good price for a dog like him here help me to get him into this they took off buck s rope and pushed him into a wooden box he spent the night in the box in the back room of the bar his neck still ached with pain from the rope and he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men and where was mr miller the next day buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train to the north for two days and nights the train travelled north and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank men on the train laughed at him and pushed sticks at him through the holes in the box for two days and nights buck got angrier and hungrier and thirsti er his eyes grew red and he bit anything that moved in seattle four men took buck to a small high walled back garden where a fat man in an old red coat was waiting buck was now very angry indeed and hejumped and bit at the sides of his box the fat man smiled and went to get an axe and a club are you going to take him out now asked one of the men of course answered the fat man and he began to break the box with his axe immediately the four other men climbed up onto the wall to watch from a safe place as the fat man hit the box with his axe buck jumped at the sides growling and biting pulling with his teeth at the pieces of broken wood after a few minutes there was a hole big enough for buck to get out now come here red eyes said the fat man dropping his axe and taking the club in his right hand buck jumped at the man sixty kilos of anger his mouth wide open ready to bite the man s neck just before his teeth touched the skin the man hit him with the club buck fell to the ground it was the first time anyone had hit him with a club and he did not understand he stood up and jumped again again the club hit him and he crashed to the ground ten times he jumped at the man and ten times the club hit him slowly he got to his feet now only just able to stand there was blood on his nose and mouth and ears then the fat man walked up and hit him again very hard on the nose the pain was terrible again buck jumped at the man and again he was hit to the ground a last time he jumped and this time when the man knocked him down buck did not move he knows how to teach a dog a lesson said one of the men on the wall then the four men jumped down and went back to the station his name is buck said the fat man to himself reading the letter that had come with the box well buck my by he said in a friendly voice we ve argued a little and i think the best thing to do now is to stop be a good dog and we ll be friends but if you re a bad dog i ll have to use my club again understand as he spoke he touched buck s head and although buck was angry inside he did not move when the man brought him water and meat buck drank and then ate the meat piece by piece from the man s hand buck was beaten he knew that but he was not broken he had learnt that a man with a club was stronger than him every day he saw more dogs arrive and each dog was beaten by the fat man buck understood that a man with a club must be obeyed although he did not have to be a friend men came to see the fat man and to look at the dogs some times they paid money and left with one or more of the dogs one day a short dark man came and looked at buck that s a good dog he cried how much do you want for him three hundred dollars it s a good price perrault said the fat man perrault smiled and agreed that it was a good price he knew dogs and he knew that buck was an excellent dog one in ten thousand perrault said to himself buck saw money put into the fat man s hand and he was not surprised when he and another dog called curly were taken away by perrault he took them to a ship and later that day buck and curly stood and watched the coast get further and further away they had seen the warm south for the last time perrault took buck and curly down to the bottom of the ship there they met another man francois perrault was a french canadian but francois was half indian tall and dark buck learnt quickly that perrault and francois were fair men calm and honest and they knew everything about dogs there were two other dogs on the ship one was a big dog called spitz as white as snow he was friendly to buck at first always smiling he was smiling when he tried to steal buck s food at the first meal francois was quick and hit spitz before buck had time to move buck decided that this was fair and began to like francois a little dave the other dog was not friendly he wanted to be alone all the time he ate and slept and was interested in nothing one day was very like another but buck noticed that the weather was getting colder one morning the ship s engines stopped and there was a feeling of excitement in the ship francois leashed the dogs and took them outside at the first step buck s feet went into something soft and white he jumped back in surprise the soft white thing was also falling through the air and it fell onto him he tried to smell it and then caught some on his tongue it bit like fire and then dis appeared he tried again and the same thing happened people were watching him and laughing and buck felt ashamed although he did not know why it was his first snow the law of club and tooth buck s first day at dyea beach was terrible every hour there was some new frightening surprise there was no peace no rest only continual noise and movement and every minute there was danger because these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they knew only the law of club and tooth buck had never seen dogs fight like these dogs they were like wolves in a few minutes he learnt this from watching curly she tried to make friends with a dog a big one al though not as big as she was there was no warning the dog jumped on curly his teeth closed together then he jumped away and curly s face was torn open from eye to mouth wolves fight like this biting and jumping away but the fight did not finish then thirty or forty more dogs ran up and made a circle around the fight watching silently curly tried to attack the dog who had bitten her he bit her a second time and jumped away when she attacked him again he knocked her backwards and she fell on the ground she never stood up again because this was what the other dogs were waiting for they moved in and in a moment she was under a crowd of dogs it was all very sudden buck saw spitz run out from the crowd with his tongue out of his mouth laughing then he saw francois with an axe and two or three other men with clubs jump in among the dogs two minutes later the last of the dogs was chased away but curly lay dead in the snow her body torn almost to pieces curly s death often came backto buck in his dreams he understood that once a dog was down on the ground he was dead he also remembered spitz laughing and from that moment he hated him then buck had another surprise francois put a harness on him buck had seen harnesses on horses and now he was made to work like a horse pulling francois on a sledge into the forest and returning with wood for the fire buck worked with spitz and dave the two other dogs had worked in a har ness before and buck learnt by watching them he also learnt to stop and turn when francois shouted those three are very good dogs francois told perrault that buck pulls very well and he s learning quickly perrault had important letters and official papers to take to dawson city so that afternoon he bought two more dogs two brothers called billee and joe billee was very friendly but joe was the opposite in the evening perrault bought one more dog an old dog with one eye his name was sol leks which means the angry one like dave he made no friends all he wanted was to be alone that night buck discovered another problem where was he going to sleep francois and perrault were in their tent but when he went in they shouted angrily and threw things at him outside it was very cold and windy he lay down in the snow but he was too cold to sleep he walked around the tents trying to find the other dogs but to his surprise they had disappeared he walked around perrault s tent very very cold wondering what to do sud denly the snow under his feet fell in and he felt something move he jumped back waiting for the attack but heard on ly a friendly bark there in a warm hole under the snow was billee so that was what you had to do buck chose a place dug himself a hole and in a minute he was warm and asleep he slept well although his dreams were bad when he woke up at first he did not know where he was it had snowed in the night and the snow now lay thick and heavy above him suddenly he was afraid the fear of a wild animal when it is caught and cannot escape growling he threw himself at the snow and a moment later he had jumped upwards into the daylight he saw the tents and re membered everything from the time he had gone for a walk with manuel to the moment he had dug the hole the night before what did i say shouted francois to perrault when he saw buck come up out of the snow that buck learns quickly perrault smiled slowly he was carrying important papers and he needed good dogs he was very pleased to have buck they bought three more dogs that morning and a quarter of an hour later all nine dogs were in harness and on their way up the dyea canyon buck was not sorry to be moving and although it was hard work he almost enjoyed it he was also surprised to see that dave and sol leks no longer looked bored and miserable pulling in a harness was their job and they were happy to do it dave was sledge dog the dog nearest to the sledge in front of him was buck then came sol leks in front of them were the six other dogs with spitz as leader at the front francois had put buck between dave and sol leks because they could teach him the work buck learnt well and they were good teachers when buck pulled the wrong way dave always bit his leg but only lightly once when they stopped buck got tied up in his harness and it took ten minutes to get started again both dave and sol leks gave him a good beating for that mistake buck understood and was more careful after that it was a hard day s journey up the dyea canyon and into the mountains they camped that night at lake bennett here there were thousands of gold miners they were building boats to sail up the lake when the ice melted in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept well but was woken up very early and harnessed to the sledge the first day they had travelled on snow that had been hardened by many sledges and they covered sixty kilometres but the next day and for days afterwards they were on new snow the work was harder and they went slowly usually perrault went in front on snowshoes flattening the snow a little for the dogs francois stayed by the sledge sometimes the two men changed places but there were many small lakes and rivers and perrault understood ice better he always knew when the ice across a river was very thin day after day buck pulled in his harness they started in the morning before it was light and they stopped in the evening after dark ate a piece of fish and went to sleep in their holes under the snow buck was always hungry francoisgave him grams of dried fish a day and it was never enough the other dogs were given only grams they were smaller and could stay dive on less food buck learnt to eat quickly if he was too slow the other dogs stole his food he saw pike one of the new dogs steal some meat from the sledge when perrault wasn t looking the next day buck stole some and got away unseen perrault was very angry but he thought another dog dub had taken it and so punished him instead of buck buck was learning how to live in the north in the south he had never stolen but there he had never been so hungry he stole cleverly and secretly remembering the beatings from the man with the club buck was learning the law of club and tooth he learnt to eat any food anything that he could get his teeth into he learnt to break the ice on water holes with his feet when he wanted to drink he was stronger harder and could see and smell better than ever before in a way he was remembering back to the days when wild dogs travelled in packs through the forest killing for meat as they went it was easy for him to learn to fight like a wolf because it was in his blood in the evenings when he pointed his nose at the moon and howled long and loud he was remembering the dogs and wolves that had come before him the wild animal the wild animal was strong in buck and as he travelled across the snow it grew stronger and stronger and as buck grew stronger he hated spitz more and more although he was careful never to start a fight but spitz was always showing his teeth to buck trying to start a fight and buck knew that if he and spitz fought one of them would die the fight almost happened one night when they stopped by lake laberge there was heavy snow and it was very cold the lake was frozen and francois perrault and the dogs had to spend the night on the ice under a big rock buck had made a warm hole in the snow and was sorry to leave it to get his piece of fish but when he had eaten and returned to his hole he found spitz in it buck had tried not to fight spitz be fore but this was too much he attacked him angrily spitz was surprised he knew buck was big but he didn t know he was so wild francois was surprised too and guessed why buck was angry go on buck he shouted fight him the dirty thief spitz was also ready to fight and the two dogs circled one another looking for the chance to jump in but suddenly there was a shout from perrault and they saw eighty or a hundred dogs around the sledge the dogs came from an indian village and they were searching for the food that they could smell on the sledge perrault and francois tried to fight them off with their clubs but the dogs made crazy by the smell of the food showed their teeth and fought back buck had never seed dogs like these they were all skin and bone but hunger made them fight like wild things three of them attacked buck and in seconds his head and legs were bad ly bitten dave and sol leks stood side by side covered in blood fighting bravely joe and pike jumped on one dog and pike broke its neck with one bite buck caught another dog by the neck and tasted blood he threw himself on the next one and then felt teeth in his own neck it was spitz attacking him from the side perrault and francois came to help with clubs but then they had to run back to save the food it was safer for the nine sledge dogs to run away across the lake several of them were badly hurt and they spent an unhappy night hiding among the tress at first light they returned to the sledge and found perrault and francois tired and angry half their food was gone the indian dogs had even eaten one of perrault s shoes francois looked at his dogs unhappily ah my friends he said softly perhaps those bites will make you ill what do you think perrault perrault said nothing they still had six hundred kilometres to travel and he hoped very much that his sledge dogs had not caught rabies from the indian dogs the harness was torn and damaged and it was two hours be fore they were moving travelling slowly and painfully over the most difficult country that they had been in the thirty mile river was not frozen it ran too fast to freeze they spent six days trying to find a place to cross and every step was dangerous for dogs and men twelve times they found ice bridges across the river and perrault walked carefully onto them holding a long piece of wood and twelve times he fell through a bridge and was saved by the piece of wood which caught on the sides of the hole but the tempera ture was below zero and each time perrault fell into the water he had to light a fire to dry and warm himself once the sledge fell through the ice with dave and buck and they were covered in ice by the time perrault and francois pulled them out of the river again a fire was needed to save them another time spitz and the dogs in front fell through the ice buck and dave and francois at the sledge had to pull backwards that day they travelled only four hundred metres when they got to the hootalinqua and good ice buck and the other dogs were very very tired but they were late so perrault made them run faster in three days they went a hun dred and eighty kilometres and reached the five fingers the other dogs had hard feet from years of pulling sledges but buck s feet were still soft from his easy life down south all day he ran painfully and when they camped for the night he lay down like a dead dog he was hungry but he was too tired to walk to the fish so francois brought it to him one day francois made four little shoes for him and this made buck much more comfortable francois forgot the shoes one morning and buck refused to move he lay on his back with his feet in the air until francois put the shoes on later his feet grew harder and the shoes were not needed one morning at the pelly river a dog called delly went suddenly mad she howled long and loud like a wolf and then jumped at buck buck ran with dolly one step behind him she could not catch him but he could not escape from her they ran half a kilometre and then buck heard francois call to him he turned and ran towards the man sure that francois would save him francois stood holding his axe and as buck passed the axe crashed down on dolly s head buck fell down by the sledge too tired to move immedi ately spitz attacked him and bit his helpless enemy twice as hard as he could but francois saw this and gave spitz a ter rible beating for it he s a wild dog that spitz said perrault one day he ll kill buck buck is wilder replied francois i ve been watching him one day he ll get very angry and he ll fight spitz and he ll win francois was right buck wanted to be lead dog spitz knew this and hated him buck started to help the other dogs when spitz punished them for being lazy one morning pike refused to get up and spitz looked for him everywhere when he found him he jumped at him but suddenly buck at tacked spitz the other dogs saw this and it became more and more difficult for spitz to lead them but the days passed without a chance for a fight and soon they were pulling into dawson city on a cold grey afternoon they stayed in dawson for seven days when they left perrault was carrying some more very important papers and he wanted to travel back as fast as possible they travelled eighty kilometres the first day and the same the second but it was difficult work for francois buck and spitz hated each other and the other dogs were not afraid of spitz any more one night pike stole half a fish from spitz and ate it standing next to buck and every time buck went near spitz he growled and the hair on his back stood up angri ly the other dogs fought in their harnesses and francois often had to stop the sledge he knew that buck was the problem but buck was too clever for him and francois never saw him actually starting a fight one night in camp the dogs saw a snow rabbit and in a sec ond they were all chasing it with spitz in front nearby was another camp with fifty dogs who also joined the chase the rabbit was running fast on top of the snow but the snow was soft and it was more difficult for the dogs when spitz caught the rabbit throwing it in the air with his teeth buck was just behind spitz stopped and buck hit him very hard the two dogs fell in the snow spitz bit buck very quickly twice and then jumped away watching carefully the time had come and buck knew that either he or spitz must die they watched one another circling slowly themoon was shining brightly on the snow and in the cold still air not a leaf moved on the trees the other dogs finished eating the rabbit and then turned to watch spitz was a good fighter he was full of hate and anger but he was also intelligent every time buck tried to bite his throat he met spitz s own teeth then each time buck attacked spitz moved and bit him on the side as he passed after a few minutes buck was covered in blood he attacked again but this time turned at the last minute and went under spitz biting his left front leg the bone broke and spitz was standing on three legs buck tried to knock spitz down and then repeated his earlier attack and broke spitz s right front leg there was no hope for spitz now buck got ready for his final attack while the circle of sixty dogs watched and crowded nearer and nearer waiting for the end at last buck jumped in and out and spitz went down in the snow a second later the waiting pack was on top of him and spitz had disappeared buck stood and watched the wild animal had made its kill the new lead dog well what did i say buck s a real fighter all right said francois the next morning when he discovered that spitz had disappeared and that buck was covered in blood spitz fought like a wolf said perrault as he looked at the bites all over buck and buck fought like ten wolves answered francois and we ll travel faster now no more spitz no more trouble francois started to harness the dogs he needed a new lead dog and decided that sol leks was the best dog that he had but buck jumped at sol leks and took his place look at buck said francois laughing he s killed spitz and now he wants to be lead dog go away buck he pulled buck away and tried to harness sol leks again sol leks was unhappy too he was frightened of buck and when francois turned his back buck took sol leks place again now francois was angry i ll show you he cried and went to get a heavy club from the sledge buck remembered the man in the red coat and moved away this time when sol leks was harnessed as lead dog buck did not try to move in he kept a few metres away and circled around francois carefully but when francois called him to his old place in front of dave buck refused he had won his fight with spitz and he wanted to be lead dog for an hour the two men tried to harness him buck did not run away but he did not let them catch him finally francois sat down and perrault looked at his watch it was getting late the two men looked at one another and smiled francois walked up to sol leks took off his harness led him back and harnessed him in his old place then he called buck all the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front but buck did not move put down the club said perrault francois dropped the club and immediately buck came up to the front of the team francois harnessed him and in a minute the sledge was moving buck was an excellent leader he moved and thought quick ly and led the other dogs well a new leader made no differ ence to dave and sol leks they continued to pull hard but the other dogs had had an easy life when spitz was leading they were surprised when buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes pike the second dog was usually lazy but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life the first night in camp buck fought joe another difficult dog and after that there were no more problems with him the team started to pull together and to move faster and faster i ve never seen a dog like buck cried francois never he s worth a thousand dollars what do you think perrault perrault agreed they were moving quickly and covering more ground every day the snow was good and hard and no new snow fell the temperature dropped to below zero and didn t change this time there was more ice on the thirty mile river and they crossed in a day some days they ran a hundred kilome tres or even more they reached skagway in fourteen days the fastest time ever for three days the dogs rested in skagway then francois put his arms around buck s neck and said goodbye to him and that was the last of francois and perrault like other men they passed out of buck s life for ever two new men took buck and his team back north on the long journey to dawson travelling with several other dog teams it was heavy work the sledge was loaded with letters for the gold miners of dawson buck did not like it but he worked hard and made the other dogs work hard too each day was the same they started early before it was light and at night they stopped and camped and the dogs ate for the dogs this was the best part of the day first eating then resting by the fire buck liked to lie by the fire looking at the burning wood sometimes he thought about mr miller s house in california more of ten he remembered the man in the red coat and his club the death of curly the fight with spitz and the good things that he had eaten but sometimes he remembered other things these were things that he remembered through his parents and his parents parents and all the dogs which had lived before him sometimes as he lay there he seemed to see in a waking dream a different fire and he saw next to him not the indian cook but another man a man with shorter legs and longer arms this man had long hair and deep eyes and madestrange noises in his throat he was very frightened of the dark and looked around him all the time holding a heavy stone in his hand he wore the skin of an animal on his back and buck could see thick hair all over his body buck sat by the fire with this hairy man and in the circling darkness beyond the fire he could see many eyes the eyes of hungry animals waiting to attack and he growled softly in his dream until the indian cook shouted hey buck wake up then the strange world disappeared and buck s eyes saw the real fire again when they reached dawson the dogs were tired and needed a week s rest but in two days they were moving south again with another heavy load of letters both dogs and men were unhappy it snowed every day as well and on soft new snow it was harder work pulling the sledges the men took good care of their dogs in the evenings the dogs ate first the men second and they always checked the dogs feet before they slept but every day the dogs became weaker buck had pulled sledges for three thousand kilometres that winter and he was as tired as the others but dave was not only tired he was ill every evening he lay down the minute after the sledge stopped and did not stand up until morning the men looked at him but they could find no broken bones something was wrong inside one day he started to fall down while in his harness the sledge stopped and the driver took him out of his harness he wanted to give him a rest and let him run free behind the sledge but dave did not want to stop working he hated to see another dog doing his work so he ran along beside the sledge trying to push sol leks out of his place when the sledge made its next stop dave bit through sol leks harness and pushed him away then he stood there in his old place in front of the sledge waiting for his harness and the order to start pulling the driver decided it was kinder to let him work dave pulled all day but the next morning he was too weak to move the driver harnessed up without dave and drove a few hun dred metres then he stopped took his gun and walked back the dogs heard a shot and then the man came quickly back the sledge started to move again but buck knew and every dog knew what had happened more hard work thirty days after leaving dawson city the team arrived back in skagway they were very very tired buck now weighed only fifty kilograms and the other dogs were also very thin they were not ill they just needed a long long rest but at skagway there were mountains of letters waiting to go north so the men had to buy new strong dogs the old ones now useless for work were sold two american men called hal and charles bought buck and his team together with the harness charles was forty years old with light hair and watery blue eyes hal was a young man of twenty with a big shiny gun and a big knife in his belt these things more than anything showed how young he was both men were clearly new to the north and its hard and dangerous life they took the dogs back to their untidy camp where a woman was waiting this was mercedes charles s wife and hal s sister buck watched the men take down the tent and load all their luggage on the sledge they didn t know how to do it sensibly and every time they put something on the sledge mercedes moved it often they had to take things off the sledge and start again three men came up and watched laughing you ve got a heavy load on that sledge said one of them why don t you leave the tent here in skagway how could we live without a tent asked mercedes throwing up her hands in the air it s spring now you won t have any more cold weather i must have a tent she answered and helped charles and hal with the last few boxes do you think that load will stay on asked another man why shouldn t it asked charles well it s a bit heavy on top do you think your dogs will be able to pull that of course they will said hal the sledge was now ready to go come on dogs pull he shouted the dogs pulled as hard as they could but the sledge did not move the lazy animals shouted hal picking up his whip but mercedes stopped him oh hal you mustn t she cried pulling the whip away from him the poor dogs you must promise to be nice to them or i m staying here you know nothing about dogs answered hal leave me alone dogs are lazy and you have to whip them everybody knows that ask those men if you don t believe me mercedes turned and looked at the watching men they re tired if you really want to know said one of them they ve been working very hard and they need a rest rest laughed hal these stupid dogs are just lazy now mercedes decided that her brother was right don t listen to that man she said you re driving our dogs and you do what you think is best now hal used his whip on the dogs they pulled and pulled but the sledge stayed where it was hal was still using his whip when mercedes stopped him again and put her arms around buck you poor poor dears she said why don t you pull hard then nobody will whip you one of the men watching now spoke again i don t care what happens to you he said but i m sorry for the dogs the sledge is frozen to the snow and you ll have to break it out push it from one side to the other to break the ice hal tried again but this time he broke the ice under the sledge the heavy sledge started to move slowly buck and his team pulling hard under the whip after a hundred metres they had to turn into another street it was a difficult turn with a top heavy load and hal was not a good driver as they turned the sledge went over onto its side throwing boxes and packets into the street the dogs didn t stop the sledge was not so heavy now and they pulled it easily on its side the whip had made them angry and they started to run hal cried stop but the dogs continued through skagway and the rest of the luggage fell off as they ran people helped to catch the dogs and to pick up all the things from the street they also told the men that if they wanted to reach dawson they needed twice as many dogs and half as much luggage hal and charles went back to the camp and started to look at the luggage and throw things away tent blankets and plates were taken out mercedes cried when most of her clothes went when they had finished mercedes was still crying there was a lot of luggage on the road and there was still a lot to go on the sledge then charles and hal went out and bought six more dogs so they now had fourteen but the new dogs were not real sledge dogs and they knew nothing about the work charles and hal put them into harness but buck could not teach them how to pull a sledge so now there were six dogs who couldn t pull at all and eight who were tired after pulling for four thousand kilometres but charles and hal were happy they had more dogs than any sledge that they had seen at skagway they didn t know that no sledge could carry enough food for fourteen dogs the next morning buck led the team up the street they moved slowly because they were tired before they started buck had pulled to dawson and back twice and he didn t want to do it again he had watched hal and charles and mercedes and he saw that they didn t know how to do any thing and as the days passed he saw that they could not learn it took them half the evening to get everything ready for the night and it took them half the morning to get ready to leave and when they did start they often had to stop because something had fallen off the sledge on some days they travelled twenty kilometres and on some days only ten they didn t have enough dog food when they started and they used what they had much too quickly hal gave the dogs extra food because he wanted them to pull harder mercedes gave them extra food because she was sorry for them but it was not food that they wanted but rest soon hal saw that they had travelled only a quarter of the way to dawson but had eaten half their food he had to give the dogs less food it was easy to give them less food but it was impossible to make them travel faster dub had pulled hard and well all the way from skagway but he had hurt his leg it got worse and worse until finally hal had to shoot him the six new dogs now weak and ill from hunger and hard work died next hal charles and mercedes had started the journey happily but now they were tired cross and miserable charles and hal argued about everything because each thought that he was working harder than the other and mer cedes was unhappy because she thought that she shouldn t have to work she was tired so she rode on the sledge mak ing the work even harder for the dogs she rode for days until the dogs could not move the sledge the men asked her to walk but she would not leave the sledge one day they lifted her off she sat in the snow and did not move they went off with the sledge and travelled five kilometres then they turned went back and lifted her on again buck and the other dogs were now just skin and bone they pulled when they could and when they couldn t they lay down in the snow when they were whipped they stood up and tried to pull again one day billee fell and could not stand up hal killed him and threw him into the snow buck and the other dogs knew that soon they were going to die too on the next day koona died and there were only five dogs left joe pike sol leks the one eyed teek and buck it was beautiful spring weather the snow and ice were melting the plants were growing and the forest animals were waking from their winter sleep it was a lovely morning when the two men and the five dogs pulling mercedes on the sledge came into john thornton s camp at white river they stopped and the dogs dropped down immediately to rest john thornton was mending an axe and he went on working as he talked to hal is it safe to cross the river here asked hal no the ice is too thin it s much too dangerous answered thornton people have told us that before laughed hal but we got here with no problems only somebody very stupid would cross the white river here said thornton that s what you think said hal but we ve got to get to dawson he pickd up his whip come on buck get up now let s go thornton went on working he had warned them but he knew he couldn t stop these stupid men from going on but buck didn t get up sol leks stood up slowly then teek and joe and finally pike but buck stayed where he was the whip came down on him again and again thornton started to speak then stopped and began to walk up and down hal now put down his whip and started to hit buck with a club but buck had decided not to get up he had felt thin ice under his feet all day and he saw thin ice in front of him the club hit him again and again but buck felt almost nothing then suddenly with a wild cry john thornton jumped on hal throwing him backwards mercedes screamed if you hit that dog again i kill you thornton shouted he s my dog hal replied there was blood on his face get out of my way or i hit you too i m going to dawson thornton stood between hal and buck and did not move hal took out his long knife but thornton knocked it out of his hand mercedes screamed again then thornton picked up hal s knife and cut buck out of the harness hal didn t want to fight and buck was not worth fighting for he was nearly dead hal started the sledge and went down towards the river buck lifted his head and watched the sledge move away pike was leading and joe teek and sol leks were behind him hal was walking in front of the sledge and mercedes was riding on it charles was walking behind as buck watched thornton felt his body with gentle hands searching for broken bones buck was very thin very tired and very weak but thornton didn t think he was going to die then both dog and man watched the sledge as it went slowly out on to the ice in the middle of the river suddenly the back of the sledge went down and the front went up into the air mercedes screamed and charles turned and took one step back then a big piece of ice broke off and dogs sledge and people disappeared there was only a big hole in the ice john thornton and buck looked at one another you poor thing said john thornton and buck licked his hand for the love of a man john thornton had been ill in december and his two friends had had to leave him at white river and go on to dawson they left him in the camp with plenty of food and with his two dogs skeet and blackie now the spring had come and he was almost well he lay in the sun by the river with buck watching the water and listening to the birds slowly getting stronger and stronger a rest is very welcome after running five thousand kilome tres and buck slowly got fatter and stronger it was a peace ful lazy time for both man and dogs while they waited for thornton s friends to return from dawson skeet made friends with buck immediately and while buck was still very ill every morning she washed his cuts carefully with her tongue blackie too was friendly and as buck grew stronger the three dogs often played games together sometimes thornton joined the games too the days passed very happily and for the first time buck learned to love he had never loved a man before he and mr miller in the santa clara valley had been very good friends but buck had not loved him john thornton had saved his life but he was also a man who was naturally kind to animals he took very good care of his dogs not because it was sensible to do that but because he felt they were his children he was always talking to buck holding his head and shaking it lovingly in answer buck liked to take thornton s hand gently in his mouth buck was happy to lie on the ground all day and watch thornton and when thornton spoke to him or touched him buck went wild with happiness at first he was afraid that thornton was going to disappear like perrault and francois and at night he sometimes woke up and went to the tent to make sure that he was still there but something was changing in buck he had lived in the north a long time now and he was almost a wild dog he was happy to sit by thornton s fire but he sat as a wild animal and his dreams were filled with other animals dogs half wolves and wild wolves they seemed to call him into the forest and sometimes buck wanted to leave the fire and answer the call but every time he went into the trees his love for thornton brought him back it was only thornton who stopped him going into the forest other men did not interest him visitors to the camp tried to make friends with him but buck stayed cold when thornton s two friends hans and pete arrived from dawson buck refused to notice them at first then he saw that they were friends of thornton s and after that he accept ed them but they were not his friends they were like thornton kind men and they understood that buck loved thornton and him alone thornton too understood buck one day buck and the three men were sitting on some high rocks a hundred metres above the river thornton wondered if buck would obey any order even a crazy one jump buck he shouted pointing down to the river a second later the three men were holding buck back as he tried to jump that was very strange said pete when they had sat down again not strange wonderful said thornton terrible too sometimes it frightens me yes i feel sorry for any man who hits you when buck s near said pete so do i said hans it happened in the autumn in circle city a man called bur ton was starting a fight with another man in a bar thornton stepped between them to try to stop them buck was as usual lying in the corner watching burton hit thornton and he nearly fell just catching a table buck flew through the air at burton s throat burton saved his life by putting up his arm and was thrown on to the ground with buck on top of him buck took his teeth out of the man s arm and this time bit into his throat then a crowd of people pulled buck off and a doctor was called everyone agreed that buck had only attacked because he saw thornton in danger and from that day buck s name became famous all over the north later that year buck saved thornton in a different way the three men were taking a boat down a fast and rocky river thornton was in the boat while hans and pete moved along the river bank holding the boat with a rope buck followed them keeping a worried eye on thornton they came to a more dangerous part of the river and the boat started to go too quickly hans pulled on the rope to stop it and pulled too hard the boat turned over and thornton was thrown into the water and carried down river towards rocks where no swimmer could live buck jumped in immediately and swam three hundred me tres until he reached thornton then he turned and with thornton holding his tail buck swam towards the river bank but they moved slowly and all the time the river was carrying them towards the place where the water crashed twenty metres down onto rocks thornton knew that they would not get to the bank quickly enough so he let go of buck held on to a rock in the middle of the water and shouted go buck go buck swam as hard as he could to the bank and pete and hans pulled him out it was hard for thornton to hold on to his rock in that wild water and his friends knew they had only a few minutes to save him they tied their rope round buck who at once jumped into the river and tried to swim to thornton the first time the water took him past the rock and pete and hans had to pull him back the second time he swam higher up the river and the water brought him down to thornton thornton held on to buck and hans and pete pulled the rope as hard as they could man and dog disappeared under the water banging into rocks turning over and over sometimes with buck on top sometimes thornton when hans and pete finally pulled them out both seemed more dead than alive but after a while their eyes opened and life returned that winter at dawson buck did something that made him even more famous in the north it was also very helpful to the three men they wanted to make a journey to look for gold in the east and they needed money they were in a bar one day when some of the men started to talk about dogs one man said that he had a dog who was strong enough to pull a sledge with two hundred kilos on it another said his dog could pull two hundred and fifty a third man called matthewson said his dog could pull three hundred kilos that s nothing said thornton buck can pull three hundred and fifty can he break the sledge out when it s frozen to the ice and then start it moving and pull it a hundred metres asked matthewson he can break it out and start it and pull it a hundred metres said thornton well said matthewson speaking slowly and loudly i ve got a thousand dollars here and i say he can t as he spoke he took a bag of gold and put it down on the table suddenly thornton was worried he knew buck was strong but was he strong enough now ten men were watching him and waiting he didn t have a thousand dollars and neither did hans or pete i ve got a sledge outside with three hundrd and fifty kilos on it said matthewson so it s easy if you want to try thornton didn t know what to say he looked at the other men in the bar one of them was an old friend jim o brien can yon lend me a thousand dollars jim he asked softly sure said o brien putting another bag of gold next to matthewson s but i don t think the dog can do it john everybody went out into the street there were two or three hundred men around matthewson s sledge the sledge had been outside the bar for two hours and it was frozen to the ice in a temperature of below zero most of the men thought that buck was not strong enough and matthewson smiled happily shall we make it two thousand dollars he asked thornton hans and pete talked for a minute they had only four hundred dollars but they added this to o brien s thousand matthewson very sure of winning also put down another four hundred dollars matthewson s ten dogs were taken away and buck who could feel the excitement in the air was harnessed to the sledge buck was without question a very fine animal bright eyed intelligent his thick coat shining with health and he looked as strong as a horse one man went up to thornton i ll buy him now he said i give you eight hundred dollars for him thornton shook his head and sat down on the snow next to buck he held buck s head in his hands and spoke softly into his ear if you love me buck if you love me buck took thornton s hand between his teeth then let go and thornton stood up and stepped back ready buck he said buck pulled on the harness a little getting ready right cried thornton buck pulled to the right hard stopped suddenly and the ice under the sledge began to break now left called thornton and buck pulled to the left breaking more of the ice now pull buck threw himself against his harness and pulled he held his body low to the ground his head down and forward and his feet dug into the hard snow harder and harder he pulled suddenly the sledge moved a centimetre two three and little by little it started to go forward across the snow with each second it went a little faster and thornton ran be hind calling to buck as he pulled the sledge towards the end of the hundred metres the watching men were shouting and throwing their hats in the air buck had won then thornton was on the snow next to buck again talking to him and buck had thornton s hand in his teeth the call of the wild in five minutes buck had made fourteen hundred dollars for thornton and his friends the money made it possi ble for them to travel east where they wanted to look for a lost gold mine men said that this mine had more gold than any other mine in the north many had looked for it and some had died looking for it the only men who knew where it was were now dead thornton pete and hans with buck and six other dogs started off to the east in the spring they travelled up the stewart river and crossed the mackenzie mountains they did not move quickly the weather was good and the men shot animals for food when they needed it sometimes they travelled for a week and sometimes they stopped for a week and searched for gold in the ground sometimes they were hungry and sometimes they had lots of food they spent all the summer in the mountains carrying everything they needed on their backs sometimes making boats to go down rivers or across lakes in the autumn they came to a strange flat country with many lakes they travelled on through the winter and met nobody but once they found an old wooden house with an old gun in it when the spring came they found not the lost mine but a lake in a wide valley through the shallow water the gold showed like yellow butter and here their search ended there was gold worth thousands of dollars in the lake and they worked every day filling bag after bag with gold the dogs had nothing to do except watch the men and eat the food which the men shot for them buck spent many evenings sitting by the fire as he sat he saw again his dream world where the strange hairy man sat next to him he also heard something calling him into the forest sometimes in the middle of the day he lifted his head and listened and then ran off into the forest one night he woke up and heard the call again a long howl he ran into the forest following the sound and came to an open place in the trees and there his nose pointing to the sky sat a wolf the wolf stopped howling and buck walked slowly towards him the wolf ran and buck followed after a time the wolf stopped and waited watching buck ready to attack but buck did not want to fight and soon the wolf realized this and the two animals became friendly then the wolf started to run again and he clearly wanted buck to follow him they ran for hours through the forest and buck remembered again his dream world where he and others like him had run through a much older forest then they stopped to drink and buck remembered john thornton he turned and started to run back the wolf followed him then stopped and howled but buck ran on and did not turn thornton was eating dinner when buck returned buck jumped all over him and for two days never left his side he followed him every where watching him while he ate and while he slept but after two days the call of the wild came again and he remembered the forest and the wolf who had run beside him he started to sleep out in the forest at night sometimes staying out for three or four days once he was away for a week fishing and killing animals for food he ate well and he grew stronger and quicker and more alive his golden brown coat shone with health as he ran through the forest learning its every secret every smell and every sound he s the finest dog that i ve ever seen said thornton to his friends one day as they watched buck walking out of camp there never be another dog like him said pete they saw him walking out of camp but they didn t see the change that happened when he was inside the forest at once he became a thing of the wild stepping softly and silently a passing shadow among the trees in the autumn buck started to see moose in the forest one day he met a group of about twenty the largest was two me tres tall and his antlers were more than two metres across when he saw buck he got very angry for hours buck fol lowed the moose he wanted the big one but he wanted him alone by the evening buck had driven the big old moose away from the others and then he began his attack the animal weighed six hundred and fifty kilos he was big enough and strong enough to kill buck in seconds patiently buck fol lowed him for four days attacking and then jumping away he gave him no peace no time to eat or drink or rest and slowly the moose became weaker at the end of the fourth day buck pulled the moose down and killed him he stayed by the dead animal for a day and a half eating and then turned towards camp and john thornton five kilometres from the camp he smelt something strange something was wrong he started to run after a few hundred metres he found the dead body of blackie with an arrow through his side then he found another sledge dog dying with an arrow in his neck buck was near the camp now and he could hear voices singing then he saw the body of hans lying on his face with ten or fifteen arrows in his back buck was suddenly filled with a wild burning anger the yeehats were dancing around the camp when they heard a deep and terrible growling buck came out of the trees faster than the north wind and threw himself on the yeehats like a mad dog he jumped at the first man and tore out his throat killing him at once he jumped onto a second then a third man going each time for the throat the yeehats could neither escape nor use their arrows buck moved like a storm among them tearing biting destroying in a madness that he had never known before nothing could stop him and soon the yeehats were running wild with fear back to the forest buck followed for some time then returned to the camp he found pete killed in his bed he followed thornton s smell to a deep pool and found skeet lying dead by the edge thornton s body was somewhere under the water all day buck stayed by the pool or walked restlessly round the camp but when the evening came he heard new sounds from the forest the wolves had come south for the winter and were moving into buck s valley they came into the camp in the moonlight and buck stood silently waiting for them suddenly the bravest wolf jumped at buck in a second buck had bitten and then stood still again the wolf was dead behind him three more wolves jumped at him and were killed then the pack attacked in a crowd all at once but not one of them could bring buck down he was too quick too strong too clever for them all after half an hour the pack stopped attacking and moved away then one wolf moved forward slowly in a friendly way it was the wolf that buck had met before in the forest they touched noses then another wolf came forward to make friends and another soon the pack was all around buck and the call of the wild was loud in buck s ears and when the wolves moved on back into the forest buck ran with them side by side that is perhaps the end of buck s story but after a few years the yeehats noticed that some of the wolves had golden brown in their grey coats they also talked of a ghost dog that ran at the head of the pack and sometimes men were found dead killed by the teeth of a terrible animal and each autumn when the yeehats follow the moose there is one valley that they will not go into in the summers there is one visitor to that valley a large golden brown wolf larger than any other wolf he walks alone round the lake where the yellow gold shines in the water and howls but he is not always alone in the long winter nights he runs at the head of the wolf pack through the moonlight calling into the night with them singing a song from a younger world txtba www txtba com looking glass house one thing was certain it was the black kitten that began it all the white kitten had been unable to do anything for the last quarter of an hour because the old cat was washing its face very slowly and very carefully but the black kitten was free to do what it wanted and so while alice was sitting in a corner of the great armchair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten was playing a grand game with a ball of wool soon the wool was lying in a terrible tangle all over the carpet with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle oh you bad little thing cried alice when she saw the wool she picked up the kitten and climbed back into the armchair you really mustn t play with the wool you know it will take me so long to roll the ball up again why don t you play chess instead kitty when i was playing a while ago you were watching me so carefully in fact you look just like the red queen yourself and alice picked up the red queen from the chessmen on the table and held it up to show the kitten but the kitten tried to escape and to punish it alice lifted it up to the looking glass above the fireplace if you re not good kitty she said i ll put you through into looking glass house how would you like that i do wonder alice went on if everything in that room is the same as in our room the things that i can see look the same except the books because the words go the wrong way but perhaps the rest of the house is really different and full of interesting things oh i wish we could get through kitty let s pretend we can let s pretend the glass has gone soft and why i do believe it has it s turning into a kind of cloud alice did not know how it happened but while she was speaking she found herself climbing up to the looking glass and the glass was beginning to disappear just like a bright silvery cloud in another moment alice was through the glass and had jumped down into the looking glass room at once she began looking around and noticed that several things were very different from the old room the pictures on the wall all seemed to be alive and the clock above the fireplace had the face of a little old man who smiled at her this room isn t as tidy as the other one alice thought to herself as she noticed several chessmen on the floor by the fireplace but the next moment with a little oh of surprise she was down on the floor herself watching them the chessmen were walking around arm in arm here are the red king and the red queen alice said in a whisper in order not to frighten them and there are two castles walking together and two of the pawns and a white bishop reading a newspaper i don t think they can hear me or see me she went on i wonder then something on the table behind her made a noise alice turned to look and saw that one of the white pawns had fallen over and begun to cry she watched it with interest it is the voice of my child cried the white queen by the fireplace my dear lily my sweet child and she began to climb wildly up the table leg poor little lily was now screaming loudly alice wanted to be helpful so she picked up the queen and put her on the table next to her noisy little daughter the queen sat very still with her mouth open for almost a minute then she called down to the white king who was still on the floor by the fireplace be careful of the storm what storm said the king looking round worriedly there s a terrible wind it blew me up here in a second you come up the usual way and be careful alice watched as the white king slowly began to climb the table leg then she said it will take you hours to get up why don t i help you gently she picked him up and moved him slowly upwards the king was very surprised indeed his eyes and his mouth got larger and larger and rounder and rounder alice nearly dropped him because she was laughing so much when she put him down on the table he immediately fell flat on his back and lay still but after a while he sat up andspoke to the queen in a frightened whisper i tell you my dear i turned cold to the very ends of my hair i shall never never forget that moment you will the queen said if you don t write it down alice watched with interest as the king took out a very large notebook and began writing then she saw a book lying on the table near her and began to turn the pages it s all in some language that i don t know she said to herself it was like this puzzled she looked at it for some time then suddenly understood of course it s a looking glass book if i hold it up to the glass the words will go the right way again this was the poem that alice read jabberwocky twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogoves and the mome raths outgrabe it seems very pretty alice said but a little hard to un derstand actually she didn t understand a word of it but didn t like to say so it seems to fill my head with ideasbut i don t know what they are then she suddenly jumped up as another idea came to her if i don t hurry i shall have to go back through the looking glass before i ve seen the rest of the house and the garden i ll look at the garden first i think in a moment she was out of the room and running down the stairs but it wasn t really running because she was moving gently through the air and her feet weren t touching the stairs at all at the bottom she managed to catch hold of the doorpost and after that she was pleased to find herself walking again in a natural way the garden of live flowers there was a small hill not far away and alice decided to walk to it i shall be able to see the garden better from the top of the hill she said she tried very hard to reach the hill but it seemed impossible to get to it she went first this way then that way but every time she turned a corner she found herself back at the house i m not going in again yet she told the house crossly i ll have to go back through the looking glass into the old room and that s the end of all my adventures then she tried once more and this time passed a large flowerbed with a tree growing in the middle oh tiger lily alice said to one of the flowers i wish you could talk we can talk said the tiger lily if there is anybody interesting enough to talk to for a minute alice was too sur prised to speak then she said almost in a whisper and can all the flowers talk as well as you can said the tiger lily and a lot louder it isn t polite for us to begin you know said the rose and i was really wondering when you would speak but why can you all talk alice said puzzled i ve been in many gardens before and none of the flowers could talk put your hand down and feel the ground said the tiger lily then you ll know why alice did so it s very hard she said but how does that explain it in most gardens the tiger lily said they make the flowerbeds too soft so the flowers are always asleep this sounded a very good reason to alice i never thought of that before she said do you ever think at all asked the rose unkindly i never saw anybody with a more stupid face said a daisy suddenly it was the first time it had spoken and alice jumped in surprise oh be quiet cried the tiger lily what do you daisies know about the world are there any other people in the garden alice asked there s one other flower that can move around like you said the rose she s the same strange shape as you but she s redder with more leaves than you have she s coming now cried another daisy i can hear her feet bang bang bang on the ground alice looked round quickly and saw that it was the red queen she s grown a lot alice thought when she had seen her by the fireplace the queen had been only eight cen timetres high now she was taller than alice herself i think i ll go and meet her alice said you can t possibly do that said the rose you must walk the other way if you want to meet her this sounded nonsense to alice so she began to walk to wards the red queen to her surprise she found herself a minute later walking in through the front door of the house she turned round crossly and saw the queen again on the other side of the garden this time she tried walking the other way away from the queen it succeeded beautifully a minute later she was standing opposite the red queen and very near the hill that she had wanted to get to where do you come from said the red queen where are you going and why are you here at all look up speak nicely keep your hands still and curtsy while you re think ing what to say it saves time alice tried to obey all these orders feeling just a little frightened of the queen i only wanted to look at the garden your majesty from the top of that hill she began hill cried the queen some people would call that a valley but a hill can t be a valley said alice that would be nonsense the red queen shook her head you can call it nonsense if you like some people would say it was sensible alice curtsied again and decided it would be safer not to argue any more together they walked on in silence up the hill at the top alice could see right across the country and a very strange country it was there were lots of little brooks running across from side to side and there were long lines of hedges going the other way it was a country of squares it s just like a large chess board alice said at last oh and i can see some chessmen down there her heart began to beat fast with excitement it s a great game of chess as big as the world itself if this is the world at all oh what fun i wish i could be in it even as a pawn although i would love to be a queen of course she looked a little worriedly at the real queen as she said this but the red queen smiled kindly and said you can be the white queen s pawn if you like lily is too young to play you re in the second square now and when you get to the eighth square you ll be a queen just at that moment they began to run alice never did un derstand how it happened but she had no time to think about it because they were running so fast faster faster cried the queen pulling alice s hand they ran like the wind but the strange thing was that they never seemed to pass anything the trees and other things round them never changed their places at all alice was very puzzled by this but still the queen cried faster faster now they were almost flying over the ground alice had never run so fast in her life when at last they stopped she had to sit down because her legs were shaking then she looked around in surprise but we ve been under this same tree all the time we re still in the same place of course we are said the queen why shouldn t we be well in our country said alice if you run very fast for a long time you usually arrive at a different place what a slow kind of country said the queen here you see you have to run very fast just to keep in the same place if you want to go somewhere different you must run twice as fast now she went on i shall tell you what to do while i m speaking i shall take five steps and at the fifth step i shall go she took two steps away from the tree and turned round a pawn goes two squares in its first move so you ll go very quickly through the third square by railway probably then you ll be in the fourth square which belongs to twee dledum and tweedledee the fifth square is mostly water and the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty but why haven t you said anything i didn t know i had to say anything said alice it s polite said the queen to say thank you for all this information but never mind let s pretend you said it the seventh square is all forest one of the knights will show you the way and in the eighth square we shall be queens together and it s all parties and fun alice got up and curtsied and sat down again the queen took another two steps and turned round again speak in french when you can t think of the english word and always remember who you are she took another step and was gone alice did not know if she had disappeared into the air or run into the wood but she had certainly gone and alice began to remember that she was a pawn and that it would soon be time to move looking glass animals alice stood at the top of the hill and looked down which way should i go she wondered on one side she could see a long way away some kind of large animals walking around she wasn t sure that she liked the look of them so she decided to go the other way she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks tickets please said the ticket inspector putting his head in at the window in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket the tickets were almost as big as the people and seemed to fill the train show your ticket child the inspector went on looking angrily at alice and then several voices said all together don t keep him waiting child his time costs a thousand pounds a minute i m afraid i haven t got a ticket alice said in a frightened voice there wasn t a ticket office where i came from why didn t you buy one from the engine driver said the inspector and again the voices said the engine driver s time costs a thousand pounds a minute the inspector looked at alice first through his glasses then over the top of them then he said you re travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went away she ought to know which way she s going said the gen tleman sitting opposite alice he was dressed in white paper but perhaps she doesn t know her own name a goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white said loudly she ought to know her way to the ticket office but perhaps she can t read or write there was a beetle next to the goat and he had something to say about alice as well then other voices spoke but alice could not see who they were one voice sounded like a horse she thought and then a very small voice right next to her ear said you could make a poem out of that something about a horse of course the gentleman in white paper spoke again don t worry my dear he whispered just buy a return ticket every time the train stops no i won t alice said crossly i don t belong to this railway journey at all i was in a wood just now and i wish i could get back there then she heard the little voice again she looked round but could see nothing i know you are a friend the voice said in her ear a dear friend and you won t hurt me although i am an insect what kind of insect alice asked a little worried but just then there came a long scream from the engine and eve rybody jumped up the horse put his head out of the window then pulled it back in and said calmly it s only a brook that we have to jump across alice did not like the idea of trains jumping brooks but we ll get into the fourth square i suppose she said to her self in another moment she felt the train go straight up into the air frightened she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the goat s beard but the beard seemed to disappear as she touched it and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree there was an insect sitting near her on a low branch of the tree it was a very large insect indeed almost as big as a chick en alice thought so you don t like all insects the insect said quietly con tinuing their conversation i like them when they can talk alice said none of them ever talk where i come from but everything here is so different i probably don t even know the names of the insects here can you remember your own name asked the insect of course said alice nobody forgets their own name don t they said the insect there s a wood down there for example where things have no names alice looked round and saw a dark wood on the other side of an open field when she looked back the insect had flown away she got up and began to walk across the field this must be the way to the eighth square she thought but i hope i don t lose my name in this wood she soon reached the wood and was pleased to get out of the hot sun and into the shadows under the trees how nice and cool it is in here under the under the under the what she said surprised that she could not think of the word she put her hand on a tree what does it call itself i do believe it s got no name she stood for a moment thinking and now who am i i will remember if i can she tried and tried but she just could not remember her name it began with an l she thought but she wasn t really sure so she hurried on through the wood hoping to get to the other side quickly and after a while she came out into another open field she stopped and thought hard why it s alice of course she said my name s alice i won t forget itagain and now which way should i go it was not a difficult question to answer there was only one road and a large signpost which said to tweedledum s house to the house of tweedledee i ll just call in and say hello alice said and ask them the way to the eighth square i would like to get there before it gets dark so she walked on talking to herself as she went after a long time the road came into another wood and suddenly turned a corner and there in front of her alice saw two fat little men standing under a tree l tweedledum and tweedledee alice knew immediately which one was which because each had his name on his shirt they were standing very still with their arms round each other and alice forgot that they were alive they look just like schoolboys she said aloud then one of them spoke and alice jumped in sur prise you ve begun wrong cried the one called tweedledum the first thing in a visit is to say how do you do and shake hands and here the brothers held out the two hands that were free to shake hands with her alice did not know which hand to shake first so she took hold of both hands at once the next moment they were all three dancing round in a circle this seemed very natural at the time and alice was not even surprised to hear music play ing the two brothers were fat and soon got tired four times round is enough for one dance tweedledee said and they stopped as suddenly as they had begun then they stood look ing at alice in silence alice did not know what to say how do you begin a con versation with people that you have just been dancing with she wondered i hope you re not too tired she said at last not at all and thank you very much for asking said tweedledum very kind of you added tweedledee do you like po ems ye es well some poems alice said carefully would you tell me which road to take out of the wood what shall i repeat to her tweedledee said to tweedle dum not noticing alice s question the walrus and the carpenter is the longest tweedle dum replied putting a friendly arm round his brother if it s very long alice said politely would you tell me first which road tweedledee smiled gently and began his poem it was a very long poem indeed all about a walrus and a carpenter who went for a walk along a beach and invited lots of young oysters to go with them the oysters accepted happily perhaps that wasn t very sensible of them alice said tweedledee only smiled and continued the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so and then they rested on a rock conveniently low and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings alice waited with interest to hear about this conversation but it never happened because the walrus and the carpenter went on to eat all the oysters instead at the end alice said i like the walrus best because he said he felt sorry for the poor oysters he ate more of them than the carpenter said tweedledee he ate faster you see oh said alice well then i like the carpenter best but he ate as many as he could get said tweedledum well they were both very unkind alice began then stopped when she heard a noise in the wood it sounded like a wild animal what s that she asked afraid it s only the red king snoring said tweedledee come and look at him the brothers each took one of alice s hands and they went through the wood to where the king was sleeping doesn t he look lovely said tweedledum alice really couldn t agree the king was lying in a very untidy way and was snoring loudly he s dreaming now said tweedledee and what do you think he s dreaming about nobody can guess that said alice why about you tweedledee said and if he stops dreaming about you where do you think you will be where i am now of course said alice oh no said tweedledum you ll be nowhere you re only a kind of thing in his dream if he wakes up you ll go out bang just like a light what nonsense alice said crossly and if i m only a kind of thing in his dream what are you i d like to know the same the brothers cried together shhh don t make so much noise alice said you ll wake him up how can you wake him said tweedledum when you re only one of the things in his dream you know very well that you re not real i am real said alice and began to cry i don t know why you re crying tweedledee said un kindly you won t become real that way i know they re talking nonsense alice thought to herself and there really isn t anything to cry about she gave herself a little shake then said i think i must find my way out of the wood now because it s getting very dark do you think it s going to rain possibly tweedledum said opening a large umbrella it was now getting very dark indeed and alice thought there must be a storm coming what a thick black cloud that is she said and how fast it comes why i do believe it got wings it s the crow tweedledee shouted fearfully the two brothers turned to run and had disappeared in a moment alice ran too and hid under some low trees it can t get me under here she thought but i wish its wings didn t make so much wind it s blowing everything around terribly and look here s somebody s shawl flying through the air the white queen she caught the shawl as she spoke and looked around for the owner a moment later the white queen came running wildly through the wood alice went to meet her with the shawl i m pleased i was able to catch it for you alice said as she helped the queen to put on her shawl again am i speak ing to the white queen she added politely yes said the queen as she pulled helplessly at her shawl oh dear i don t know what s the matter with my shawl today i think it s angry with me i ve pinned it here and i ve pinned it there but it s just not happy but it can t go straight you know if you pin it all on one side alice said as she gently put it right for her and i m afraid your hair is terribly untidy the hairbrush is lost in it somewhere the queen said un happily alice carefully took out the brush and pinned up the queen s hair more tidily there you look better now she said but really you should have a lady s maid i d be happy to take you the queen said twopence a week and jam every other day i don t want you to employ me alice said laughing and i don t like jam it s very good jam said the queen well i don t want any today thank you but you can t have jam today the queen said it s jam tomorrow and jam yesterday but never jam today it must be jam today sometimes alice argued no it isn t said the queen it s jam every other day today isn t any other day you know i don t understand that said alice very puzzled that s because we live backwards here explained the queen kindly it s always a little difficult at first live backwards alice repeated in great surprise i never heard of anybody doing that but there s one very useful thing about it the queen went on you can remember things both ways i only remember things one way alice said i can t re member things before they happen that s not very useful said the queen i can remember things that happened the week after next for example the king s messenger is in prison now but he hasn t done any thing wrong yet his crime will come much later but what happens if there is no crime asked alice and he doesn t do anything wrong at all that seems a strange way of at that moment the queen began to scream very loudly and to shake her hand around in the air oh oh she shout ed my finger s bleeding oh oh oh alice put her hands over her ears what is the matter she said in between the queen s screams have you cut your finger i haven t cut it yet the queen said but i soon shall oh oh oh when do you think you will do it alice asked trying not to laugh when i fasten my shawl again the queen said unhappily one of the pins will come out and oh oh as she said the words one of her shawl pins came undone and she quickly took hold of it trying to fasten it again take care cried alice you re holding it wrong she tried to help the queen but it was too late the pin had al ready gone deep into the queen s finger that explains the bleeding you see the queen said to alice with a smile now you understand the way things hap pen here but why don t you scream now alice asked holding her hands ready to put over her ears again i ve done all the screaming already said the queen why do it all again it s very difficult to believe alice said that life can happen backwards try to believe something a bit easier said the queen helpfully for example i m a hundred and one years old i can t believe that said alice can t you the queen said shaking her head sadly try again put your hands together and shut your eyes alice laughed there s no use trying she said nobody can believe impossible things perhaps you don t work hard enough at it said the queen when i was a child i worked at it for an hour a day why sometimes i ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast there goes my shawl again the pins had come undone again as she spoke and a sudden wind blew her shawl across a little brook the queen went flying after it and managed to catch it i ve got it she called happily now you will see me pin it on again all by myself then i hope your finger is better now alice said very po litely as she crossed the brook after the queen oh much better cried the queen her voice getting higher and higher as she went on much be etter be e e ter be e eh the last word sounded very like the sound that a sheep makes and alice looked at the queen in surprise and indeed the queen was now covered in a thick woolly coat and alice closed her eyes then opened them again she couldn t understand what had happened at all the wood had disappeared and she was in a little dark shop and it re ally was a sheep in front of her wearing large glasses and sit ting calmly on a chair knitting what do you want to buy the sheep said at last lookingup for a moment from her knitting i m not sure at the moment alice said gently may ilook round first she began to walk round the shop looking at everything but every time she looked hard at something it seemed tomove and then appear again a moment later in a differentplace so it was difficult to see clearly what was there shewent on walking and soon realized that the shop was muchbigger than she had thought what a strange shop alice said i wish things wouldkeep still a few minutes later the shop became even stranger becausealice found herself walking beside a large lake with tall greenplants growing round the edge she put out her hand to picksome but the plants disappeared when she touched them oh what a pity said alice i would like to take somehome they look so pretty there are lots of other things here said the sheep butyou must decide what you want to buy to buy alice said jumping a little in surprise the lakehad gone and she was back in the little dark shop the sheepwas still knitting and was looking at her crossly over the topof her glasses i would like to buy an egg please alice said howmuch do they cost fivepence for one twopence for two the sheep replied so two are cheaper than one alice said in a surprisedvoice taking out her purse but you must eat them both if you buy two said thesheep then i ll have one please said alice giving the sheepfivepence the sheep took the money then said you must get ityourself you know it s at the end of the shop the end of the shop was very dark and was crowded withtables and chairs alice could see the egg but she neverseemed to get near it she almost fell over a chair and thenrealized that it was not a chair at all but a small tree whyare trees growing here she wondered this is the strangestshop that i ever saw and now here s a little brook as well so she went on wondering more and more at every step af ter a while everything had turned into a tree and she thoughtthat the egg would soon do the same humpty dumpty but the egg got larger and larger and more and morelike a person then alice saw that it had eyes and anose and a mouth and she realized that it was humptydumpty himself it must be him she said to herself there he is sittingon a high wall and he looks just like an egg he was sitting very still and seemed to be asleep so alicestood and repeated to herself the words of the song humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall all the king s horses and all the king s men couldn t put humpty together again don t stand there talking to yourself said humptydumpty suddenly opening his eyes tell me your name my name is alice that s a stupid name said humpty dumpty what doesit mean must a name mean something alice asked puzzled of course it must humpty dumpty said with a shortlaugh my name means the shape i am and a very goodshape it is too with a name like yours you could be almostany shape why do you sit out here all alone said alice not wishingto argue because there s nobody with me cried humpty dumpty did you think i didn t know the answer to that come let shave some intelligent conversation now alice tried to think of something intelligent to say butcouldn t what a beautiful belt you re wearing she said suddenly noticing it that s better said humpty dumpty looking pleased yes it was a present from the white king and queen theygave it to me for an unbirthday present alice looked puzzled what is an unbirthday present a present when it isn t your birthday of course alice thought about this i like birthday presents best shesaid at last you don t know what you re talking about cried humptydumpty how many days are there in a year three hundred and sixty five said alice and how many birthdays have you one and if you take one from three hundred and sixty five what is left three hundred and sixty four of course so there s only one day when you can get birthdaypresents said humpty dumpty but three hundred and six ty four days when you can get unbirthday presents there ssuccess for you i don t know what you mean by success alice said humpty dumpty smiled of course you don t until i tellyou i meant there s a clever idea for you but success doesn t mean a clever idea alice argued when i use a word humpty dumpty said looking downhis nose at alice it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less but can you make words have different meanings askedalice words are difficult things i agree said humptydumpty but you have to be strong with them give them or ders tell them to obey you they must work hard and dowhat they re told he banged his hand excitedly on the wallas he spoke you seem very clever with words sir said alicepolitely hoping to calm him she was worried about himfalling off the wall humpty dumpty looked pleased i can explain mostwords and get them to do what i want he said some ofthem are like suitcases you know they ve got several mean ings packed up in them take poems for example one shortpoem can carry as many meanings as five people s luggage somebody repeated a poem to me earlier today saidalice it was tweedledee i think oh i can repeat any number of poems if you like saidhumpty dumpty well not just at the moment alice said quickly hopingto stop him from beginning this piece was written specially for you humpty dump ty went on not listening to her it will amuse you thank you said alice sadly she could not refuse to lis ten she thought if the poem was specially written for her in winter when the fields are white i sing this song for your delight but i don t sing it he explained yes i can see that alice said if you can see me singing or not singing you ve better eyesthan most people said humpty dumpty alice was silent and he went on in spring when woods are getting green i ll try and tell you what i mean thank you very much said alice in summer when the days are long perhaps you ll understand the song in autumn when the leaves are brown take pen and ink and write it down i will if i can remember it so long said alice don t go on saying things humpty dumpty said they re not sensible and i forget where i am i sent a message to the fish i told them this is what i wish the little fishes of the sea they sent an answer back to me the little fishes answer was we cannot do it sir because i m afraid i don t understand said alice it gets easier as it goes on humpty dumpty replied but the poem went on for a long time and alice thought itgot harder not easier to understand then humpty dumptysuddenly stopped and there was a long silence is that all alice asked politely that s all said humpty dumpty goodbye alice waited a minute but humpty dumpty closed his eyesand did not speak again so she got up said goodbye andquietly walked away what an extraordinary person she said to herself as shewalked i don t think i ever met she never finished whatshe was saying because at that moment a heavy crash shookthe forest from end to end the lion and the unicorn the next moment soldiers came running through thewood at first in twos and threes then ten or twentytogether and at last in great crowds that seemed to fill theforest alice got behind a tree and watched them go past they were very strange soldiers she thought they werealways falling over something or other and when one soldierwent down several more always fell over him soon theground was covered with fallen men then came the horses with four feet they managed betterthan the foot soldiers but even they fell more often than not and when a horse fell the rider always fell off at once it wasalmost like a battle in itself and alice decided it would besafer to move on soon she came to an open place where shefound the white king sitting on the ground busily writing inhis notebook i ve sent them all the king cried happily when he sawalice did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as youcame through the wood yes i did said alice several thousand i think four thousand two hundred and seven the king said looking at his book i couldn t send all the horses becausetwo of them are wanted in the game and i haven t sent themessengers haigha and hatta i need them myself of course to come and go one to come and one to go i don t think i understand said alice why one to comeand one to go i ve told you the king said crossly i must have two to fetch and carry one to fetch and one to carry at that moment haigha one of the messengers arrived he had very large hands and great eyes which were alwaysmoving wildly from side to side what s the news from town said the king i ll whisper it said haigha putting his mouth close tothe king s ear alice was sorry about this because she wanted to hear thenews too but instead of whispering haigha shouted at thetop of his voice they re at it again do you call that a whisper cried the poor king jumpingup and shaking himself don t do that again who are at it again alice asked the lion and the unicorn of course said the king fighting for the crown yes and it s my crown that they re fighting about saidthe king amusing isn t it let s run and see them they began to run and as they went alice repeated to her self the words of the old song the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown the lion beat the unicorn all round the town some gave them white bread and some gave them brown some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town soon they saw a great crowd in front of them and in themiddle the lion and the unicorn were fighting hatta theother messenger was standing at the edge of the crowd witha cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in theother he looked very unhappy he s only just come out of prison haigha whispered inalice s ear so he s very hungry and thirsty you see howare you dear child he said to hatta in a friendly voice hatta looked round but went on eating his bread and butterand drinking his tea come tell us the news cried the king how are theygetting on with the fight they re getting on very well hatta said through amouthful of bread and butter each of them has been down about eighty seven times then i suppose they ll soon bring the white bread and thebrown alice said it s waiting for them now said hatta i m eating a bitof it myself the fight stopped just then and the lion and the unicornsat down looking tired the king called out ten minutes for tea and haighaand hatta began to carry round plates of white and brownbread alice took a piece to taste but it was very dry i don t think they ll fight any more today the king saidto hatta go and order the drums to begin as alice watched him go she suddenly saw somebody run ning out of the wood look she cried excitedly there s the white queen she came flying out of the wood how fast those queens canrun there s probably an enemy after her said the king notlooking round that wood s full of them but aren t you going to help her asked alice very sur prised no use no use said the king she runs so terriblyquickly you can t catch a queen when she s running at that moment the unicorn came past with his hands inhis pockets when he saw alice he stopped and looked at herfor some minutes he did not seem to like what he saw whatisthis he said at last this is a child haigha said helpfully coming forward tointroduce alice we only found it today it s as large as life and twice as natural i always thought they were fantastic monsters said theunicorn is it alive it can talk said haigha the unicorn looked dreamily at alice talk child alice smiled i always thought that unicorns were fantas tic monsters too i never saw one alive before well we have now met and spoken so we can believe ineach other yes the unicorn turned to the king fetchout the plum cake old man i m tried of brown bread certainly certainly said the king sounding a littlefrightened quick haigha open the bag haigha was carrying a big bag round his neck and now hetook ont of it a very large cake a plate and a knife he gavethem to alice to hold the lion had joined them while this was going on helooked very tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut what s this he said looking at alice an what is it then the unicorn cried you ll neverguess i couldn t the lion looked at alice without interest are you a veg etable or an animal he asked tiredly it s a fantastic monster the unicorn cried before alicecould reply then pass round the plum cake monster the lion said lying down on the ground and you two sit down he said tothe king and the unicorn the king looked very uncomforable when he had to sit be tween the lion and the unicorn but there was no other placefor him his crown nearly fell off because he was shaking somuch the unicorn looked amused and then tried to arguewith the lion about who was winning the fight i beat you all round the town said the lion angrily and why is the monster taking so long to cut up the cake it s very difficult said alice i ve cut off several piecesalready but then they join up again immediately you don t know how to manage looking glass cakes saidthe unicorn pass it round first and cut it up afterwards this sounded nonsense but alice got up and carried theplate round at once the cake cut itself into three pieces andthen alice returned to her place with the empty plate look at my piece of cake cried the unicorn the mon ster has given the lion twice as much as me she hasn t kept any for herself said the lion do youlike plum cake monster but before alice could answer the drums began the airseemed full of the noise and it rang and rang through herhead frightened alice began to run and jumped over the brook then she fell to the ground and put her hands over her ears trying to shut out the terrible noise if that doesn t drum the lion and the unicorn out oftown she thought to herself nothing ever will the white knight after a while the noise of the drums slowly died awayand everything became silent alice lifted her head andsaw that she was alone but there lying at her feet was theplate on which she had tried to cut the plum cake so i didn t dream the lion and the unicorn then shesaid to herself but oh dear perhaps we re all part of thesame dream i do hope it s my dream and not the redking s i don t like belonging to another person s dream at this moment there was a loud shout and a knight in redarmour came riding through the forest towards her just as hereached her the horse stopped suddenly you re my prisoner the red knight cried as he fell offhis horse alice was more worried for the knight than for herself buthe got up and slowly climbed back on to his horse he began again to say you re my but then another shout rangthrough the forest alice looked round in surprise this time it was a white knight he rode up to alice andwhen his horse stopped he too fell off at once he got onagain and then the two knights sat and looked at each othersilently alice watched them both feeling very puzzled she s my prisoner you know the red knight said at yes but then i came and saved her the white knightreplied well we must fight for her then said the red knight and he began to put on his helmet which was in the shape of ahorse s head when the white knight had got into his helmet as well thetwo began fighting each other very noisily several times oneknocked the otner off his horse but then always fell off him self alice got behind a tree where she could watch moresafely what a noise their armour makes when they fall off shesaid to herself and how calm the horses are they just standthere like tables while the knights get on and off the battle ended when they both fell off at the same time then they shook hands and the red knight got on his horseand rode away the white knight came up to alice i won that battle easily didn t i he said i don t know said alice uncertainly i don t want tobe anybody s prisoner i want to be a queen so you will when you ve crossed the next brook said thewhite knight i ll see you safe to the end of the woodandthen i must go back you know that s the end of my move thank you very much said alice may i help you takeoff your helmet it was difficult to do but at last the helmet came off ah that s better said the knight he pushed back hislong wild hair with both hands and turned his gentle face andlarge sad eyes to alice he was a very strange looking soldier alice thought hisarmour fitted him very badly and he had a great many thingsfastened to himself and to the horse there was also a smallwooden box on his back which was upside down i see you re looking at my little box the knight said in afriendly voice it s my own invention to keep clothes andsandwiches in you see i carry it upside down and then therain can t get in but the things can get out alice said gently did youknow that the top was open no i didn t the knight said if all the things havefallen out he went on unhappily there s no use keeping thebox he unfastened it as he spoke and put it carefully on thebranch of a tree perhaps some birds will make a home in it now if you re ready what s that plate for it was used for plum cake said alice i think we should take it with us the knight said it llbe useful if we find any plum cake help me to get it into thisbag this took a long time to do because the bag was not reallybig enough and already had a lot of carrots in it but at last itwas done and they started walking through the forest it wasa slow journey because the knight was not a good rider everytime the horse stopped which it did very often he fell off infront when the horse went on again he fell off behind sometimes he fell off sideways as well and alice learnt not towalk too close to the horse perhaps you should have a wooden horse on wheels al ice said with a little laugh as she helped him get back on hishorse for the seventh time do you think so the knight said seriously yes i ll getone one or twoseveral as they went the knight told her about his many inven tions alice listened with great interest but found most ofthem hard to understand she was thinking abut his inven tion for turning fish eyes into buttons when she saw to hersurprise that they had reached the end of the forest you are sad the knight said in a worried voice let mesing you a song to cheer you up is it very long alice asked she felt that she had heard agreat many poems and songs that day it s long said the knight but it s very very beautiful everybody that hears me sing it either they cry or hestopped suddenly or what said alice or they don t you know the song is called i ll tell youeverything i can it s about an old old man that i met onesummer evening long ago while sitting on the grass years afterwads alice could still remember very clearlythose strange momentsthe knight s gentle smile as hesang the sunlight shining on his armour the horse quietlymoving around and the black shadows of the forest behind she stood and listened very carefully but she did not cry itwas a sad song certainly and as the knight came towards theend he seemed lost in his own sad dreams and now if accidentally i put my fingers into glue or try to pusn a right hand foot into a left hand shoe or if i drop upon my toe a very heavy glass i cry as it reminds me so of that old man i used to know whose face was kind whose voice was slow whose hair was whiter than the snow who shook his body to and fro and whispered words both sad and low that summer evening long ago while sitting on the grass as the knight sang the last words he began to turn hishorse round to go back into the forest you ve only a little way to go he said down the hilland over the brook and then you ll be a queen thank you very much for coming so far said alice andfor the song i liked it very much i hope so the knight said worriedly but you didn t cryvery much they shook hands and then the knight rode slowly awayinto the forest alice stood and watched him for a while it won t be long before he falls off again she said to her self yesthere he goes right on his head as usual buthe doesn t seem to mind a bit when he had gone alice turned and ran down the hill now for the last brook and to be a queen how grand itsounds a few steps brought her to the edge of the brook the eighth square at last she cried as she jumped over and sat down to rest on the soft green grass at once she feltsomething very heavy on her head what is this on myhead she said and how did it get there she lifted it off to see what it was it was a golden crown queen alice well this is grand said alice she got up andwalked around for a while but the crown feltvery heavy and strange so she sat down again then she no ticed that the red queen and the white queen were now sit ting on either side of her how they had got there she had noidea but she was not at all surprised nothing could surpriseher now in the looking glass world now i am a queen said alice does this mean that thegame of chess has finished or speak when you re spoken to the red queen said think before you speak and write it down afterwards but i only alice began and you can t be a queen the red queen went on un til you ve done your lessons are you good at sums the white queen asked what s one and one and one and one and one and one and one i don t know said alice i lost count but why she can t do sums said the red queen what about lan guages and can you read of course i can read alice said and i know a littlefrench but i really don t see why it s clear said the white queen shaking her head sadly that she wants to argue about something but she doesn tknow what to argue about alice decided it would be safer to say nothing and for awhile there was silence then the red queen said to thewhite queen i invite you to alice s party this afternoon and i invite you the white queen replied but i musthave a rest first she went on i am so sleepy and so must i said the red queen she looked at alice you can sing to us to help us sleep then the two queens put their heads against alice s shoul ders in a moment they were both asleep and snoring loudly after a while the snoring seemed to change and began tosound almost like music alice thought that she could evenhear some words she listened hard and suddenly she foundthat the queens had disappeared and she was standing infront of a tall and very grand looking doorway above the doorwere the words queen alice in large letters alice knocked and the door flew open there seemed to behundreds of voices singing and alice could now hear thewords very clearly they went like this then fill up the glasses with everything nice and cover the table with buttons and rice put cats in the coffee and salt in the tea and welcome queen alice with thirty times three i suppose i should go in alice said to herself so in shewent and at once everyone in the hall became silent as she walked down the long hall she saw that there wereanimals birds and even a few flowers among the crowd seat ed round the table at the top there were three chairs thered and white queens had taken two of them but the middleone was empty alice sat down feeling a little uncomfortableand wishing that someone would speak at last the red queen began you ve missed the fish bring the meat now and at once the waiters put a large jointof meat in front of alice but before she could begin to cut up the joint the redqueen spoke again let me introduce you to the joint shesaid alice meat meat alice the joint of meat then stood up on the plate and curtsied toalice alice feeling both frightened and amused picked upthe knife and fork may i give you some meat she said looking from one queen to the other certainly not the red queen said it isn t polite to cutanyone you ve been introduced to take away the joint the waiters immediately carried away the joint andbrought a large plum pudding in its place please don t introduce me to the pudding said alicequickly or we shall get no dinner at all but the red queen said loudly puddingalice alice pudding take away the pudding and the waiters took itaway at once then alice decided to give an order herself waiter bringback the pudding when the pudding appeared again shequickly cut off a piece and gave it to the red queen that s really friendly said the pudding how wouldyou like someone to cut a piece out of you alice was too surprised to speak say something said the red queen you can t leave allthe conversation to the pudding by this time the party was beginning to get very noisy andmore and more strange things were happening bottles andplates were now walking around on the table arm in arm andthe white queen began to whisper in alice s ear a long poemabout fishes then the red queen screamed at the top of hervoice let s drink to queen alice s health some of the animals put their glasses upside down on theirheads others got inside them or knocked them over on thetable the forks began to dance with the spoons and the noisegot wilder and wilder the white queen said in alice s ear you must stand up and give thanks now you know alice stood up i must stop all this she cried and shetook hold of the table cloth with both hands one good pull and everything came crashing down on the floor and now for you she went on turning to the redqueen who had suddenly become very much smaller and wasrunning around on the table you started all this trouble and i ll shake you into a kitten yes i will shaking she took the red queen off the table as she spoke andshook her backwards and forwards very hard the red queen did not try to fight or escape but herface grew very small and her eyes got large and green and as alice went on shaking her she grew shorter andfatter and softerand rounder and waking and it really was a kitten after all who dreamed it you shouldn t be so noisy your majesty alicesaid to the black kitten you ve woken me outof a very nice dream i ve been all through the looking glassworld and i think that you were the red queen weren tyou it is impossible to guess if a kitten is saying yes or no alice looked among the chessmen on the table until she foundthe red queen then she sat on the carpet and put the kittenand the queen to look at each other curtsy while you re thinking what to say alice said with a little laugh it saves time remember but the kitten turned its head away and wouldn t look at thequeen now kitty alice went on who was it who dreamed itall do you think no listen don t start washing your pawsnow you see kitty it was either me or the red king hewas part of my dream of course but then i was part of hisdream too was it the red king kitty but the kitten began to wash its other paw and pretended ithadn t heard the question who do you think was dreaming txtba www txtba com david meets his uncle it was early in the month of june when i shut the door of our house behind me for the last time all my life i had lived in the quiet little village of essendean in the lowlands of scotland where my father had been the dominie or schoolteacher but now that he and my mother were both dead i had to leave the house the new dominie would soon arrive and he would teach at the school and live in the dominie s house so although i was only seventeen there was nowhere for me to live and no reason for me to stay in essendean but my heart was beating with excitement as i walked down the road because in my hand i carried the letter that my father had given me just before he died davie he had said when i am dead take this to the house of shaws near cramond that s where i came from and that s where you must go put this letter into the hands of ebenezer balfour balfour the same name as my own it was the first time i had heard of any of our family outside essendean so i decided to walk to cramond hoping that perhaps this mr balfour in his fine big house would receive me kindly and help me to become a rich man one day with my plaid over my shoulder i walked fast up the hill away from the village what an adventure to leave that sleepy place where nothing ever happened and go to a great busy house to be with rich and important people of my own name and blood but when i reached the top of the hill i turned a little sadly to take my last look at the dominie s house and essendean churchyard where my father and mother lay my journey northwards took almost two days by midday on the second day i could see the smoking chimneys of edinburgh in front of me and soon i arrived in cramond now i began to ask people on the road for the house of shaws their answers worried me a little some people seemed surprised some afraid and some angry when i spoke the name of ebenezer balfour i could not understand this but it was too far to go back to essendean that day and i wanted to find the rest of the balfour family very much so i continued on my way and when i met a dark wild looking woman coming towards me i asked her where the house of shaws was she took me to the top of the next hill and showed me a large building standing alone in the bottom of the next valley although the fields around were green and the farmland was excellent the house itself looked unfinished and empty part of its roof was missing there was no road to it and no smoke coming from any of its chimneys nor was there any garden that i cried no it can t be it is cried the woman angrily that is the house of shaws blood built it blood stopped the building of if and blood shall bring it down black is the heart of ebenezer balfour ye can tell him from me that i hope to see him die and his house fall down around him the woman turned and disappeared i stood where she left me shaking like a leaf and looking down at the house for a long time but when it began to get dark i noticed some smoke coming out of the chimney and felt a little more hope ful there must be a fire and cooking and people in the house i thought so i walked up to the front door the house seemed locked up and unwelcoming but there was fire light shining through the kitchen window and i could hear someone talking quietly to himself bravely i lifted my hand and knocked loudly on the strong wooden door the house was suddenly silent and there was no reply i knocked and knocked and shouted as loudly as i could finally the win dow opened and a man holding a gun put his head out what do ye want he asked i ve come here with a letter for mr ebenezer balfour of shaws is he here who is it from asked the man with the gun that s none of your business i replied getting angry well put the letter down by the door and leave i will not i answered sharply i m going to give it to mr balfour himself the letter introduces me to him who are ye then was the next question i m not ashamed of my name it s david balfour the man almost dropped his gun after a long while he asked in a changed voice is your father dead i was too surprised to answer but he continued aye he must be dead and that s why ye have come well man i ll let ye in and he disappeared from the window now the door was unlocked and a voice from the darkness said go into the kitchen and touch nothing i obeyed while the man locked the heavy door carefully again i found myself in the emptiest kitchen that i had ever seen there was a fire but no other light on the table was a bowl of porridge and a glass of water in front of the only chair around the walls were several locked chests there was no other furniture the man who now appeared in the kitchen was small mean looking and white faced between fifty and sev enty years old and wearing a dirty old nightshirt the worst thing about him was that he could neither take his eyes away from me nor look straight into my face if ye re hungry he said ye can eat that porridge it s grand food porridge let me see the letter it s for mr balfour not you i replied and who do ye think i am give me alexander s letter ye may not like me or my house or my porridge but i m your born uncle davie my man this was the end of all my hopes i was too tired and miser able to speak so i silently gave him the letter and sat down to eat the porridge your father s been dead a long time he asked giving me a quick look from his sharp eyes three weeks sir i said he was a secretive man alexander was perhaps he didn t talk much about me or about the house of shaws i never knew he had a brother sir or ever heard the name of shaws to think of that he replied a strange man but he seemed very pleased and began to look at me with more inter est soon he jumped up and said we re going to get on well davie what s mine is yours man and what s yours is mine blood s thicker than water and there s only ye and me of the name of balfour now i ll show ye to your bed he took me up some dark stairs and showed me into a room i could not see anything can i have a light sir i asked no ye can t no lights in this house i m afraid of fires ye see good night to ye davie my man and before i had time to reply he pulled the door shut and locked it from the outside the room was very cold but luckily i had my plaid with me so i covered myself with it like a blanket and soon fell asleep the next day my uncle and i had a small bowl of porridge and a glass of water for breakfast lunch and supper he did not speak much to me but was clearly thinking hard i often noticed him looking at me while pretending to do something different and he never left me alone in the kitchen with the locked chests in which i supposed he kept his money i did not like the way he looked at me and began to wonder if he was a little crazy and perhaps dangerous after supper he said suddenly davie i ve been thinking i promised your father a bit of money for ye before ye were born a promise is a promise and so i m going to give ye forty pounds these last words seemed very painful to him he added in a kind of scream scots a scottish pound was the same as an english shilling i could see that his story was a lie so i laughed at him saying oh think again sir english pounds surely that s what i said replied my uncle quickly go outside for a moment and i ll get the money for ye i was smiling as i went out sure that he would give me nothing at all it was a dark night and i could hear wind in the hills there may be thunder later i thought not knowing how important the weather would be to me that night but when my uncle called me in again he counted thirty eight english pounds in gold into my hands it clearly hurt him to do it and he kept back the last two pounds but i did not mind that surprised and pleased i thanked him warmly now he said looking cleverly at me ye can give me something davie i m getting old now and i need help of course sir i answered what can i do well go outside and climb the stairs at the other end of the house where the building isn t finished yet go up to the room at the top and bring down the chest that ye ll find there it s got valuable papers in it can i have a light sir i asked no he said sharply no lights in my house very well sir are the stairs good they re grand said he the stairs are grand out i went into the night as i was feeling my way along the outside wall there was a sudden flash of lightning then darkness again i found the stairs and started climbing i was about fifteen metres above the ground when there was another flash of lightning that was lucky for me because it showed me that the steps were uneven and that i could easily fall to my death these are the grand stairs i thought perhaps my uncle wants me to die now i was very careful and i felt each step with my hands before i put my foot on it a few steps later my hand felt cold stone and then nothing more the stairs ended there twenty metres above the ground i felt cold with fear when i thought of the danger that i had been in sending a stranger up those stairs in the dark was sending him straight to his death angrily i turned and felt my way down there was a crash of thunder and suddenly the rain came down at the bottom of the stairs i looked towards the kitchen and could see in the next flash of lightning a figure standing still in the doorway listening when the thunder sounded again louder than before he ran back inside and i followed as softly as i could i found him sitting in the kitchen drinking whisky straight from the bottle and shaking with fear quietly i came up behind him and putting my hands sud denly on his shoulders cried ah my uncle gave a kind of broken cry and fell to the floor like a dead man his face was a strange blue colour and i began to think that he really was dead at last his eyes opened and he looked up and saw me oh man are ye alive or a ghost he cried get me my medicine davie it s for my heart i found the medicine bottle and gave him some he soon began to look a little better why did you lie to me i asked angrily why did you give me money and why did you try to kill me answer me i ll tell ye tomorrow davie i promise help me to bed now will ye he still looked very ill so i could not refuse but this time i locked his bedroom door and went to sleep in front of the kitchen fire when i woke up in the morning i felt very pleased with myself he thinks he s cleverer than me but he isn t i thought when i let my uncle out of his room i asked him again for an explanation after a while he said davie i have some business with a ship s captain at queensferry now we could walk over there and when i ve done my business we could visit the lawyer mr rankeillor he ll answer all your questions he s an honest man and he knew your father what do ye say to that i thought for a moment i had never seen the sea but had always wanted to it s a grand idea i said it was a morning s walk to queensferry which was west of edinburgh but we did not say a word to each other on the way suddenly at the top of a hill we could see the firth of forth below us blue and calm with white sails on it ye see that public house asked my uncle captain hoseason s there to do business with me there s the ship s boat on the beach waiting to take him to the ship and there s the ship itself a grand ship i had to agree with him the sailors were getting the ship ready for sailing and i thought what an exciting adventure that would be to sail away to a foreign country we walked down the hill to the public house and met the captain there he was a tall dark serious looking man who shook hands politely with me stupidly i left these two men to their business and ran down to the beach to talk to the sailors and look at the boats it was all new and very interest ing to me as i was coming back i met the owner of the public house good morning he said did ye come with ebenezer i did i replied he isn t well liked i understand that s true he answered nobody speaks well of him it all started with that story about mr alexander his brother what story i asked oh just that ebenezer had killed him did ye never hear that and why would he kill my f i mean alexander to get the house of course the house of shaws aye man was my was alexander older than ebenezer indeed he was no other reason for killing him this was a great surprise to me i had thought that my fa ther was the younger brother and i now understood why my uncle had lied to me and wanted to kill me the house of shaws had belonged to my father not my uncle and now i had inherited it the poor country boy who had walked from essendean was the owner of a fine house and farmland my head was full of the wonderful things that i could do in my life as i looked unseeing at the sea just then my uncle and the captain came out of the public house the captain smiled in a friendly way as he spoke to me sir he said mr balfour has told me a lot about ye i m only sorry i haven t time to get to know ye better but i d like ye to come on to my ship for half an hour before we sail and have a drink with me now more than anything in the world i wanted to see the inside of a ship but i remembered that i had to be careful my uncle and i have to see the lawyer sir i replied so i m afraid we may not have enough time aye aye he answered i know but ye see the ship s boat can put ye both down near rankeillor s house after ye ve seen the ship so ye won t lose any time suddenly he said quietly in my ear watch out for the old man he wants to hurt ye come and talk about it putting his arm in mine he said loudly what can i bring ye back from my travels a friend of mr balfour s is a friend of mine by this time we were on the beach and he was helping my uncle and me into the boat i thought that i had found a good friend and helper and i was very excited as we came closer to the great ship full of busy noisy sailors the captain and i were the first to climb up the ship s side and at the top the captain immediately put his arm through mine and began to talk about the ship but where is my uncle i asked suddenly i pulled myself away from the captain s arm and ran to the side of the ship sure enough there was the boat returning to queensferry with my uncle sitting in it i screamed help help murder and my uncle slowly turned to look at me i did not see any more already strong hands were pulling me away then something hit my head i saw a great flash of fire and fell to the ground kidnapped when i woke up in darkness my head was hurting badly and i was unable to move my hands or feet i could hear the sailors shouts and the sound of the wind and the waves the whole world seemed to go up up up and then down again i felt very ill and at first could not under stand what was happening after a while i realized that i must be somewhere inside the ship which was moving very fast through the water i ve been kidnapped i thought angrily it was clear that my uncle and the captain had planned it together i began to feel frightened and hopeless as i lay there in the dark some hours later a light shone in my face mr riach one of the ship s officers stood looking down at me he washed the cut on my head gave me some water and told me kindly to go to sleep the next time he came i was feeling very hot and ill he had brought captain hoseason with him now sir see for yourself said mr riach the lad s seriously ill we must take him out of this unhealthy hole at once that s none of your business answered the captain ye re paid to do your job not to worry about the by he s staying down here i m only paid to be an officer on this ship replied mr riach sharply he looked hard at the captain i m not paid like you to kidnap and murder hoseason turned on him angrily what did ye say be cried what do ye mean you understand said mr riach looking calmly at him you should know me by now mr riach i m a hard man but if ye say the lad will die aye he will said mr riach well sir put him where ye like so i was carried up into the sunlight a few minutes later and put in a cabin where some of the sailors were sleeping it was a wonderful feeling to see the daylight and to be able to talk to people again i lay in the cabin for several days and after a while began to feel better the sailors were kind to me in their way they brought me food and drink and told me about their families at home i discovered from them that the ship was sailing to the carolinas in north america there the captain was planning to sell me as a slave to work in a rich man s house or on a farm i also learnt that both the ship s officers mr riach and mr shuan enjoyed drinking far too much the sailors liked mr shuan but said that he was sometimes violent when he had drunk a lot one of the sailors was a young boy called ransome his job was to bring meals to the captain and officers in the round house a big cabin on the top of the ship where the officers slept and ate when ransome dropped something or did something wrong mr shuan used to hit him and i often saw the poor boy crying one night about nine o clock i heard one of the sailors in the cabin saying quietly to the others shuan s killed him at last we all knew who he meant just then the captain came in i was surprised to see him walk towards me and say kindly my man we want ye to help us in the round house from now on ye ll sleep there instead of ransome as he spoke two sailors carried ransome into the cabin his face was as white as a sheet and he did not move my blood ran cold when i saw him i obeyed the captain and ran to the round house it was a large room with a table a bench and locked cupboards all the best food and drink was kept there under the captain s eyes as well as the guns when i entered i saw mr shuan sitting at the table with a bottle of whisky in front of him he did not seem to notice what was happening around him and was looking fixedly at the table mr riach soon joined the captain and me he looked at hoseason meaningfully and i understood from his look that ransome was dead we three all stood silently looking down at mr shuan suddenly the captain stepped forward do ye know what ye ve done he cried ye ve murdered the boy mr shuan put a hand to his head well he said he brought me a dirty glass the captain and mr riach and i looked at each other almost frightened then hoseason took mr shuan by the arm and told him to go to bed the murderer cried a little at first but he took off his boots and lay down like a small child mr riach said the captain when we could see that mr shuan was asleep nobody on land must know what happened tonight we ll say that the boy fell into the sea get us a drink david we both need one and he gave me the key to the cupboards in the next few days i was very busy running here and there with the officers food and drink mr riach and the cap tain were surprisingly patient with me when i made mistakes perhaps they were thinking of the poor boy who had died but mr shuan was very strange after ransome s death he did not seem to know what he had done or to recognize me on my second day in the round house he looked at me with a white face and fear in his eyes you weren t here before he asked no sir i replied there was another boy he asked ah yes i thought so and sitting down he called for some more whisky it wasn t a hard life for me i was able to eat well and talk to mr riach who spoke to me like a friend but i could not forget poor ransome as the days passed i became more and more worried i knew that when the ship arrived in the carolinas i would no longer be a free man but a slave i thought hard but there did not seem to be any way of escaping about a week later we were sailing round the rocky coast of northern scotland in very bad weather it was difficult to see anything because of the thick fog one evening there was a great crash and the officers ran out to see what had happened i thought we had hit a rock but in fact it was a small boat as we watched the boat broke in two and went to the bottom with all its men except the one passenger at the moment of the crash this man managed to jump up and catch the side of the ship and pull himself up the captain brought him into the round house he was smallish but well built with an open sunburnt face and bright amused eyes when he took off his long coat i could see that he had a pair of pistols and was wearing a sword at his side although his life had clearly been in great danger he seemed very calm and spoke politely to the captain hoseason was looking with interest at the man s clothes he was wear ing a hat with feathers a blue coat with silver buttons and expensive looking lace round his neck i m sorry about the boat sir said the captain i ve lost some grand friends today replied the stranger and that s worse than losing ten boats well sir there are more men in the world than boats replied the captain still watching him closely i know be cause i ve been in france like you he said these last words clearly and carefully they seemed to have a special meaning the stranger put his hand quickly on his pistol don t worry said hoseason ye ve a french soldier s coat on your back and a scottish tongue in your head that s true but so has many an honest man these days well sir replied the stranger i must tell you that i m one of those honest highlanders who were proud to fight for their homes their clan and their country in against the english king and i must tell you another thing if king george s soldiers find me i ll be in trouble i was on my way to france where some of my clansmen live now but in the fog my boat missed the french ship that was meeting me so if you can take me to france i ll pay you well he opened his purse and showed that it was full of gold coins the captain seemed excited as he looked at the money and then at the man s face to france he replied no i can t do that but to the highlands aye we can discuss that they sat down together and in the end agreed that the captain would take the stranger to loch linnhe on the northwest coast of scot land for sixty pounds there the highlander would be among friends and safe from the english army he and hoseason shook hands and the captain left me alone with the stranger he had told the captain that the gold was not his own some of the highlanders had escaped to france after the forty five but their friends and clansmen in scotland sometimes managed to find a little money to send them it was this man s job to take the money across to france and he did this by travelling secretly to scotland as often as possible i thought he was very brave if he s caught by the english army they ll kill him i told myself i liked the way he seemed to enjoy living dangerously when he asked me for whisky i had to go to ask the cap tain for the key to the cupboard i found hoseason and his officers talking quietly in a corner and heard them planning to kill the stranger and steal his money they seemed to think that i would help them and asked me to bring them secretly some guns from the round house i went slowly back to the stranger not sure what i should do but when i entered the round house and saw him eating his supper i decided at once they re going to attack you and murder you i told him what he cried jumping up will ye stand with me against them i will i m no thief or murderer i replied bravely are ye for king george more or less i answered well mr more or less what s your name david balfour i said and then thinking that a man with so fine a coat must like fine people i added of shaws my name is stewart he said proudly alan breck they call me and stewart is a king s name so it s good enough for me although i have no name of a farmhouse to add to it he looked around him now david i ll take any man who comes in through this door you must watch the window and the door behind me and shoot anyone who tries to enter he gave me a pistol i was very frightened but tried hard not to show it the ship seemed very quiet suddenly there was the sound of running feet and a shout and then i heard fighting in the doorway i looked over my shoulder and saw mr shuan just as alan drove his sword into the officer s body then several men ran at my door i did not want to hurt them but it was now or never i lifted my pistol and shot at them one man fell and the others ran away after a few moments the sailors attacked again alan fought as bravely as before his sword now red with blood he was clearly enjoying himself i had no time to think but when two more men appeared at the window i shot them too now there were several bodies on the floor and blood everywhere suddenly i realized that we had won and that the danger was over alan was driving the men out of the round house like sheep when he returned he took me in his arms david he cried i love ye like a brother and oh man am i not a grand fighter i had to agree he took a knife from the table and cut a silver button off his blue coat take this david the buttons come from my father duncan stewart where ye show that button the friends of alan breck will come to ye he spoke as proudly as a king and i tried not to smile we slept in the round house one of us keeping watch all night and the next morning the captain came to speak to us ye veve won the fight sir he said to alan we re sailing through the little minch now and i ll keep my promise to take ye to loch linnhe but ye ve killed my chief officer shuan and without him i can t find my way safely round these rocky coasts we ll go round the island of mull but i warn ye it ll be dangerous hoseason was right to be worried all that day alan and i sat in the round house and told each other the stories of our lives but by night the wind was growing stronger and the sailors found it hard to keep the ship away from the dangerous rocks as we came round earraid a small island close to the larger island of mull there was a sudden terrible crash and we realized that the ship had hit a rock there was only one thing to do leave the ship and try to reach land in the ship s boat but as we were climbing down into the boat a great wave hit the ship and knocked some of us into the sea i went down and came up again several times then luckily i managed to find a piece of wood which helped me to stay up in the water i looked round but could not see alan or any of the sailors or the boat my only hope was to try to swim to earraid which i could see not far away in the moonlight it was hard tiring work but i reached it and was very grateful to step on to dry land at last david is alone it was a cold night so i could not sit down to rest in stead i walked up and down on the beach trying to keep warm there was no sound except the crash of the waves i felt very lonely and afraid in the morning i climbed a hill and looked out over the sea but there was nothing at all on the water and around me on the island i could not see any houses or people i did not like to think what had happened to my friend alan and the others and i did not want to look at this emptiness any longer so i climbed down again and walked eastwards i was hoping to find a house where i could dry my clothes and get something to eat i soon discovered that nobody lived on earraid it was too far to swim to mull which could see across the water i thought perhaps i could wade across but when i tried it the water was too deep and i had to turn back by now it had started to rain and i felt very miserable then i remembered the piece of wood which had already saved my life once it would help me to get across the sea to mull so i walked all the way back to the beach where i had arrived the piece of wood was in the sea so i waded into the water to get it but as i came closer it moved away from me and when the water was too deep for me to stand the piece of wood was still several metres away i had to leave it and went back to the beach it was a terrible moment for me i was feeling very tired hungry and thirsty with no hope of getting away from this lonely island for the first time since leaving essendean i lay down and cried i do not want to remember the time that i spent on earraid i had nothing with me except my uncle s gold and alan s silver button and as i had never lived near the sea i did not know what to eat or how to fish in fact i found some shellfish among the rocks on the coast and ate them but i was very sick afterwards that was the only food that i could find so i was always hungry on earraid all day and all night it rained heavily but there was no roof or tree on the island and my clothes were cold and wet on my body i chose to spend most of my time in the north of earraid on a little hill from here i could see the old church on the island of iona not far away to the west and smoke from people s houses on mull to the east i used to watch this smoke and think of the people there and their comfortable lives this gave me a little hope in my lonely life among the rocks and the rain and the cold sea two days passed and on the third day two things happened first i discovered that i had lost almost all my money through a hole in my pocket i only had three of my uncle s thirty eight pounds left but worse was to come while i was sitting on a rock looking out over iona i suddenly noticed a small boat moving fast through the water i jumped to my feet and shouted as loudly as i could the two men in the boat were near enough to hear they shouted back in gaelic and laughed but the boat did not turn and sailed on right in front of my eyes to iona i could not understand why they did not come to help me i continued shouting wildly although i could no longer see them and then i lay down and cried for the second time this time i wasn t sad but angry because i thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place the next morning i was surprised to see that the same men were sailing towards earraid from iona at once i ran down to the rocky coast to meet them the boat came near me but stayed a few metres away in the water there was a third man in the boat who was talking and laughing with the others then he stood up and spoke fast to me in gaelic which i could not understand but sometimes he used an english word and once i heard the word tide this gave me a flash of hope do you mean that when the tide is low i cried and could not finish yes yes he called back tide and laughed again i turned my back on the boat and ran back excitedly to the east of the island where earraid was the closest to mull and sure enough there was now only a little water between the is lands i was able to wade through it easily and reached mull with a happy shout how stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to mull twice a day at low tide now i felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem and coming back to help me i walked towards the smoke that i had seen so often from earraid and reached a long low house built of stone outside sat an old man smoking his pipe in the sun he spoke a little english and told me that the officers and sailors from the ship had all arrived there safely a few days before was one of them dressed in fine clothes i asked aye there was one like that he smiled ye must be the lad with the silver button why yes i said surprised well then your friend says that ye must follow him to the house of his clansman james stewart in appin he and his wife gave me food and drink and let me sleep that night in their house in the morning i thanked them for their kindness and started my journey to appin i walked across mull to torosay where i took a boat across the water to lochaline then i walked to kingairlock where i took another boat across loch linnhe to appin this took six days and on my way i met and spoke to a number of travellers i heard all about alan s clan the stewarts and their enemies the campbells although they were both high land clans the campbells and stewarts had hated each other for years and now the campbells were helping the english army drive many highlanders out of their homes indeed in a day or two i heard red haired colin campbell himself was com ing to appin with king george s soldiers to drive the stew arts out and so destroy his enemies but i heard also of james stewart head of the stewart clan in appin and that he and his clansmen would dearly love to see colin campbell dead people also talked of a man called alan breck some called him a murderer others said that he was a brave fighter he was in danger every time he returned to the highlands be cause the english would pay a good price for him dead or alive i listened with interest to everything that they told me but i liked it best when i heard alan described as a fine man and an honest highlander when i got out of the boat in appin i sat down among some trees to decide what to do next should i go on and join alan whose friends were king george s enemies and whose life was full of danger or should i go back south again quietly and safely to the lowlands as i was thinking four men on horses came past me on the road as soon as i saw these men i decided to continue my adventure although i cannot explain why i stopped the first man who was tall and red haired could you tell me the way to james stewart s house sir i asked all the men looked at each other the red haired man did not reply but spoke to one of the others who looked like a lawyer is stewart calling his people together do ye think the lawyer replied we d better wait here for the sold iers to join us before we go any further the red haired man i suddenly realized must be colin campbell himself if you re worried about me i said i m not a stewart but a lowlander and i m for king george that s well said replied campbell but if i may ask why is an honest lowlander like you so far from his home today is not a good day for travelling this is the day when the appin stewarts have to leave their farms and there may be trouble he was turning to speak to the lawyer again when there came a sudden bang from the hill and campbell fell off his horse they ve shot me he cried holding his heart he died almost immediately the men s faces were white as they looked down at his body i saw something move on the hill and noticed among the trees a man with a gun turning away from the road look the murderer i cried and began to run up the hill towards him he saw me chasing him and went faster soon he disappeared behind a rock and i could no longer see him i stopped next to some trees then i heard a voice below on the road the lawyer was shouting to a large number of redcoated soldiers who had just joined the men around campbell s dead body ten pounds if ye catch that lad he cried he s one of the murderers he stopped us in the road to give the killer a better chance to shoot campbell now i felt a new kind of fear my life was in serious danger although i had not done anything wrong my mouth felt dry and for a moment i could not move i stood there in the open on the hill while the soldiers lifted their guns ready to shoot jump in here among the trees said a voice near me i did not know what i was doing but i obeyed as i did so i heard the banging of the guns and realized that the sol diers were shooting at me in the shadow of the trees i found alan breck standing there it was he who had spoken to me escape through the heather we had no time for conversation come alan said and started running along the side of the hill keeping low to the ground i followed him like a sheep we ran and ran faster than i had ever run before and my heart was beat ing wildly sometimes to my surprise alan straightened his back and showed himself to the soldiers who were chasing us after fifteen minutes alan stopped lay flat in the heather and turned to me now he said this is serious do what i do if ye don t want to die and just as fast but much more carefully and secretly we went back almost the same way that we had come at last we arrived back in the wood where i had found alan we fell down in the heather and lay without moving for a long time my legs hurt my head was aching and i thought i was dead alan was the first to speak well he said that was hot work david i said nothing i had seen murder done i knew that colin campbell had been alan s greatest enemy and i had found alan hiding in the wood although i didn t think that he had actually shot campbell i felt sure that he had planned the killing i coult not look at him are ye still tired he asked no i replied my face turned away from him no i m not tired now alan i can t stay with you i must leave you i liked you very much but we re two different people that s all ye must explain what ye mean by that david said alan looking very serious alan why do you ask you know very well that colin campbell is lying dead in the road in his own blood alan was silent for a moment well mr balfour of shaws he said at last i promise ye that i did not plan the murder or know anything about it thank god for that i cried and offered him my hand he did not appear to see it i don t know why ye re so worried about a dead campbell he said i know that you hate their clan alan but taking a life in cold blood is a terrible thing to do do you know who did it i wouldn t recognize him again said alan shaking his head sadly i m good at forgetting david i had to laugh at that then i remembered something but when we were running away you showed yourself to the sol diers to give the murderer a chance to escape any highlander would do that the best place for the lad who shot colin campbell is the heather and we must all do what we can to help him keep away from the soldiers i shook my head at this these highlanders were strange wild people to be sure but alan was ready to die for what he thought was right and i liked him for that i offered him my hand again and this time he took it now david he said we must escape too the campbells will accuse us both of the murder but we didn t do it i cried we can prove that in court man i m surprised at ye said alan do ye not know that if a campbell is killed the accused has to go to court in inveraray in the heart of campbell country when the campbell lawyers have finished with ye ye ll be dead this frightened me a little all right alan i said i ll go with you but remember said alan it ll be a hard life ye ll have to sleep in the open air and ye ll often have an empty stomach ye can choose either live in the heather with me or die at the hands of the campbells that s easy to decide i said and we shook hands on it when we looked between the trees we could just see the redcoats of the soldiers still moving away from us across the hills alan smiled and told me that we would go first to the house of his clansman james stewart and then to the low lands the campbells and the english soldiers would not think of looking for us there and alan could find a place on a ship sailing to france we walked for several hours and arrived that night at a large house in a valley there were lights in all the windows and people were running in and out of the open doors alan whistled three times and we were met at the door by a tall good looking man of about fifty who welcomed us in gaelic james stewart said alan i ll ask ye to speak in english because my friend here comes from the lowlands and cannot speak gaelic james spoke politely to me for a few moments but soon he turned back to alan with a very worried look on his face this is a terrible accident he said it will bring trouble to all of us well man said alan ye should be grateful that colin campbell is dead aye replied james but he was killed in appin remem ber that alan so it s the appin stewarts who ll be accused and i m a man with a family i looked around me men with white frightened faces were hurrying here and there without any clear idea of what they ought to do first some were hiding guns and swords while others were burning papers when james saw me looking sur prised he explained the soldiers ll search my house first ye see and i don t want them to find anything we went inside and met james s wife and children who were crying in a corner i felt very sorry for them but we did not have much time to talk alan explained what we needed for our escape and soon james s men brought us two swords two pistols some food a cooking pot and a bottle of whisky we needed money too because alan had given his gold to an other man to take to france but james had only a little to give us ye must find a safe place somewhere near he said and send me a message i ll find some more money for ye and send it to ye but alan and here he stopped for a moment biting his finger worriedly i ll have to accuse ye of killing that campbell i ll have to if i don t they ll accuse me i have to think of myself and my family do ye see that aye said alan slowly i see that and i ll have to accuse your friend from the lowlands too ye see that alansay that ye see that alan s face went red it s hard on me james i brought him here and now my friends accuse him of murder but just think alan man cried james the campbells will be sure to accuse him and i have children well sir said alan turning to me what do ye say if ye do not agree i won t let james do it i cannot understand why we don t accuse the man who did kill campbell i replied sharply but accuse me mr stewart if you like accuse alan accuse king george i am alan s friend and if i can help his friends in any way i don t mind the danger so that night we started our long journey to the lowlands sometimes we walked and sometimes we ran but although we travelled as fast as we could daylight began to appear before we had found a good hiding place we were in the rocky valley of glencoe with high mountains on both sides and a river running fast through the middle alan was clearly worried the soldiers will find us easily here he said he looked around and saw a great rock about seven metres high with difficulty we both climbed to the top of it then i saw why he had chosen it the top of the rock was shaped like a plate and there was room for two or three men to lie there hidden from people in the valley at last alan smiled aye he said now we have a chance ye can sleep for a while i ll watch for soldiers but when i woke up several hours later the valley was full of redcoats and alan was looking worried again if they go up the sides of the mountains they ll see us he said we ll just have to stay here and hope they don t when it s dark we ll try to get past them that was a terrible day we lay on the rock baking in the sun with no water only whisky to drink we could hear the english voices of the soldiers all around us but luckily they did not look up at our rock in the afternoon when the soldiers seemed sleepy after their lunch we decided to try to escape and we climbed very quietly down from the rock the soldiers did not notice us as we moved carefully from rock to rock and soon we were safely in the next valley that evening we washed ourselves in the river and ate cold porridge which is a good meal for a hungry man we continued walking eastwards all night over the great dark mountains alan was very pleased that we had left the soldiers behind and whistled happily as he walked before daylight we reached a cave that alan had used before and here we stayed hidden for five days alan went down one night to the nearest village to the housc of one of his clansmen he sent this man to james stewart to tell him where we were hiding and after three days the clansman re turned with a purse of money for us and a message from mrs stewart we discovered that james was already in prison ac cused of murder although people were saying that alan breck had actually fired the shot and there was a price of one hun dred pounds on my head as well as on alan s i began to think that i would be safer alone alan was very recognizable in his fine french clothes it was going to be dan gerous to stay with alan and expensive too mrs stewart had only managed to send five pounds and alan had to travel as far as france but i still had two pounds and only needed to reach queensferry so i would have to give some of my money to alan staying with alan meant both danger and ex pense but my honest friend did not think in this way at all he felt sure that he was helping me so what could i do except keep quiet and hope that everything would be all right we started travelling again across the mountains and by daylight came to wild open moors covered with purple heather because anyone on the hills around us could easily see us when we stood up we had to walk or run on our hands and feet like animals it was another hot summer day and my back achcd badly after a few hours i wanted a rest and a drink of water but when we stopped we saw the redcoats of soldiers on one of the hills and we had to go on we walked or ran all day and all night people who talk of tiredness do not know what the word really means i did not know who i was or where i was going and i did not care i thought that every step would be my last and i hoped that death would come soon alan drove me onwards and i felt that i hated him but i was too afraid of him to stop and rest when daylight returned we were stupid with tiredness and had become careless suddenly three or four wild looking men jumped out of the heather and took us prisoner i was not afraid only happy to stop running for a moment but alan spoke to them in gaelic these are cluny macpherson s men he said quietly to me ye remember him the head of the macpherson clan they fought well against the english in the forty five after that he didn t go to france like the other clan chiefs no he s been hiding here ever since and the soldiers have never managed to find him his clansmen bring him what he needs we were taken to a cave well hidden by trees and rocks and cluny macpherson himself came forward to welcome us like a king in his palace he seemed to live well in his cave and he offered us an excellent meal prepared by his cook but i was too tired to eat so i lay down at once and slept in fact although i did not know it i was seriously ill and could not get up for two days i woke up once in a kind of fog to find cluny and alan playing cards and a second time to hear alan asking to borrow my money i was too sick and sleepy to refuse and gave him my purse but when i woke up again on the third day i felt much better although not very strong i noticed that alan was looking very ashamed and i realized at once what had hap pened david he said miserably i ve lost all our money at cards yours as well as mine no no ye haven t lost it cried cluny of course i ll give your money back it was just a game i wouldn t keep your money here and he pulled gold coins out of his pocket i did not know if it was right to accept the money or not but we needed it so i thanked cluny and put the coins in my purse but i was very angry with alan and as we left cluny s cave and continued our journey i refused to speak to him at first alan tried hard to talk to me he said that he was sorry and that he loved me like a brother he was worried about my health and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill but after two or three days when he realized that i was still angry with him he too became angry and laughed at me when i fell or seemed tired we travelled by night through endless rain and strong winds and slept in the wet heather by day i was feeling more and more miserable my illness had returned and i was beginning to think that this terrible journey would only end in my death alan will be sorry when i die i thought how childish i was alan continued to laugh at me and call me names and by the sixth night i had had enough i stopped and spoke angrily to him mr stewart i said why do you laugh at me i should laugh at you you may have a king s name but you re a loser you spend your life running away you re not brave enough to fight the campbells and the english and win alan looked sharply at me david he said there are things that ye should never say things that can never be for gotten if you don t like what i say i m ready to fight i answered stupidly i knew that i was not strong enough to hold a sword david he cried are ye crazy i cannot fight ye it would be murder he pulled out his sword and looked at me no i can t i can t he said and he dropped his sword on the ground when i saw how much he loved me i was no longer angry only sick and sorry i remembered all his kindness to me and how he had always helped me through difficult times now i had lost that friend for ever my illness seemed to get worse and worse and i could only just stand i wanted to say that i was sorry but i knew it was too late for that suddenly i realized that a cry for help was the only way of bringing alan back to me alan i said my voice shaking if you cannot help me i must just die here i did not need to pretend he looked up quickly surprised can ye walk not without help alan if i die will you forget what i said in my heart i ve always been your friend you know that quiet cried alan don t talk of dying david man ye know he could not go on but put his arm around me davie i m a bad friend to ye i didn t remember that ye re just a bairn i couldn t see that ye were dying on your feet he was almost crying hold on to me davie and ye ll be grand he helped me down into the valley to the nearest house which luckily belonged to a clan who were friendly to the stewarts there i lay for several days unable to move alan refused to leave me and took the greatest care of me little by little i got better with his help and before a month had passed we went on our way again this time we did not argue we did not see any more soldiers and our journey was easier now we walked through the warm summer nights ate our porridge drank our whisky and slept in the dry heather in the daytime now that we were in the lowlands we were almost safe and we both felt happy and hopeful when we crossed the forth river by boat from limekilns we were only five kilometres from queensferry where mr rankeillor lived david comes home we decided that alan would stay hidden in the fields while i walked to queensferry to find mr rankeillor alan promised not to come out until he heard me return in order to be sure that it was me he taught me to whistle a little gaelic song i have never forgotten it i think that it will run in my head when i lie dying every time it comes to me i think of that last day of my travels with alan whistling oppo site me in the grass while the first light of the sun touched his face soon i arrived in queensferry when i saw people looking strangely at me and realized how dirty my clothes were i be gan to feel afraid would mr rankeillor want to talk to me how could i prove who i was i had no papers with me i was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help so i walked up and down not knowing what to do by midday i was tired and hungry i stopped in front of a large house with clean windows flowers in the garden and a dog sitting on the doorstep suddenly the door opened and a large well dressed kind looking man came out what are you doing here my lad he asked i m looking for mr rankeillor s house sir i answered well i m rankeillor and this is my house who are you my name is david balfour i replled david balfour he repeated and looked closely at me come inside mr balfour and we ll talk in mr rankeillor s comfortable sitting room i told him the story of my early life and explained that my uncle had paid captain hoseason to kidnap me and take me to sea the lawyer listened carefully i heard that hoseason s ship went down near the island of mull two months ago he said what have you been doing since then i can easily tell you sir i replied but if i tell you a friend s life may be in danger promise me that you will not get him into trouble or tell the soldiers about him although he looked a little worried at first he promised and i told him the rest of my adventures while i talked his eyes were closed and he seemed to be asleep but i discovered soon afterwards that he had understood and remennbered everything whem o spoke the name of alan breck he opened his eyes and sat up don t use unnecessary names mr balfour he said a lawyer has to be very careful when discussing high landers i don t think i heard your friend s name very well let s call himmr thomson of course i thought all over scotland people are talk ing about alan now that he s accused of the murder of colin campbell i was sure that rankeillor had recognized his name but i just smiled and continued my story using the name of mr thomson instead of alan breck well well said the lawyer when i had finished what an exciting adventure you will have to write it down one day i had heard of you mr david from your friends in essendean who wrote to me when they had no word from you your uncle then told me that he had given you money to study in europe but i did not think that was true i m afraid we all know that ebenezer balfour is not a very good or honest man then captain hoseason appeared saying that you were lost when his ship went down but now i understand what really happened and i know that you are david balfour he put a hand on my shoulder in a fatherly way and continued you ll want to know about the house of shaws it s a strange story when they were young your father alexander and his younger brother ebenezer loved the same girl your father was always a kind loving brother so when the girl decided to marry him alexander left cramond and let ebenezer have the house and farmland well i think it was a bad mistake what happened was that your parents were always very poor and ebenezer became more and more interested in money he never married of course well sir i said and now what will happen now that your father is dead replied the lawyer you own the house of shaws and the farms around it but ebenezer won t accept that and it will be expensive if he wants us to prove it in court in fact we must stay out of court if possible the kidnapping will be difficult to prove and we don t want people asking questions abut your friend mr thomson no i think that we should leave ebenezer at shaws where he s been for twenty five years and ask him to pay you some money everyyear instead of giving you the house what do you think that sounds excellent to me sir i replied but i think that we could accuse my uncle of kidnapping me it s easier to prove than you think listen and i described my plan to him he was very pleased with it yes mr david very good if we can catch ebenezer like that he can t refuse to give you some of the money that belongs to you he called to his sec retary torrance you must come with us tonight torrance you ll have to listen to the conversation you hear and write it all down and bring the balfour papers with you then he turned to me but if i accept your plan mr david i ll have to meet your friend mr thomson who may be i only say may be a criminal he was silent for a while thinking deeply then went on well let s talk of something different do you know the other day i saw torrance in the street but because i wasn t wearing my glasses i didn t recognize him my own secretary ha ha ha and he laughed happily at himself i smiled politely perhaps he s getting old i thought but later that evening when mr rankeillor torrance and i were walking out of queensferry the lawyer suddenly cried out laughing well how stupid of me i ve forgotten my glasses and i understood why he had told met he story about torrance now he could meet alan a man wanted for murder and if the soldiers asked him later for information he could say that he never saw alan clearly and could not possibly recognize him when we arrived near alan s hiding place i whistled the little highland song when he appeared we explained to him what we wanted him to do and he readily agreed so the four of us continued walking until we reached the house of shaws it was a dark night and there were no lights in the windows my uncle was probably in bed mr rankeillor torrance and i hid below the steps near enough to hear any conversation while alan went straight up to the door and knocked loudly after some time my uncle opened his bedroom window and called down in a frightened voice what do ye want at this time of night who are ye i do not want to give ye my own name replied alan but i ve come to talk to ye about someone called david what cried my uncle and after a moment he said un happily will ye come inside to discuss the matter i will not said alan sharply it s here on this doorstep that we must talk come down and speak to me after ebenezer had thought about it he decided to do what alan wanted it took him a long time to come downstairs and a longer time to unlock the heavr door but at last we saw him in the doorway holding his gun in his shaking hands now said alan ye re intelligent enough to see that i m a highlander i have friends who live near the island of mull well it seems that a ship went down near there and soon afterwards my friends found a lad half dead on the beach your nephew mr balfour since then they ve been taking care of him and now they d like to know mr balfour if ye want him back ye ll have to pay if ye do my friends are very poor i don t want him back said my uncle he wasn t a good lad i won t pay a shilling for him blood s thicker than water sir said alan he s your brother s son but if ye don t want him back will ye pay us to keep him and ye ll have to hurry i m not waiting here all night give me a minute to think will ye cried my uncle in two words sir do ye want us to kill or keep the lad oh sir cried ebenezer don t talk of killing well killing s easier and quicker and cheaper i m an honest man said my uncle and no murderer well well replied alan and now how much will ye pay for us to keep him first i need to know how much ye paid hoseason to kidnap the lad how much was it hoseason kidnap what are ye talking about man screamed my uncle jumping up and down on the doorstep hoseason himself has told me about it said alan calmly so ye needn t pretend just answer the question or ye ll find my sword in your stomach don t get angry cried my uncle i gave him twenty pounds that s all but to be honest with ye he was going to sell the lad as a slave and keep that money ye see thankyou mr thomson that s excellent saidthe lawyer stepping forward good evening mr balfour he said politely to the old man and good evening uncle ebenezer said i and it s a grand evening mr balfour added torrance my uncle said nothing but stood there on the doorstep with his mouth open we took him into the kitchen and sat down to discuss matters after an hour it was all decided my uncle accepted that shaws belonged to me but he would stay there during his lifetime he agreed to pay me money every year and mr rankeillor would check that he did we all stayed that night at the house of shaws but while alan and torrance and mr rankeillor slept on the hard beds upstairs i lay down on the kitchen chests which now belonged to me i who had slept out on the hills for so many days and nights was now the owner of a large house and several farms my head was full of exciting plans and ideas and i found it difficult to sleep the next day while mr rankeillor and i were having breakfast together i talked to him about alan mr thomson is still in danger said the lawyer he must leave the country as soon as possible and stay with his friends in france for a while i ll give you money to buy him a place on a ship he ll have to stay hidden until then and his clansman james stewart who s in prison i asked i know he didn t kill colin campbell i saw the mur derer i must speak for james stewart in court my dear boy said rankeillor it s dangerous for anyone to speak for a stewart in campbell court but you must do what you think is right i ll write you a letter to a good lawyer who will be able to help mr thomson s clansman he stood up well i think that we ve finished our business here i must leave now and go back to my work come and see me often mr david goodbye alan and i started walking towards edlnburgh while mr rankeillor and torrance turned back to queensferry we talked about what would happen next alan was going to hide in the countryside near edinburgh until it was safe for him to take a ship to france when i had found him a place i would send him a message then i planned to go back to the high lands to help james stewart return to his family alan and i walked slowly we were both thinking that soon we would have to leave each other and we had been through so much together we stopped when we came to the top of the corstorphine hill and looked down at edinburgh we knew that this was the moment to say goodbye but we stood there silently for a while well goodbye said alan and held out his hand goodbye i said and took his hand then i went off down hill i did not look back at him but i felt very miserable and wanted to sit down and cry like a baby edinburgh was full of noise and traffic and people but i did not notice any of that all the time i was thinking of alan on the hill and there was an ice cold feeling inside me in the months that followed i kept alan s silver button safe and often looked at it remembering our escape through the heather in the wild highlands i felt proud to call alan breck stewart my friend and wondered if i would ever see him again when i returned to the highlands to help his clansman james i found that my adventures with the stewarts were far from finished but that is another story txtba www txtba com saki saki saki sredni vashtar conradin was ten years old and was often ill the boy is not strong said the doctor he will not live much longer but the doctor did not know about conradin s imagination in conradin s lonely loveless world his imagination was the only thing that kept him alive conradin s parents were dead and he lived with his aunt the aunt did not like conradin and was often unkind to him conradin hated her with all his heart but he obeyed her quietly and took his medicine without arguing mostly he kept out of her way she had no place in his world his real everyday life in his aunt s colourless comfortless house was narrow and uninteresting but inside his small dark head exciting and violent thoughts ran wild in the bright world of his imagination conradin was strong and brave it was a wonderful world and the aunt was locked out of it the garden was no fun there was nothing interesting to do he was forbidden to pick the flowers he was forbidden to eat the fruit he was forbidden to play on the grass but behind some trees in a forgotten corner of the garden there was an old shed nobody used the shed and conradin took it for his own to him it became something between a playroom and a church he filled it with ghosts and animals from his imagination but there were also two living things in the shed in one corner lived an old untidy looking chicken conradin had no people to love and this chicken was the boy s dearest friend and in a dark secret place at the back of the shed was a large wooden box with bars across the front this was the home of a very large ferret with long dangerous teeth and claws conradin had bought the ferret and its box from a friendly boy who lived in the village it had cost him all his money but conradin did not mind he was most terribly afraid of the ferret but he loved it with all his heart it was his wonderful terrible secret he gave the ferret a strange and beautiful name and it became his god the aunt went to church every sunday she took conradin with her but to conradin her church and her god were without meaning they seemed grey and uninteresting the true god lived in the shed and his name was sredni vashtar every thursday in the cool silent darkness of the shed conradin took presents to his god he took flowers in summer and fruits in autumn and he made strange and wonderful songs for his god sometimes on days when something important happened conradin took special presents he stole salt from the kitchen and placed it carefully and lovingly in front of the ferret s box one day the aunt had the most terrible toothache it con tinued for three days morning and evening conradin put salt in front of his god in the end he almost believed that sredni vashtar himself had sent the toothache after a time the aunt noticed conradin s visits to the shed it s not good for him to play out there in the cold she said she could always find a reason to stop conradin enjoying himself the next morning at breakfast she told conradin that she had sold the chicken she looked at conradin s white face and waited for him to cry or to be angry but conradin said nothing there was nothing to say perhaps the aunt felt sorry that afternoon there was hot buttered toast for tea toast was usually forbidden conradin loved it but the aunt said that it was bad for him also it made extra work for the cook conradin looked at the toast and quietly took a piece of bread and butter i thought you liked toast the aunt said crossly sometimes said conradin in the shed that evening conradin looked sadly at the empty corner where his chicken had lived and for the first time he asked his ferret god to do something for him do one thing for me sredni vashtar he said softly he did not say what he wanted sredni vashtar was a god after all there is no need to explain things to gods then with a last look at the empty corner conradin returned to the world that he hated and every night in the shed and in his bedroom con radin repeated again and again do one thing for me sredni vashtar so conradin s visits to the shed continued the aunt no ticed and went to look in the shed again what are you keeping in that locked box she asked i m sure you re keeping an animal there it s not good for you conradin said nothing the aunt searched his bedroom until she found the key to the box she marched down to the shed it was a cold afternoon and conradin was forbidden to go outside from the window of the dining room conradin could just see the door of the shed he stood and waited he saw the aunt open the shed door she went inside now thought conradin she has found the box she is opening the door and feeling about inside the box where my god lives do one thing for me sredni vashtar said conradin softly but he said it without hope she will win he thought she always wins soon she will come out of the shed and give her orders somebody will come and take my wonderful god away not a god any more just a brown ferret in a box then there will be nothing important in my life the doctor will be right i shall sicken and die she will win she always wins in his pain and misery conradin began to sing the song of his god sredni vashtar went into battle his thoughts were red thoughts and his teeth were white his enemies called for peace but be brought them death sredni vashtar the beautiful suddenly he stopped singing and went nearer to the window the door of the shed was still open slowly very slowly the minutes went by conradin watched the birds on the grass he counted them always with one eye on that open door the unsmiling housekeeper came in with the tea things still sonradin stood and watched and waited hope was growing like a small sick flower in his heart very softly he sang his song again and his hope grew and grew and then he saw a very wonderful thing out of the shed came a long low yellow and brown animal there were red wet stains around its mouth and neck sredni vashtar said conradin softly the ferret god made its way to the bottom of the garden it stopped for a moment then went quietly into the long grass and disappeared for ever tea is ready said the housekeeper where is your aunt she went down to the shed said conradin and while the housekeeper went down to call the aunt conradin took the toasting fork out of the dining room cupboard he sat by the fire and toasted a piece of bread for himself while he was toasting it and putting butter on it conradin listened to the noises beyond the dining room door first there were loud screams that was the housekeeper then there was the cook s answering cry soon there came the sound of several pairs of feet they were carrying something heavy into the house who is going to tell that poor child said the housekeeper well someone will have to answered the cook and while they were arguing conradin made himself another piece of toast the story teller it was a hot airless afternoon the train was slow and the next stop was nearly an hour away the people in the train were hot and tired there were three small children and their aunt and a tall man who was a bachelor the bachelor did not know the little family and he did not want to know them the aunt and the children talked but it was not a real conversation it was more like a battle with a small housefly which will not go away when the aunt spoke to the children she always began with don t when the children spoke to her they always began with why the bachelor said nothing aloud the small boy opened his mouth and closed it again it made an interesting little noise so he did it again open close open close don t do that cyril said the aunt come and look out of the window the boy closed his mouth and sat next to the window he looked out at the green fields and trees why is that man taking those sheep out of that field he asked suddenly perhaps he s taking them to another field where there is more grass said the aunt it was not a very good answer and the boy knew it but there is lots of grass in that field he said the field is full of grass aunt why doesn t the man leave his sheep in that field i suppose the grass in the other field is better answered the aunt why is it better asked cyril at once oh look at those cows cried the aunt there were cows in nearly all the fields along the railway line cyril did not look at the cows he wanted an answer to his question why is the grass in the other field better he said again the bachelor gave them an angry look the aunt saw him he s a hard unkind man she thought he doesn t like children she searched for a suitable answer to cyril s question but could not find one the smaller girl began to say some words from a song on the road to mandalay where the happy children play she began then she stopped she could not remember any more words so she said the first words again quietly but very clearly then she said them again and again and again the bachelor looked angrily at the girl and then at the aunt come here and sit down quietly the aunt said quickly to the children i m going to tell you a story the children moved slowly towards the aunt s seat they already looked bored clearly the aunt was not a famous story teller the story was horribly uninteresting it was about a little girl she was not a beautiful child but she was always very very good everybody loved her because she was good finally she fell into a lake and her friends saved her because she was so good and they loved her so much did they only save her because she was good asked the bigger girl shouldn t we save bad people too if they fall in to a lake the bachelor wanted to ask the same question but he said nothing well yes we should said the aunt but i m sure the little girl s friends ran specially fast because they loved her so much that was the stupidest story that i ve ever heard said the bigger girl i didn t listen after the first few words said cyril because it was so stupid the smaller girl was already quietly repeating the words of her song for the twentieth time you re not very successful as a story teller the bachelor said suddenly from his corner the aunt looked at him in angry surprise it s not easy to tell stories that children can understand she answered coldly i don t agree with you said the bachelor perhaps you would like to tell them a story said the aunt she gave him a cold little smile yestell us a story said the bigger girl a long time ago began the bachelor there was a little girl called bertha who was extraordinarily good she always worked well at school she always obeyed her teachers and her parents she was never late never dirty and always ate all her vegetables she was polite she was tidy and she never never told lies oh said the children they were beginning to look bored already was she pretty asked the smaller girl no said the bachelor she wasn t pretty but she was horribly good horribly good i like that said cyril the children began to look more interested the words horrible and good together was a new idea for them and it pleased them bertha was always good continued the bachelor because she was so good bertha had three medals there was the never late medal there was the politeness medal and there was the medal for the best child in the world they were very large medals bertha always wore them on her dress and they clinked as she walked along she was the only child in her town who had three medals so everybody knew that she must be an extra good child horribly good repeated cyril happily everybody talked about bertha s goodness the king of that country heard about her and he was very pleased because bertha is so good he said she may come and walk in my palace gardens every friday afternoon the king s gardens were famous they were large and very beautiful and children were usually forbidden to go in them were there any sheep in the palace gardens asked cyril no said the bachelor there were no sheep why weren t there any sheep asked cyril at once the aunt gave a little smile and waited with interest for the bachelor s answer there were no sheep in the king s gardens explained the bachelor because the king s mother had once had a dream in her dream a voice said to her your son will be killed by a sheep or by a clock falling on him thst is why the king never kept a sheep in his gardens or a clock in his palace the aunt thought secretly that this was a very clever answer but she stayed silent was the king killed by a sheep or by a clock asked the bigger girl he is still alive said the bachelor calmly so we don t know if the dream was true or not but although there were no sheep there were lots of little pigs running around everywhere what colour were the pigs asked the smaller glrl black with white faces white with black faces all balck grey and white and some were all white the bachelor stopped for a moment while the children s imaginations took in these wonderful pictures then he went on again bertha was sorry that there were no flowers in the palace gardens she had promised her aunts that she would not pick any of the kind king s flowers she wanted very much to be good and to keep her promise so she was very cross when she found that there were no flowers to pick why weren t there any flowers because the pigs had eaten them all said the bachelor immediately the gardeners had told the king that he couldn t have pigs and flowers because pigs eat flowers so the king decided to have pigs and no flowers the children thought that this was an excellent idea most people choose flowers said cyril he looked very pleased but of course pigs are much better than flowers there were lots of other wonderful things in the palace gardens the bachelor continued there were lakes with gold and blue and green fish in them there were trees with beautiful birds that could talk and say clever things there were also birds that could sing popular songs well on the first friday afternoon in may bertha came to the king s gardens the king s soldiers saw her beautiful white dress and her three medals for goodness and they opened the doors to the gardens at once bertha walked up and down and enjoyed herself very much as she walked along the three medals on her beautiful white dress clinked against each other she heard them clinking and she thought i m here in these lovely gardens because i am the best child in the world she felt pleased and happy and very very good just then a very big hungry wolf came into the gardens it wanted to catch a fat little pig for its supper what colour was the wolf asked the children who were listening to the story with great interest he was grey said the bachelor with a black tongue and angrg yellow eges he had long black claws and big strong yellowish teeth the wolf was hungry he smelled the ground with his long grey nose then he saw bertha s beautiful clean white dress and began to move quietly towards her bertha saw the wolf and she wished she had not come to the gardens oh why did i come here she thought all the bad children are safe at home i wish i wasn t an extraordinarily good child then i could be safe at home too she ran as hard as she could and the wolf came after her on his long grey legs at last bertha mannged to reach some big sweet smelling myrtle bushes and she hid herself in the thickest bush the wolf walked round and round the bushes with his angry yellow eyes and his long blach tongue but he couldn t see bertha because the bushes were too thick and he couldn t smell her because the smell of the myrtle was too strong so after a while the wolf became bored and decided to go and catch a little pig for his supper bertha was terribly frightened her heart beat very fast and her body shook with fear her arms shook and her legs shook her three medals for goodness shook too and as they shook they clinked together the wolf was just moving away when he heard the medals clinking and he stopped to listen the medals clinked again the wolf s yellow eyes shone and he ran into the myrtle bushes pulled bertha out and ate her he ate everything except her shoes a few small pieces of her dress and the three medals for goodness were any of the little pigs killed asked cyril no they all escaped the story began badly said the smaller girl but it finished beautifully it is the most beautiful story that i have ever heard said the bigger girl it is the only beautiful story i have ever heard said cyril the aunt did not agree it was a most improper story she said angrily you mustn t tell children stories like that you have destroyed years of careful teaching well said the bachelor he put on his coat and picked up his bags the children sat still and were quiet for ten minutes while they listened to the story and they didn t do that for you i feel sorry for that woman thought the bachelor as he stepped down from the train at the next station what will people think when those children ask her for an improper story gabriel ernest cunningham had spent an agreeable week in the country with his friend van cheele now van cheele was driving his guest back to the station cunningham was unusually quiet on the journey but van cheele talked all the time so he did not notice his friend s silence suddenly cunningham spoke there is a wild animal in your woods he said a wild animal a few rabbits perhaps nothing very terrible surely said van cheele cunningham said nothing what did you mean about a wild animal asked van cheele later at the station nothing it was my imagination here is the train said cunningham that afternoon van cheele went for a walk through his woods he knew a little about plants and animals and he enjoyed walking through the woods around his house and looking at the birds and flowers there he also enjoyed telling everyone about them aftefwards of course he never saw anything very surprising until that afternoon during his walk van cheele came to a deep pool under some tall trees he knew it well after all it was his pool but today he saw a boy of about sixteen lying on a large rock beside the pool the boy was drying his wet naked brown body in the sun his hair was wet too and he had long golden wolfish eyes he turned those eyes towards van cheele with a look of lazy watchfulness van cheele was surprised to see the boy where does this wild looking boy come from he thought can he be the miller s son he disappeared two months ago people say he fell into the river it s a fast running river and nobody ever found his body i wonder but the miller s boy was only a young child what are you doing here asked van cheele enjoying the sunshine of course said the boy where do you live here in these woods you can t live in these woods said van cheele they are very nice woods said the boy politely but where do you sleep at night i don t sleep at night that s my busiest time van cheele began to feel cross what did the boy mean what do you eat he asked meat said the boy he opened his mouth showing very white teeth meat what kind of meat well if you must know i eat rabbits wild birds chickens from the farm and young sheep from the hills i like children when i can find them but they re usually too well locked in at night it s two months since i tasted child meat the boy is joking about the children thought van cheele but perhaps he really is stealing animals from the woods and farms i must find out more about this aloud he said you catch rabbits you must be joking our rabbits are much too fast for you at night i hunt on four feet was the boy s surprising replp you mean that you hunt with a dog guessed van cheele the boy sat up suddenly and laughed a strange low laugh to van cheele that laugh sounded horrlbly like a growl i don t think any dog would like to hunt with me the boy said not at night there is something horrible about this boy thought van cheele i don t like the way he looks and i don t like the way he talks i can t let you stay in my woods he said aloud very well thenshall i come and live in your house replied te boy van cheele thought about his quiet tidy house no he did not want this strange wild boy at all of course the boy was joking but van cheele was not amused if you don t go away he said i shall have to call the police at once the boy turned and jumped head first into the pool a moment later his shining wet body landed half way up the grassy bank where van cheele was standing van cheele stepped backwards his foot slipped on the wet grass and he fell he found himself lying on the grass with those wolfish yellow eyes uncomfortably near to his he felt a moment of horrible fear the boy laughed again a laugh that was like the growl of a wild animal then disaggeared among the bushes what an extraordinarily wild animal said van cheele as he picked himself up and then he remembered cunning ham s words about a wild animal in his woods as he walked slowly home van cheele thought about several things which had happened in and around the village recently perhaps this boy knows something about them he thought something has been killing rabbits and birds in the woods lately something has been stealing the farmer s chickens and carrying off the young sheep from the hills is it possible that this wild boy is hunting at night with a fast intelligent dog the boy talked of hunting on four feet at night but he also said that dogs did not like to hunt with him at night very strange indeed as van cheele walked along he turned the questions over and over in his head suddenly he stopped the miller s son he said to himself the child disappeared two months ago everyone thought that he had fallen into the river and been carried away but the child s mother did not believe this she said she had heard a scream and the scream came from the hill a long way away from the water it s impossible of course said van cheele to himself but the child disappeared two months ago and the boy talked about child meat he was joking of course but what a horrible joke van cheele usually talked to his aunt about the birds plants and animals he saw on his walks but today he said nothing he was an important man in his village if there was a thief living in his woods he did not want anyone to know if people hear about the boy he thought perhaps they will want me to pay for their lost chickens and their disappearing sheep he was unusually quiet at dinner what s the matter with you joked his aunt did you see a wolf on your walk at breakfast the next morning van cheele realized that he still felt uncomfortable about yesterday s adventure i know what i do he said to himself i take the train to london and i go and see cunningham i ask him if he was joking when he said there was a wild animal in my woods after he had decided this van cheele felt better he sang a happy little song as he walked to the sitting room for his morning cigarette his fat old dog walked beside him as van cheele entered the sitting room the song died on his lips and his dog ran away with his tail between his legs there on the day bed with his hands comfortably behind his head lay the boy from the woods he was drier than yesterday but he was still naked what are you doing here asked van cheele angrily you told me i couldn t stay in the woods said the boy calmly but i didn t tell you to come here what if my aunt sees you what will she think van cheele hurriedly covered his unwanted guest s nakedness with a newspaper at that moment his aunt entered the room this is a poor boy explained van cheele quickly he has lost his way and lost his memory too he doesn t know who he is or where he comes from miss van cheele was very interested perhaps his name is on his underclothes she said he has lost his underclothes too said van cheele the newspaper was slipping off the boy s naked body van cheele hurried to replace it miss van cheele was a kind old lady she felt sorry for this naked helpless child we must help him she said she sent the housekeeper to a neighbour s house to borrow some clothes soon the boy was clean and tidy and dressed in shirt trousers and shoes van cheele thought he looked just as strange and wolfish as before but miss van chee e thought he was sweet we must give him a name until we know who he really is she said gabriel ernest i think those are nice suitable names van cheele agreed but he was not sure that the boy was a nice suitable boy van cheele s old dog when he saw the boy had run away in fear and would not come back into the house van cheele decided to go and see cunningham at once as he got ready to go to the station his aunt was busily arranging a children s tea party in the church hall gabriel ernest will help me with the little ones she said happily when van cheele got to london cunningham did not want to talk at first you ll think i m crazy he said but what did you see asked van cheele i saw something something unbelievable on the last evening of my visit to you i was standing half hidden in the bushes watching the sun go down suddenly i noticed a naked boy he has been swimming in a pool somewhere i said to myself he was standing on the hillside and he too was watching the sun go down then the sun disappeared behind the hill and its light was gone at the same moment a very surprising thing happened the boy disappeared too what he disappeared just like that said van cheele excitedly no it was much more horrible than that on the open hillside where the boy had been i saw a large blackish grey wolf with long white teeth and yellow eyes you ll think i m crazy but van cheele did not wait he was running towards the station as fast as he could he did not know what he could do i can t send my aunt a message he thought what can i say gabriel ernest is a werewolf my aunt will think i m joking i must get home before sundown he caught his train with painful slowness it carried him to the station a few miles from his home he took a taxi to his village take me to the church halland hurry he ordered the taxi drove along the quiet country roads and the sky turned pink and purple as the sun got lower and lower in the west his aunt was putting away some uneaten cakes and sand wiches when he arrived where is gabriel ernest screamed van cheele he s taking little jack toop home said his aunt calmly it was getting so late i didn t want to send the dear little boy home alone isn t the sky beautiful this evening but van cheele had no time to talk about the beautiful sky he ran like the wind down the narrow road that went to the toops house on one side was the fast running river on the other was the dark hillside in a minute i ll catch up with them van cheele thought then the sun went down behind the hill and the whole world became grey and cold van cheele heard a short scream of fear and he knew he was too late nobody ever saw litele jack toop or gabrid ernest again gabriel ernest s clothes were found lying in the road poor littler jack fell into the river said miss van cheele and dear gabriel ernest took off his clothes and jumped into the river to try to save him mrs toop had eleven other children and did not cry too long for her lost son but miss van cheele was terribly sad about gabriel ernest he must have a memorial in the church she said she chose the words herself gabriel ernest an unknown boy who bravely gave his life for another van cheele usually did what his aunt wanted but he refused to give any money at all for gabriel ernest s memorial tobermory i t was a cold rain washed afternoon in late august lady blemley and her guests were sitting round the teatable everyone was listening open mouthed to mr cornelius appin although he was one of her guests lady blemley did notknow mr appin well she had invited him to stay at blemley house because she had heard that he was clever but until teatime that day he had not done or said anything clever hedid not play tennis or sing or make intelligent conversation but now mr appin was describing a most extraordinary discovery and the other guests were listening with deep interest are you telling us that you have found a way of teachinganimals to talk sir wilfrid was saying and our dear oldtobermory is your first successful student i have studied this problem for seventeen years saidmr appin but i didn t have any real success until eight ornine months ago of course i have studied thousands of animals but recently i have worked only with cats a cat of course is a wild animal who agrees to live with you all catsare intelligent but naturally some cats are more intelligent than others when i met tobermory a week ago i realized at once that here was an extraordinarily intelligent cat a veryspecial cat indeed in tobermory i found the student i needed with him i have succeeded in my plan nobody laughed and nobody actually said rubbish al though clovis s lips moved silently and have you really taught tobermory asked missresker to say and understand short easy words my dear miss resker said mr appin patiently weteach little children and very slow stupid adults in that way but tobermory is a most intelligent cat he can speak englishas well as you or i can this time clovis said rubbish aloud sir wilfrid was more polite but it was clear that he didnot believe mr appin s story shall we bring the cat in here and hear him forourselves said lady blemley sir wilfrid went off to look for tobermory mr appin will try to be clever said miss resker happily but if we watch him carefully we shall see his lips move in a minute sir wiflrid returned looking very excited it s true you know he said i found tobermory sleeping in the smoking room and called out to him to come for his tea he lifted his head and opened one eye i said come on toby don t keep us waiting and he said calmly i ll come when i m ready i couldn t believe my ears the guests all started talking at once while mr appin satsilently and looked very pleased with himself indeed then tobermory entered the room and calmly walkedover to the tea table the conversation stopped nobody knewwhat to say to a talking cat at last lady blemley spoke would you like some milk tobermory she asked in ahigh unnatural voice i don t mind if i do answered tobermory lady blemley s hand shook with excitement and some of the milkwent onto the carpet oh dear i m so sorry she said i don t mind it isn t my carpet after all replied to bermory there was another silence then miss resker asked politely did you find it difficult to learn english tobermory tobermory looked straight through her with his brightgreen eyes clearly he did not answer questions that did notinterest him what do you think of the intelligence of people askedmavis pellington which people s intelligence asked tobermory coldly well my intelligence for example said mavis with alittle laugh you make things very uncomfortable for me said tobermory although he did not look at all uncomfortable whenlady blemley wanted to invite you here sir wilfrid was notpleased mavis pellington is the stupidest woman i know he said that s why i want to invite

morning that your car would be just right for me major barfield did his best to help he tried to start anew conversation how are you getting on with your littleblack and white lady friend in the garden he asked tobermory everybody realized at once that this was a mistake tobermory gave him an icy look we do not usually discuss these things in polite company he said but i havewatched you a little since you have been in this house i thinkperhaps you would not like me to discuss your lady friends the major s face became very red and all the otherguests began to look worried and uncomfortable what was tobermory going to say next would you like to go down to the kitchen now tobermory asked lady blemley politely and see if the cook hasgot your dinner ready no thank you said tobermory i ve only just hadmy tea i don t want to make myself sick cats have nine lives you know said sir wilfrid with alaugh possibly answered tobermory but only one stomach lady blemley cried mrs cornett don t send thatcat to the kitchen he will talk about us to the cook everyone was very worried now they remembered uncomfortably that tobermory moved freely all over the houseand gardens at all hours of the day and night he could lookinto any of the bedrooms if he wanted to what had he seen what had he heard nobody s secrets were safe now oh why did i come here cried agnes resker whocould never stay silent for long you know very well why you came here said tobermory immediately you came for the food of course i heardyou talking to mrs cornett in the garden you said that the blemleys were terribly boring people but they had an excel lent cook you mustn t believe him cried agnes i never saidthat did i mrs cornett later mrs cornett repeated your words to bertie vantahn said tobermory she said that resker woman willgo anywhere for four good meals a day and bertie said just then tobermory looked out of the window and sawthe doctor s big yellow cat crossing the garden immediatelyhe disappeared through the open window everyone started talking at once and mr appin foundhimself in a storm of angry questions you must stop this at once everyone said to him what will happen if tobermory teaches other cats to talk we shall never have a moment s peace it s possible that he has taught the gardener s cat replied mr appin thoughtfully but i don t believe he hashad time to teach any other cats then said mrs cornett although tobermory is avaluable cat he and the gardener s cat must die don t youagree lady blemley you re right said lady blemley sadly my husbandand i love tobermory well we did before this afternoon but now of course he must die as soon as possible we will poison his dinner said sir wilfrid and i willkill the gardener s cat myself the gardener won t like it but i ll say it has some kind of disease but what about my discovery cried mr appin what about all my years of work are you going to destroy my onlysuccessful student you can go and teach the cows on the farm said mrs cornett coldly or the elephants at the zoo elephants arevery intelligent they tell me and elephants don t hide behind chairs or under beds and listen to people s conversations mr appin knew when he was beaten dinner that evening was not a success sir wilfrid hadhad a difficult time with the gardener s cat and later with the gardener agnes resker refused to eat anything while mavis pellington ate her meal in silence everyone was waiting for tobermory a plate of poisoned fish stood ready for him in thedining room but he did not come home nobody talked much and nobody laughed it was a most uncomfortable meal after dinner the blemleys and their guests sat in the smoking room everyone was quiet and worried and nobodywanted to play cards at eleven o clock the cook and the housekeeper went to bed they left the kitchen window openfor tobermory as usual but he did not come at two o clock clovis spoke he won t come home tonight he s probably in the newspaper office selling them his story they ll love it the story will be the excitement of the year after that everyone went to bed but nobody slept in the morning tobermory had still not come home breakfast was another quiet uncomfortable meal then half way through the coffee the gardener brought in tobermory s blood stained body look at his claws cried clovis he s been fighting and there on tobermory s claws was the yellow hair of the doctor s cat by lunchtime most of the guests had left blemley house lady blemley began to feel better she took out her pen and paper and wrote a very angry letter to the doctor about the death of her valuable cat tobermory was mr appin s only successful student afew weeks after tobermory s death an elephant escaped from the dresden zoo and killed an english visitor the zoo keeper said that the elephant had always been acalm and gentle animal before but suddenly it seemed to be come very angry with the english visitor who was talking toit the dead man s name was reported in the newspapers as oppin but his first name was cornelius if appin was trying to teach the poor elephant to speak german said clovis i m not surprised it killed him the she wolf to leonard bilsiter the real world was not very agreeableor interesting he preferred to live in an unseen world of his imagination children are often very good atthis but they are happy in their own dream worlds and do nottry to make other people believe them leonard bilsiter talked about the unseen world to anyone who would listen to him nothing very strange happened to leonard until one year he travelled by train across eastern europe he had a long conversation with a russian passenger who talked about mag ic and hidden powers in a most interesting way leonard lis tened excitedly he came home with many stories about the strange dark mysteries which he called siberian magic his aunt cecilia hoops was deeply interested in leonard s siberian magic when she told her friends about it my dears he took a garden vegetable and changed it into abird in front of my eyes her friends realized that she also had a wonderful imagination leonard together with his hidden powers was invited tomary hampton s house party several other people were alsostaying in the house and they all had to listen to leonardtalking about the mysteries of the unseen world do please change me into a wolf mr

your zoo at pabham park a quiet friendly she wolf there s louisa said lord pabham thoughtfully she s very quiet and gentle why do you ask i d like to borrow her tomorrow evening said clovis lightly may i please tomorrow night repeated lord pabham in surprise yes wolves usually sleep during the day don t they so a night time journey won t hurt her could you ask one of your men to bring louisa here when it is dark then he can take her quietly into the conservatory at the same time as mrshampton leaves the dining room lord pabham looked at clovis in surprise then he smiled i understand he said you re going to try a little siberian magic and has mrs hampton agreed to help you mary has promised if your she wolf is quiet and gen tle louisa won t give you any trouble said lord pabham the next day several more guests arrived leonard bil siter enjoyed telling them all about siberian magic and hidden powers he talked all through dinner when the coffee arrivedat the end of the meal leonard s aunt spoke dear leonard she said please show us your powers change something into another shape she turned to the oth er guests he can do it if he wants to she told them oh please show us said mavis pellington excitedly well began leonard if somebody will give me asmall coin oh surely you aren t going to do stupid things withdisappearing coins said clovis we want to see somethingreally surprising that s right said mary hampton why don t youchange me into a wolf you promised she got up from thetable and walked into the conservatory with a bowl of fruit forher macaws i have already warned you said leonard seriously itis dangerous to joke about these things i don t believe you can do it laughed mary from theconservatory as she spoke she disappeared behind a largegreen plant mrs hampton began leonard seriously then anicy wind seemed to fill the dining room and at the same timemrs hampton s macaws began to scream what s wrong with those stupid birds mary askedher husband just then a big grey wolf stepped out from be hind the large green plant leonard s aunt saw it first leonard she screamed bring mrs hampton back at once we don t want a danger ous wild animal in here i i don t know how to bring her back said leonardin a small frightened voice rubbish shouted mr hampton you changed my dear wife into a wolf now you must bring her back again please believe me said leonard i didn t change your wife into a wolf then where is she and how did that animal get into the conservatory asked mr hampton angrily of course we must believe you when you say that you didn t change mrs hampton into a wolf said clovis politely but you must agree that it all looks very strange how can you stand there arguing cried mavis pelling ton with a wild animal in the house lord pabham began mr hampton you know a lotabout wild animals i buy all my animals said lord pabham i have nev er found one in a conservatory before but this is a wolf i amsure of that i think it s probably a north american she wolf oh who cares where it came from screamed mavis as the wolf came a few steps further into the room can t you offer it some food and take it away safely somewhere be fore it bites somebody if this animal is really mrs hampton said clovis she s just had an excellent dinner she won t be interested infood oh leonard cried his aunt can t you use your wonderful powers to change this terrible animal into something small and gentle like a rabbit i don t think mr hampton would like that said clovis you re right shouted mr hampton i forbid it all my wolves love sugar said lord pabham if youlike i ll offer this one a piece he took a piece of sugar fromthe table and pushed it along the floor towards louisa she ateit quickly and then clearly hoping for more sugar she fol lowed lord pabham out of the room the guests left the table thankfully and hurried into the conservatory it was empty mrs hampton had disappeared the door to the garden is locked on the inside saidclovis he had quickly turned the key while he was pretend ing to try the lock everyone turned towards leonard bilsiter if you have not changed my wife into a wolf said mrhampton will you please explain where she has gone clear ly she could not go out through a locked door so where isshe i tell you i had nothing to do with it repeatedleonard again and again but nobody believed him i m leaving said mavis pellington i refuse to stayanother hour in this house just then mary hampton entered the room what happened she asked crossly someone has beenplaying a stupid game with me i found myself in the kitchen eating sugar from lord pabham s hand i hate stupid games and my doctor has forbidden me to eat sugar well my dear began mr hampton mrs hamptonlistened excitedly as he explained so you really did change me into a wolf mr bilsiter cried mrs hampton no no said leonard it s all a mistake actually i did it said clovis you see i spent two years in russia and i know a little about siberian magic of course i don t like to talk about it but when other people talk a lot of rubbish about hidden powers i like to show what siberian magic can really do may i please have a drink ifeel a little tired now leonard bilsiter looked at clovis with hate in his eyes at that moment he wished strongly that he could change clovisin to some small helpless animal and then step on him very hard haworth there was a cold wind this afternoon but the sun shone for an hour or two i walked out on the moors behind the house the sheep were hiding from the wind under the stone walls and there were grey clouds over the hills to the west it is only november but i could smell snow in the air it will be a cold winter this year of the rector of the village of haworth haworth is a village of small grey stone houses on the side of a hill in the north of england and i live in a house at the top of the hill next to the church and the graveyard i walked through the graveyard to the church this afternoon all my family except anne are buried there the wind had blown some dead leaves through the door into the church and i watched them dancing in the sunlight near the grave soon i shall be in that grave with my wife and children under the cold grey stone and dancing leaves it is dark outside now and it is very quiet in this house charlotte s husband mr nicholls is reading in his room and our servant is cooking in the kitchen only the three of us live here now it is very quiet i can hear the sounds of the wood burning in the fire and the big clock on the stairs there is another sound too the sound of the wind outside the wind has many voices it sings and laughs and shouts to itself all night long last night it cried like a little child and i got out of bed and went to the window to listen there was no child of course only the wind and the grave stones cold in the pale moonlight but i decided then that iwould write the story of my children today before it is too late charlotte s friend mrs gaskell is writing a book about her and perhaps she will want to read my story it is a fine story it began in april when we came to haworth for the first time there was a strong wind blowing that day too out of a dark cloudy sky we could see snow on the moors the road to haworth goes up a hill and there was ice on the stones of the road maria my wife was afraid to ride up the hill in the carts we ll walk children she said if one of those horses falls down there ll be a terrible accident come on let s go and see our new house she was a small woman my wife and not very strong but she carried the baby anne up the hill in her arms i carried emily she was one and a half years old then the others walked my two year old son patrick branwell walked with me and charlotte who was nearly four walked with her mother the two oldest children elizabeth and maria ran on in front they were very excited and laughed and talked all the way the people of haworth came out to watch us some of them helped but most of them just stood in their doorways and watched they are very poor people in this village i was their new rector we had seven carts to carry our furniture up that icy hill but it was hard work for the horses when we reached our house the wind was blowing had in our faces my wife hur ried inside and began to light fires do you like it my dear i asked her that night when the children were in bed she looked pale and tired i thought it was because of the long journey and the children perhaps it was she held out her hands to the fire and said of course patrick it s a fine house i do hope it will be a good home for you and the children i was a little surprised by that and for you maria i said don t forget yourself you are the most important per son in the world to me she smiled then a lovely smile thank you patrick she said she was a very small woman and she was often tired because of the children but when she smiled at me like that i thought she was the most beautiful woman in england a year and a half later she was dead she did not die quickly she was in bed for seven long months in awful pain the doctor came often and her sister elizabeth came too to help the children were ill as well it was a terrible time my wife maria died in september she was thirty eight it was my job to bury her in the church our six young children stood and watched quietly afterwards we went back to the house i called them into this room and spoke to them i said you must not cry too much my dears your mother is with god now she is happy one day you will all die and if you are good you will go to god too but why maria asked why did she die now father we need her this world is a hard place children and we cannot under stand everything that god does but god loves us never forget that your mother loved you and perhaps she can see you now we must all try to work hard learn as much as possible and be kind to each other will you do that yes father they all looked so sad i remember and they listened so carefully little emily said who will be our mother now maria is the oldest so she will help me you must all listen to her and do what she says and your aunt elizabeth is here too perhaps she will stay for a while elizabeth did stay she was older than my wife and she wasn t married we called her aunt branwell she came from penzance in cornwall a warm sunny place by the sea in the south west of england it is often cold on the moors behind haworth and the winds blow all winter aunt branwell hated haworth but she stayed here all her life to help me with her sister s children she was a good kind woman i was very proud of my little maria she was only eight years old but she worked all day like an adult she helped the little ones to get washed and dressed she helped them to play and draw and read she was like a little mother to them she could read very well herself we always had books and newspapers in the house and i talked to the children about them every day i talked to them about adult things the duke of wellington and the important things that he was doing in london the children listened carefully and tried hard to un derstand maria often read to the others from the newspaper and asked me questions about it she understood it better than most men i was sure my children were very clever but i did not have time to talk to them all day i had my work to do so in i sent them to school cowan bridge school i was born in a small house in ireland there were only two rooms in our house and i had nine brothers and sisters my parents were very poor we had no money and only a small farm but we did have a church near us and that church had a school that school gave me my one chance of success i worked very hard there and when i was sixteen i became a teacher then i went to st john s college cambridge to study some more i became a curate when i married i was able to get a good job and a house for my family i got all that because i worked so hard at school i wanted my children to go to the best school that i could find cowan bridge school was a school for the daughters of churchmen it belonged to a churchman mr wilson he was a good man i thought i liked the school and it was not too expensive so in july i took maria and elizabeth there in september i took charlotte and in november emily as well emily was just six then and charlotte was eight i remember how quiet the house was that autumn in the evenings i taught my son branwell and my wife s sister looked after the youngest child anne i often thought about the girls my eldest maria was a good clever girl i thought she must be the best pupil in the school i waited for her letters and wondered what new things she was learning she did tell me some things in her letters but not enough she told me she liked the schoolwork and i was pleased but she did not tell me about the food or the cold or the unkind teachers charlotte told me those things much later i know maria did not tell me that the food was often burnt and uneat able or that they could not sleep because the beds were too cold she did not tell me that the poor hungry children had to wash with ice in the morning and walk through wet snow to sit for two hours with icy feet in a cold church on sundays she did not tell me that many of the children at the school were ill you didn t tell me that did you maria did you or did you try to write something and stop because you were afraid of the teachers you were a good brave child and i was so proud of you so pleased because you were at school i wanted you to learn everything i didn t want you to be poor like my sisters god help me i thought you were happy at cowan bridge school there were no christmas holidays at the school and it was too difficult to travel over the cold windy hills to visit my little girls so i sat at home here in haworth with aunt branwell my son and the little girl anne outside the wind blew snow over the gravestones and there was ice on our windows on christmas day little anne looked lonely she asked me about her sisters don t worry my dear i said they are happy with the other girls at school you shall go to cowan bridge too when you are older i remember how strangely she looked at me then she was only four and very pretty she smiled at me but her face went very white and her hands started to shake i don t know why i thought she was cold and i put some more wood on the fire then aunt branwell read her a story from the bible and i for got about it in february a letter came it was in an adult s handwriting not maria many children in the school have been ill and your daughter maria my hand began to shake badly and i dropped the letter on the floor as i picked it up i could see only one word dead if your daughter maria does not come home soon she will be dead i went over the hills to bring her back my maria was in a small bed in a cold room upstairs coughing badly elizabeth and charlotte and emily stood beside her waiting for me they looked so sad and ill and frightened i remember the big eyes in their small white faces but i did not bring them home then the school doctor said it was not necessary so i took maria home across the cold windy moors to haworth i sat be side her in the coach and held her hand all the way i remem ber how cold her hand was in mine thin cold fingers that did not move at all it was too late to save her she lay in bed upstairs for nearly three months but she was too ill to eat her poor face was white i remember and it seemed thin and small like a dead child s only her eyes looked alive big dark eyes in a thin white face don t cry father she said to me once i shall be with mother soon you know and with god i buried maria beside her mother and a month later i buried elizabeth there too she became ill at school and a woman from the school brought her home i brought charlotte and emily home two weeks later they were here when elizabeth died her body lay all night in a wooden box on the table and her little sisters and brother kissed her before she was buried i had wanted so much for these two girls and now i had nothing i stood in the church and looked at the summer flow ers i had put on their grave i remembered how my wife had held the girls in her arms and how she had smiled at me when we looked at them they have come back to you now maria i said i am sorry i am so sorry my love the little books i had four children nowcharlotte branwell emily and anne i did not send them to school again for many years god s ways are hard to understand i thought perhaps god was not pleased with me perhaps he wanted maria and elizabeth for himself i decided to keep the others at home aunt branwell could teach them and i could help when i had time they were clever children quick at learning they loved to write and draw and paint and they talked all day long and thank god they were not ill in the afternoons my servant tabby took them for long walks on the moors behind the house they walked for miles on the hilltops in the strong clean wind alone with the birds and the sheep i think it was good for them they grew stronger and there was a bright light in their eyes i was not the only sad father in haworth many many chil dren died and i had to bury them all the water in haworth was bad so many children died from illness and many more died from accidents i saw a hundred children die from fire in my house i was always very careful i had no curtains no car pets because i was afraid of fire my children never wore cot ton clothes because they burn so easily one day in i brought a box of toy soldiers home from leeds next morning the children began to play games with them this one is mine charlotte said he s the duke of wellington and this is mine said branwell he s napoleon bonaparte the children liked the wooden soldiers and began to tell a story about them it was a very exciting story i remember they read it to me and aunt branwell and tabby our servant the next day they invented another story and then another and then for several days the children were very quiet and i wondered what they were doing i went upstairs and opened their bedroom door inside they were all busily writing or drawing on small pieces of paper the wooden soldiers were in the middle of the room in front of them what are you doing i asked emily looked up oh father please go away she said we re writing our secret books i suppose i looked sad what can t i see them i asked they all thought for a minute then charlotte said very se riously you can see some of them of course papa but they aren t easy to read because it s very small writing we ll show them to you when we are ready these toy soldiers opened a new world for my children they showed me some of their stories but there were hundreds that tney kept secret they all began writing so young charlotte the oldest was only ten and emily was eight i don t think they ever stopped mr nicholls has all charlotte s little books now in a cupboard in his room some of them are no more than five or six centimetres high they are beautifully made and full of small pictures and tiny writing there is one on my desk now but i can t read it my eyes are too bad charlotte and branwell wrote about a country called angria while emily and anne wrote about a land called gondal the paple in those countries fought battles and fell in love and wrote letters and poems my children wrote these poems and letters and they wrote books about angria and gondal they drew maps of the countries wrote newspapers about them and drew pictures of the towns and people in their stories they in vented a new world for themselves they wrote many of these stories when i was in bed i used to read to the family and pray with them in the evening and then i usually went to bed at nine o clock one night i re member i woke up and came down again at ten there was a noise in my room this room where i am writing now i opened the door and saw charlotte and branwell with a candle looking at a picture on my wall what are you doing here i asked we re looking at the picture papa branwell said it s the duke of zamorna and the duke of northangerland fighting in glasstown i looked at the picture it s here now behind me it s a pic ture of a story in the bible with a town mountains and hun dreds of people in it what do you mean i asked it s one of our stories papa charlotte said we have to come in here to look at the picture then we invent what hap pens tell me then i said they both looked very excited their faces were pink and their eyes were bright in the candlelight but they looked happy too i put my candle on the table and sat down here where i am sitting now to listen to their story it was a wonderful story charlotte s wooden soldier the duke of wellington had had a son arthur duke of zamorna branwell s toy soldier bonaparte had become the strong bad good looking duke of northangerland the two dukes were fighting a terrible battle in a city called glasstown there were soldiers who died bravely and beautiful women who fell in love i listened until two o clock in the morning there was much more but i have forgotten it now but i remember the excitement in my children s faces sometimes i thought they could actually see these people as they talked next day they said no more about it and i did not ask it was their own secret world and they did not let me into it again but i was pleased they had told me about it once and sometimes they showed me drawings of places in angria or gondal all my children could draw and paint beautifully charlotte used watercolours and often spent hours painting small pictures branwell used oil paints as well growing up when branwell was fourteen or fifteen he did a lot of oil paintings he painted people in the village and it was easy to recognize the faces in the pictures later he did a fine painting of his three sisters i was very proud of him we all decided he would become a famous artist charlotte went to school again when she was fifteen it was a much better school miss wooler s school at roe head i don t think charlotte liked school but she wanted to be a teacher a governess so she worked hard i taught bran well at home and aunt branwell taught emily and anne the girls and branwell were learning to play the piano and bran well played the music in church emily and anne had dogs and they used to take them for walks on the moors anne s dog was called flossy and emily had a big strong one called keeper keeper went everywhere with her i think emily loved that dog more than any person emily was sometimes a difficult child she was very shy and did not often speak to anyone outside the family when she was older i sent her to school with charlotte but she hated it so i brought her home and sent anne instead branwell was not shy he could talk to anyone for hours everyone in haworth liked him i remember the day in when branwell went to london he was eighteen years old and he was going to the royal academy in london to learn to be an artist he walked down the hill in haworth with a bag of his best paintings on his back and everyone in the village came out to see him go that was a great day for me something terrible happened in london but i don t know what it was branwell came back two weeks later his face white his clothes dirty i don t know where he went or what happened in london he refused to tell me he just sat upstairs alone in his room for hours later i paid for a room in bradford for him to work in he could paint pictures of famous people there i thought it was easy work for him but he couldn t do it he spent all my mon ey and came home again after a while this was a sad time for me my eyes were very bad and i had to pay a young curate to help me with my work for the church my old servant tabby broke her leg and was very ill and then one day i got a letter from miss wooler s school my curate read it to me dear mr bront the letter said i am afraid that your daughter anne is very ill and i don t think i ever moved so fast in all my life six hours later i was at roe head the next day anne and charlotte were home anne was still alive thank god a month later she was well again thank god all my children were safe at home i was happy to have them here they were so clever and kind and they loved each other so much but i was an old man with bad eyes and aunt branwell and i had very little money my children had to find work somewhere in order to live but what sort of work could they do looking for work i do not remember everything they did charlotte and anne worked as governesses for some months teaching rich children in big houses and branwell got a job like that too for a while but they didn t like their work at home my children were full of talk and laughter but away from home they were shy quiet unhappy they wrote a lot of letters in their search for work some times to famous people branwell wanted to be a writer so he wrote to writers but not many of them wrote back he began to look pale and sad in those days and he was often in the vil lage pub drinking and talking to the people there then he got a job selling tickets on the railways and left home the girls had an idea i remember the day when they told me about it charlotte and anne were at home on holiday and we were all in the sitting room after dinner one evening anne was playing the piano and singing quietly to herself she was the prettiest of the three girls i suppose she had long wavy brown hair and a gentle kind face emily sat on the floor be side her stroking the ears of her dog keeper charlotte sat opposite me on the sofa like a little child with a serious thoughtful face she was the smallest her feet were no bigger than my hands she looked at me carefully papa she said we want to start a school really my dear where here but charlotte my dear we have no room this house is full already oh but we could change the house papa we could build a schoolroom well yes i suppose so i said but why do you want to do this isn t it better to work as governesses in some big fine house oh no papa all three girls spoke at once anne had stopped playing and emily looked very angry and frightening i could see they had thought hard about this charlotte said the life of a governess is terrible papa a governess has no time of her own no friends no one to talk to and if she gets angry with the children they just run to their mother i couldn t possibly be a governess all my life it s true papa anne said it s an awful life we re so lonely away from each other why can t we have a school and all live here then we can take care of you and aunt branwell when you get old i looked at emily her eyes were shining i could see that the idea was important to her too but why will people send their children here i asked haworth is not a big town or a beautiful place how will you find children to teach we have thought of that too papa charlotte said we must learn more and become better teachers i have spoken to aunt branwell and she will give us the money if you agree emily and i want to go to belgium to learn french if we can speak french well then parents will send their children to us to learn that emily will go i said i looked at her emily had only been away from home twice and each time she had been very un happy but now she looked excited yes papa she said i will go charlotte is rightwe must do something and this will help us to stay together and anne i will stay as a governess with the robinson family anne said sadly there s not enough money for us all to go and the robinsons are not so very bad it was always like that anne was a gentle girl she did not fight as hard as the others perhaps her life was easier because of that i don t know but i thought it was a wonderful idea i wrote to belgium and found them places in a school in brussels which was owned by a monsieur h ger i agreed to take the girls there and for a month i wrote down french words in a little pocket book to help me on the journey then one afternoon in we caught the train to london i had not been to london for over twenty years and my daughters had never been there we stayed for three days and then we took the night boat to belgium and arrived at a tall fine school building in the centre of brussels h ger himself was a very polite friendly man very kind he did not always understand my french but he showed me round the school and talked a lot very fast i smiled and tried to answer the two girls were very excited when i left them as i came home on the boat i thought this is a good thing a fine thing perhaps my daughters will start a good school and ha worth will become famous i hope branwell can make a success of his life too then my wife maria will be pleased with us all monsieur h ger and mrs robinson at first everything went well monsieur h ger wrote to me often he was pleased with my daughters he said they were good pupils but life at home in haworth was hard my curate died and aunt branwell became very ill emily and charlotte came home to see her but she was dead before they arrived she was a good woman elizabeth branwell she kept my home for more than twenty years and she taught my daughters everything she knew but she never liked haworth i am sure of that she said it was a cold miserable place i hope that god has found somewhere warm and comfortable for her now but how could i live without her my eyes were now very bad and i could not see to read and our servant tabby was older than i was anne could not help me she was a gov erness for the robinson family and now branwell had a job there too teaching their young son so charlotte went back to brussels alone this time as a teacher in monsieur h ger s school emily stayed at home to cook and clean for me she did not like brussels she said she was happy to do the housework and live at home with tabby and me she was a strange quiet girl emily she was the tallest of the girls and in some ways she was as strong as a man she loved to walk by herself on the wild lonely moors with her dog keeper running by her side sometimes i saw her there singing or talking quietly to herself and i thought perhaps she could see the people in her secret world of gondal and was talking to them i know that she spent a lot of time writing alone in her room and when anne was at home she and emily often talked and wrote about the world of gondal together there were sometimes dangerous people near haworth so i always had a gun in the house before my eyes were bad i taught emily to shoot she loved that sometimes i used to practise shooting in the garden while she was making bread in the kitchen i shot first then i called emily she came out cleaned her hands picked up the gun shot and went back in to finish the bread she was much better at shooting than i was but by my eyes were too bad for shooting emily cooked cleaned the house played the piano and almost every day she went for long walks on the moors with her dog keeper she loved that dog but she could be very hard with him too we did not let him go upstairs but one day tabby found him on my bed emily was very angry her face was white and hard keeper was a big strong dog but she pulled him down stairs and hit him again and again until the dog was nearly blind then she gently washed his cuts herself he never went upstairs again charlotte was another year in brussels when she came home she was quiet and sad sometimes she wrote long letters in french to monsieur h ger but no letters came from him but this was a time of hope too the girls wrote advertise ments for their new school and sent them to newspapers and to everybody they knew it was exciting they were good ad vertisements and we waited for the first children to come we waited a long time and charlotte wrote more advertise ments no children came every day charlotte and emily waited for a letter from the postman or for a parent to come to see them every day they became more miserable anne left her job with the robinsons and came home to ha worth a month later branwell also came home for a holiday and then one morning early there was a knock on the door charlotte ran to open it but it was not a parent it was a letter for her brother branwell he went upstairs with it smiling a few minutes later there was a terrible scream we ran up stairs to branwell s room he lay on his bed screaming with a white face and wild dark eyes the letter was in his hand branwell what is it what s the matter i asked he tore his hair with his hands i m ill he said i m cold oh what does it matter she doesn t care i can t see her oh it s all finished now finished for ever i ll die without her here branwell drink this emily brought him a cup of hot milk but his hand was shaking and he nearly dropped it charlotte put her hand on his head he s hot papa he s burning she said you must go to bed at once branwell he went to bed and he lay there sometimes sleeping some times shouting and crying i tried to talk to him but i couldn t understand what he said then later anne explaind she told us a terrible story i was so angry i nearly broke a chair with my hands as i listened my son branwell anne said was in love with mrs robinson the rich mother of his pupil for months this lady had spoken kindly to branwell walked with him in the garden talked to him alone in the evenings he tnought she would marry him when her husband died and then there were other things that anne did not want to speak about the letter was from mr robinson he was often ill anne told us but his children knew about branwell and their mother and the servants knew too i think perhaps mr robin son had learnt something from them or perhaps that woman i cannot call her a wife had told him everything only one thing was certain in his letter mr robinson had ordered branwell never to return to his house or to speak to any of his family again my face was hot and my hands were shaking i tried to talk to branwell about it but it was impossible i love her papa he shouted you don t understand how can you you ve never seen her i don t want to see her my son i said i understand that she is a bad evil woman i hope that god will punish her and don t say that papa he screamed you are talking about the woman i love she will call me back i will see her again i hope you never see her again my son i said you must forget her branwell listen to me but he did not listen he ran out of the house he did not come back until the evening and then he was drunk he did not listen that day or the next day or any day he began to drink laudanum as well i thought he would kill himself so i think charlotte was pleased that no parents came no school could have a man like branwell in it currer ellis and acton bell at about this time in i was almost blind i had a new curate to do my work arthur nicholls a young man of twenty eight he came from northern ireland like my self he was a good hard worker i spoke in the church on sundays but arthur nicholls did the rest of my work branwell became worse and worse mr robinson died in but mrs robinson didn t marry branwell oh no she was a cold wicked woman she sent my son branwell away and later married a rich old man and so branwell spent more and more time drinking and taking laudanum and walking alone on the moors when you are blind you listen to things very carefully i used to sit alone in my room and listen to the sounds of the wind outside the house the wind talks and whispers and sings it has many voices i listened to the sounds of the clock on the stairs and the wood in the fire and the footsteps and voices of the girls walking round the house they talked a lot to each other and sometimes i could hear what they said even when they were in another room anne had had a poem published in a magazine and one day i heard a conversation between charlotte and emily charlotte had found something that emily had written and was talking to her about it but they re wonderful emily charlotte said they re much better than mine or anne s they re not for people to read emily said they re part of the gondal story nobody would understand them except me and anne i realized that they were talking about some poems of emily s i knew that emily and anne wrote a lot about the country of gondal but i didn t know much about it emily kept all her papers locked in her desk charlotte was arguing with her emily listen to me these are fine poems i think we should put some of them in a book togetner with mine and anne s and try to publish it people should read them no emily shouted then her dog keeper began to bark and i didn t hear any more but i think they talked about this again several times i often heard voices arguing and usually they never argued about their writing i wanted to tell them not to do it i had published several small books myself but i always lost money i had to pay the publisher to print the books and not many people bought them it s an easy way to lose money but i was too ill so i said nothing i learnt many years later that they paid over to have a book of poems printed and that it sold two copies i am not surprised that they didn t tell me about it we had very little i began to feel that there was something wrong with my head as well as my eyes several times the postman brought an old packet to our house which was addressed to a man called currer bell i told him that no currer bell lived in haworth and sent him away but then a month or two later he came back again with the same old packet in the summer of charlotte took me to see an eye doc tor in manchester we stayed in rooms in the town the doctor decided to operate on my eyes and the next morning we got up early i was afraid could i hold my head still while the doctor cut into my eyes with a knife perhaps the pain would be too terrible perhaps i would move or stand up or charlotte held my hand as we left our rooms we met a postman good morning miss he said there s packet here for currer bell oh thank you charlotte sounded sad but she took the packet and put it in her room she did not open it then we walked to the eye doctor s the pain was terrible but it was over in fifteen minutes and i didn t move afterwards i had to lie on a bed in a dark room we couldn t go home for a month a nurse came some times but charlotte stayed with me all day i asked her once about the packet she said oh it s for a friend of mine papa it had a letter for me in it i have posted it away again now i didn t understand but i didn t ask again i lay quietly on my bed most of the day and charlotte sat in the next room writing she wrote very fast for many hours and never put her pen down once she seemed quiet but strangely happy i was happy too the doctor had helped i could see again it was wonderful the colours the shapes of everything were beautiful when we came back to haworth i could see every thing clearly at last our home the church the graveyard the moors the faces of my emily and anne and branwell branwell s face looked terrible white thin with big dark eyes and untidy hair his clothes were dirty he smelt his hands shook all the time he was either shouting or crying and always every day he asked me for money i let him sleep in my room at night and he kept me awake for hours talking about mrs robinson i remembered his paint ings his stories his happy childish laughter my fine clever son had become a drunken animal the winter of was terribly cold the wind blew snow around the house and over the gravestones a lot of children died in the village anne was ill branwell was worse we lit fires in all the rooms but there was ice inside the windows in the mornings i spent most of my time with branwell so i didn t think very much about the girls and then one afternoon charlotte came into my room i was sitting here in this same chair beside the fire she had a book in her hand and that strange happy look on her face papa she said i ve been writing a book i smiled have you my dear i thought she had written another little book about angria yes and i want you to read it oh i m afraid it will hurt my eyes too much my eyes were much better but the tiny writing in the angria books was too small for me oh no she said it s not in my handwriting it is printed she held out the book in her hand my dear think how much it will cost you will almost certainly lose money because no one will buy it no one knows your name i don t think so father i didn t pay to get it printed you know the publishers paid me listen to what people say about it in these magazines she sat down and read to me from some of the most famous magazines in england there were long articles in them about a book called jane eyre by currer bell they were kind arti cles most of the magazine writers liked the book this currer bell then i ashed is it you charlotte laughed yes papa it s a man s name with the same first letters cb charlotte bront currer bell she gave me the book and went out i began to read i think i read for two hours but it seemed like ten minutes it was a wonderful beautiful book the story of a little girl called jane eyre her parents are dead so she lives with an un kind aunt and her children then jane goes away to a school called lowood this school is a terrible place and it is very like the school at cowan bridge jane eyre s best friend helen burns falls ill at the school and dies this helen is just like my own little maria when i read about her death my eyes fillled with tears but it was a beautiful book too i did not want to put it down at five o clock i got up and went into the sitting room my three daughters sat there waiting for me their eyes were very bright i still had tears in my eyes but i had a big smile on my face too i held up jane eyre in my hand and said girls do you know charlotte has written a book and it is more than good you know it is very very fine indeed the best days and the worst days emily and anne did know of course they had known about charlotte s book for a long time jane eyre was not the first book that charlotte had sent to a publisher over a year ago she had written another book the professor and sent it to one publisher after another each publisher had sent it back in a packet addressed to currer bell and then charlotte had sent it in the same old packet to another publisher and then another and got it back again why didn t you change the paper on the packet my dear i asked charlotte smiled i didn t think of it papa the worst day was when we were in manchester going to the eye doctor do you remember the packet came back then that was the day before i started writing jane eyre do you mean that you started writing jane eyre while i was lying in that dark room in manchester that s right papa but that s only six months ago and here is the book in my hand yes papa the book was printed a month after i sent it to the publisher my dear they decided very quickly that they liked it then i think they did papa after all it is a good book isn t it she smiled at me i don t think i have ever seen her so hap py she is a very small person charlotte and not a beautiful woman but when she smiles like that her face shines like a fine painting my wife maria used to look like that sometimes when i first met her i took her hand in mine it is a very good book my dear i cannot tell you how proud i am she touched my hand thank you papa but you must not be proud of me alone you know anne and emily oh no charlotte please emily said but charlotte did not stop anne and emily have writ ten books too books just as good as mine and their books will soon be published as well let me introduce you papa these young ladies are not your daughtersthey are acton bell and ellis bell brothers of the famous writer currer bell emily s face was bright red but anne and charlotte started laughing i was very surprised all three of you i said but but why do you use these strange names because people are stupid papa anne said no one thinks women can write good books so we have used men s names instead and now they say that currer bell is a writer who understands women very well she laughed again my dears my dears i held out my hands to them and kissed each of them in turn i don t know what to say i am so pleased for you all you have made your old papa happy to day something in emily s face stopped me emily you will let me read your book won t you she thought for a moment yes papa of course but it s very different from charlotte s i m not sure you ll like it you yourself are very different from charlotte my dear but i love you both you must show me the book as soon as it comes and you too anne i read both their books that winter they were very differ ent anne s book agnes grey was the story of an un happy governess as i read it i was sad to think how miserable anne had been in a big house away from home where no one understood her it was a good book but it was harder to read than jane eyre emily s book was called wuthering heights it was a terri ble frightening wonderful story there is love in it and hate and fear and a man called heathcliff who is strong and cruel like the devill himself i read it late one night when the wind was screaming round the house blowing snow against all the windows and sometimes i was afraid when i got up to go to bed i saw emily sitting quietly by the fire she was stroking her big dog keeper with one hand and drawing a picture with the other she looked like a quiet gentle young woman i thought tall pretty and also there was something different about her something very strange and very strong there was some thing in her that was stronger than any of her sisters even charlotte something stronger than even me or her brother branwell much stronger than branwell all that year branwell was very ill he spent more and more time drinking he slept most of the day and was awake half of then night his face was white his hands shook when he tried to write his sisters didn t tell him about their books or show him the new ones that they were writing they were afraid that he would be unhappy about their success because he had wanted to be a writer himself he made life hard for all of us is september he became very ill he coughed all day and all night he began to talk of death and asked us to pray with him while we stood together praying he began to cough again he fell to the ground emily and i put our arms round him but he couldn t get up there was blood on his mouth and on emily s dress when he stopped coughing it was because he had stopped breathing my only son was dead we buried him in the church beside his mother and little sis ters it was a cold rainy afternoon there were dead wet leaves in the graveyard and the wind blew rain into our faces i came back into the house soon afterwards but emily walked for an hour or two in the rain with her dog keeper when she came back into the house her dress was wet through several days later emily became ill her face was hot she couldn t eat she kept moving round the house it was difficult for her to breathe and it took her a long time to climb the stairs charlotte felt her heart it was beating a hundred and fifteen times a minute let me call a doctor emily charlotte said but emily refused if he comes i won t talk to him then go to bed and rest please i can light a fire in your room and bring you milk and read to you if you like you need rest sister i do not said emily slowly she had to breathe hard between each word and her face was as white as branwell s had been my body doesn t matter now i don t care about it i ll live as i always have and so every day she got up at seven o clock dressed her self and stayed downstairs until ten at night she ate little or nothing and coughed for hours sometimes she coughed blood she never went out of the house but one day charlotte brought some heather from the moors for her to look at emily was lying on the black sofa in the sitting room her dog keep er lay on the floor in front of her look emily charlotte said i ve found some purple heather for you there are still one or two flowers left on the moor where emily asked here look charlotte held out the small bright purple flower emily turned and looked at charlotte but i don t think she could see the heather her eyes were too bad charlotte put it in emily s hands but after a moment emily dropped it on the floor at last she said charlotte i will see the doctor now if he comes then she closed her eyes emily was so thin and her white skin looked like paper i knew it was too late but i said to anne quick put on your coat and fetch him now we did not have long to wait the doctor came half an hour later to tell us what we already knew emily my daughter was dead was a year of funerals i buried many children from the village that year there was a lot of sadness in haworth as i came out of the church with the dead flowers from emily s grave i saw three other families walk past me they had come to visit the graves of their own dead children the people understood that their children were with god but no one could explain that to emily s dog keeper he fol lowed us to her funeral and for weeks afterwards he lay out side her bedroom and howled arthur nicholls that was not the end of my sadness anne too became ill she could not breathe she coughed her face was white but she was more sensible than emily she took all her medicines and did everything the doctors said it didn t help much in the spring she said she wanted to go to the sea to a warmer place the doctors told her to wait i thought she would die before she went at last in may charlotte went away with her they went to york first where they visited a wonderful church york minster if men can make something as beautiful as this anne whispered what is god s real home like charlotte told me this in a letter she sent from scarborough a town by the sea on the north east coast on th may anne rode a donkey on the beach the letter said she was very happy papa afterwards we went to church and then sat and watched the sea for a long time on the th she was too ill to go out she died quietly at two o clock in the afternoon she will be buried in a graveyard near the sea anne was the baby of the family the youngest and prettiest of them all before she died she wrote another book the tenant of wildfell hall about a woman who left her cruel husband she was proud of it and so was i she was twenty nine years old i don t want to die papa she said i have too many ideas in my head too many books to write when charlotte came home the dogs barked happily per haps they thought anne and emily and branwell were coming home too i don t know but it was only charlotte the smallest of all my children not the prettiest not the strongest not the strangest god had taken all those for himself he had left me with the one who would become the most famous and the one who nearly had a child charlotte wrote two more books shirley about a strong brave woman like her sister emily and villette about love be tween a teacher and a pupil but jane eyre was her most fa mous book everyone in england talked abut it everyone wanted to read it charlotte went to london and met many famous writers i was very pleased i loved to hear about the people and places that she saw but she always came back to haworth she didn t like to be with famous people very long and this quiet place was her home in just before christmas a terrible thing happened i heard some of it from my room my curate arthur nicholls opened the door to charlotte s sitting room and stood there his face was white and he was shaking yes mr nicholls charlotte said do you want to come in no miss charlotte that is yes i meani have some thing important to say to you i heard his voice stop for a moment and then he went on i have always felt strongly about you miss charlotte and my feelings are stronger much stronger than you know and well the fact is miss charlotte that i am asking you to be my wife there was a long silence i heard every word and i felt cold and angry mr nicholls was a good curate but that was all i paid him a year to help me with my work but he had no place in my house or in my daughter s bed i stood up and opened my door mr nichols he turned and looked at me i could see charlotte behind him you will leave this house at once mr nicholls i am very very angry you must not speak to my daughter again ever do you understand me the stupid man was shaking and almost crying i thought he was ill he opened his mouth to speak but no words came out then he turned and went out of the door mr nicholls stayed in his own house for three days he re fused to eat the stupid man and he sent me some angry letters but charlotte wrote to him to say that she would not marry him then mr nicholls said he would leave haworth and go to australia on his last day in church he had to give people bread to eat but when he held out the bread to charlotte he could not do it because he was shaking and crying so much afterwards the people of haworth gave him a gold watch he cried aboutthat too i thought it was all finished but i was wrong i think he wrote to charlotte and she wrote back in april of he came back to haworth charlotte brought him into my room i looked at him but i said nothing i was not pleased papa charlotte said mr nicholls and i have something to say to you i did not like that mr nicholls and i it did not sound good to me i am busy i said i have a lot of work charlotte smiled that s because you don t have a good curate papa when mr nicholls was here your life was easy perhaps i said but he was going to australia i thought why haven t you gone sir mr nicholls spoke for the first time he looked very tall and proud i thought there are two reasons sir he said first because i have decided not to go to australia and also he stopped and looked down at charlotte she smiled up at him and i felt my blood run cold and also because your daughter charlotte and i would like to be married we have come to ask you to agree i don t remember what i said next i think there were a lot of unkind words between us and some tears but in the end i agreed i agreed because charlotte wanted it not because of arthur nicholls in june that year they were married in my church i did not go i could not give charlotte away to that man but he came back here to be my curate and he and charlotte lived in this house with me he is still here now perhaps he will read this if he does he will know that he was right and i was wrong mr nicholls was after all a good husband for charlotte i understood after a while that he honestly loved her and he could make her happy she began to smile and laugh again her eyes shone she sang sometimes as she worked our house became a home again she went with him to see his family in ireland and travelled to the far west of that country mr nicholls did most of my church work for me charlotte began a new book emma she called it and one day in december she came into my room smiling i could see that she was excited what is it my dear have you finished your book no not yet papa but i have something wonderful to tell you what do you think i don t know my dear if it s not your book then i told arthur yesterday i am going to have a child i did not say anything her hand was on the table and i put my hand on it gently it was wonderful news i remembered when my own wife maria had told me this and how this house had been full of the laughter of little voices and the noise of running feet charlotte and i sat like that for a long time re membering it did not happen at christmas she fell ill and in the new year she was worse she felt sick all the time because of the baby and she ate nothing she lay in bed all day hot and coughing arthur nicholls cared for her wonderfully i think he often stayed awake all night but it did not help on st march the last of my six children died it was early in the morning arthur nicholls was sitting by her bed and i was standing by the door she was asleep with her hand in his her face was very thin and pale she opened her eyes and saw him then she coughed and i saw fear in her face oh god she whispered i am not going to die am i please don t take me away from arthur now we have been so happy those were the last words she ever said a little while later i walked slowly out of the house as i went into the graveyard the church bell began to ring it was ringing to tell haworth and all the world that charlotte bront was dead maria and so now i have written it it is three o clock in the morning the house is very quiet and the wind has stopped i can hear the sound of the wood burning in the fire and the clock on the stairs somewhere upstairs arthur nicholls is sleeping quietly i know that charlotte s friend mrs gaskell has nearly fin ished her book about charlotte perhaps i will show her what i have written perhaps but i don t think so i wrote to her before and an swered her questions and that is enough she is a writer she can write her own book i will keep this book in my desk for myself and perhaps for arthur nicholls there is no need for other people to read it my daughter charlotte is famous al ready and when mrs gaskell has written about her she will be more famous still i wish my wife maria could read charlotte s books and emily s and anne s perhaps she can we had some fine children didn t we maria i wonder if she can hear me it is a fine night now that the wind has stoppod there is a bright moon and the sky is full of stars i think i will go outside and walk through the graveyard to the church and talk to maria there captain something is moving on the ice look over there the sailor stood at the top of the mast high above the captain his hand pointed away from the ship across the miles of ice that covered the sea the captain looked to the north where the sailor was pointing he saw something coming fast towards the ship across the ice he put his telescope to his eye and through it he could see the shapes of ten dogs pulling a sledge over the ice he could also see the driver of the sledge a huge figure much bigger than a man the sledge came nearer and nearer to the sea soon it was only a quarter of a mile from the ship no one needed a telescope now to see the huge figure of the driver suddenly the sledge went behind a mountain of ice and disappeared at that moment another sledge appeared it too was moving fast and was clearly chasing the first sledge this driver was a smaller figure more like an ordinary man faster and faster the dogs ran then the second sledge also disappeared behind the mountain of ice two hours passed the sledges did not appear again nothing moved on the ice soon night came and in the night there was a storm in the morning the sailors saw that great pieces of ice were floating round the ship suddenly the sailor on the mast shouted again captain i can see a man on the ice the sailor was pointing to a piece of ice that was floating near the ship a man was sitting on the ice and near him was a broken sledge the man was nearly dead from cold and could not walk the sailors carried him carefully onto the ship and took him to the captain who said welcome to my ship i am the captain and my name is robert walton thank you captain walton the man said my name is frankenstein victor frankenstein then he fainted and said no more two days passed before the man was strong enough to talk and then the captain asked him to tell his story i am trying to catch someone said frankenstein that is why i have come so far north on the ice we saw you following someone the captain said he was huge much bigger than a man we saw his sledge just in front of you on the night before the storm i am pleased you all saw that huge figure frankenstein said perhaps that will help you to believe my story during the days while the captain worked on the ship frankenstein wrote down his story and each evening he read what he had written to the captain here is victor frankenstein s story i was born in switzerland in the town of geneva my parents loved each other very much and i learnt from the example of their love i learnt that to love and to be patient are the most important things in the world my mother hoped to have a daughter after i was born but for five years i was the only child and then my mother found a sister for me she was helping a family in which there were five children they were very poor and the children were thin and hungry one of the children was a little girl with golden hair and blue eyes her name was elizabeth my mother took the little girl into our family and elizabeth became the daughter that my mother had always wanted as i grew older my love for elizabeth became stronger all the time later my mother had two other sons ernest and william a young woman called justine came to live in the house to help my mother with the children we loved her as much as she loved us the years passed happily and we had everything that we needed at school i met another very fine person his name was henry clerval and he was very clever my family also liked him very much so he was a welcome visitor to our house i studied very hard at school i wanted to know the secrets of life and most of all i wanted to know how to make living things i read all the books that i could find one day some thing happened that added a new idea to the ideas that i al ready had i was fifteen at the time and we were on holiday in the mountains there was a wild storm and with it came the most frightening thunder and lightning that i had ever seen in my life about twenty metres in front of our house was a great tree suddenly a huge fork of lightning hit the tree after a few seconds there was nothing left of it except a black piece of wood two metres high the lightning had destroyed it i saw how strong electricity was i began to read all the books that i could find about electricity and its terrible power for seventeen years my life was very happy then the first sad thing happened my mother became very ill and soon she knew that she was dying just before she died she asked elizabeth and me to go to her room she held our hands and said my children i am very happy because you love each other and because one day you will get married everyone in the family loves you elizabeth will you take my place in the family my dear i can die happy if you will look after them when i have gone my mother died and we were very sad because we loved her dearly elizabeth was brave and helped us her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother s death the time came for me to go to university i did not want to leave my sad family but we all knew that i should go it was hard to leave too because the parents of my good friend henry clerval would not let him go to university with me and so i had to go alone on my first day at the university i met my teacher professor waldman who was one of the greatest scientists in the world he gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university he ended his talk by saying some of you will become the great scientists of tomorrow you must study hard and discover everything that you can that is why god made you intelligent to help other people after the professor s talk i thought very carefully i remembered the storm when i was fifteen i remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree i wanted to use electricity to help people and i wanted to discover the secrets of life i decided to work on these two things i did not know then that my work would destroy me and the people that i loved i started work the next day i worked very hard and soon professor waldman and i realized that i could learn to be a very good scientist the professor helped me very much and other important scientists who were his friends helped me too i was interested in my work and i did not take one day s holiday during the next two years i did not go home and my letters to my family were very short after two years i had discovered many things and i built a scientific machine that was better than anything in the university my machine would help me answer the most important question of all how does life begin is it possible to put life into dead things to answer these questions about life i had to learn first about death i had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them in the hospital and in the university i watched the dying and the dead day after day month after month i followed death it was a dark and terrible time then one day the answer came to me suddenly i was sure that i knew the secret of life i knew that i could put life into a body that was not alive i worked harder and harder now i slept for only a short time each night and i did not eat much food i wrote to my family less often but they loved me and did not stop writing to me they said they understood how busy i was they did not want me to stop work to write or to see them they would wait until i had more time they hoped to see me very soon the professors realized that i was doing very important work and so they gave me my own laboratory there was a small flat above the laboratory where i lived and sometimes i stayed inside the building for a week and did not go out above the laboratory i built a very tall mast it was metres high and higher than the tallest building in the city the mast could catch lightning and could send the electricity down to my machine in the laboratory i had never forgotten the lightning that had destroyed the tree there had been so much power in the electricity of that lightning i believed i could use that electricity to give life to things that were dead i will say no more than that the secret of my machine must die with me i was a very clever scientist but i did not realize then what a terrible mistake i was making in my laboratory i made a body i bought or stole all the pieces of human body that i needed and slowly and carefully i put them all together i did not let anybody enter my laboratory or my flat while i was doing this awful work i was afraid to tell anybody my terrible secret i had wanted to make a beautiful man but the face of the creature was horrible its skin was thin and yellow and its eyes were as yellow as its skin its long black hair and white teeth were almost beautiful but the rest of the face was very ugly its legs and arms were the right shape but they were huge i had to use big pieces because it was too difficult to join small pieces together my creature was two and a half metres tall for a year i had worked to make this creature but now it looked terrible and frightening i almost decided to destroy it but i could not i had to know if i could put life into it i joined the body to the wires from my machine more wires joined the machine to the mast i was sure that my machine could use electricity from lightning to give life to the body i watched and waited two days later i saw dark clouds in the sky and i knew that a storm was coming at about one o clock in the morning the lightning came my mast began to do its work immediately and the electricity from the lightning travelled down the mast to my machine would the machine work at first nothing happened but after a few minutes i saw the creature s body begin to move slowly terribly the body came alive his arms and legs began to move and slowly he sat up the dead body had been an ugly thing but alive he was much more horrible suddenly i wanted to escape from him i ran out of the laboratory and locked the door i was filled with fear at what i had done for hours i walked up and down in my flat at last i lay down on my bed and fell asleep but my sleep was full of terrible dreams and i woke up suddenly the horrible thing that i had created was standing by my bed his yellow eyes were looking at me his mouth opened and he made strange sounds at me on his yellow face there was an awful smile one of his huge hands reached towards me before he could touch me i jumped off the bed and ran downstairs into the garden i stayed there all night but i could not think clearly i was afraid and when morning came i went out into the town and began to walk about i did not notice where i was walking but soon i came to the station a train from geneva had just arrived and the passengers were leaving the station one of them ran towards me when he saw me it was my dear friend henry clerval he was very pleased to see me he took my hand and shook it warmly my dear victor he said what a lucky chance that you are here at the station your father and elizabeth and the others are very worried about you because you have not visited them for a long time they ask me to make sure that you are well and i have very good news my father has agreed to let me study at the university so we shall be able to spend a lot of time together i was very happy to hear this news and for a moment i for got my fears i took henry back to my flat and asked him to wait outside while i went in to look i was afraid that the creature was still there but he had disappeared at that time i did not think of other people and what the creature could do to them i took henry into the flat and cooked a meal for us but henry noticed how thin i was and that i was laughing too much and could not sit still suddenly he said my dear victor what is the matter with you are you ill has something awful happened don t ask me that i cried i put my hands over my eyes i thought i could see the horrible creature there in front of me i pointed wildly across the room and shouted he can tell you save me save me i tried to fight the creature but there was nothing there then i fainted and fell to the floor poor henry i do not know what he thought he called a doctor and they put me to bed i was very ill for two months and henry stayed and looked after me his loving care saved me from death i wanted to go home and see my family as soon as possible when i was well enough i packed my clothes and books all my luggage was ready and i was feeling very happy when the postman arrived with some letters one of the letters ended my short time of happiness the letter was from my father in geneva and this is what he wrote my dear victor i want you to know before you arrive home that an awful thing has happened your dear youngest brother william is dead he was murdered it happened last thursday evening when elizabeth and i and your two brothers ernest and william went for a walk outside the city william and ernest were playing william had hidden from ernest and ernest asked elizabeth and me to help find william we all began to search for him but we couldn t find him we searched all night at five in the morning i found him he was lying on the grass white and still i could see the marks of fingers on his neck the murderer had strangled him elizabeth had let him wear a gold chain of hers round his neck on the chain was a very small picture of your mother we all think that someone murdered william to steal the gold chain poor elizabeth is terribly unhappy at william s death she thinks he died because she let him wear the chain hurry home my dear victor you are the only one who can help elizabeth and we all need you with all our love your father henry helped me to catch the train the journey seemed very long and it was late at night before the train reached geneva i decided to spend the night in a village outside the town and go home early in the morning i wanted to see the place where william had died as i started my walk a storm broke and lightning lit the sky the police had put posts round the place where the murderer had strangled william so i found it easily i cried sadly as i stood there my poor brother had been a kind and happy boy and we had all loved him again the lightning lit the sky and i saw a huge figure standing in the rain when i saw it i knew at once what it was it was the creature that i had made what was he doing there but although i asked myself the question i knew the answer he had murdered my brother i was sure that i was right i decided to try and catch him but as i moved he ran to wards the mountains he ran much faster than any man he climbed the mountain easily reached the top and disappeared i stood there in the dark and the rain and knew that i had created a monster and he had murdered my brother at first i decided to tell the police my story but would they believe me i had been very ill when the police learnt about my illness they would think the monster was just one of my bad dreams i decided that i could not tell anybody i went home to my family and they were very pleased to see me then they told me that the police had found the murderer perhaps you will think that this was good news but i have not told you who the police had arrested as i went into the house i noticed that one person did not come to meet me it was justine the young woman who looked after the children and who was like a sister to us and it was justine that the police had arrested a few days after the murder the police had searched the house and had found the gold chain in justine s coat pocket everyone in the family knew that justine had not murdered william i knew who the murderer was but i could not tell anyone we were sure that justine would be free after the trial because nobody could believe that she was a murderer but we were wrong the trial did not go well for justine there were a number of strange facts that were difficult to explain and the judge decided that she was the murderer the punishment for murder was death we argued and cried we said she could not murder anyone but nothing could change the judge s order so i got up early and went to the judge s house and told him about the monster he did not believe me he thought i was lying in order to save justine s life in the prison justine waited quietly for death we spent many hours with her and she spoke calmly and kindly to us she was happy because we believed that she had not killed william and she was almost looking forward to death be cause then she would be with william and our dear mother in a place of peace her love and gentleness added to my great unhappiness i knew she was going to die because of me i knew my brother had died because of me i had brought nothing but sadness and misery to my family i took a boat and went out on lake geneva why didn t i end my life then two things stopped me my father was old and another death would probably kill him and i had to stay alive to keep my family safe from the monster fear for my family and hate for my monster were with me day and night i became ill again and elizabeth s love could not help me i needed o escape for a while to leave my unhappiness behind me so i went to walk alone in the alps i hoped the wild beauty of the mountains would help me slowly i became calmer among the beautiful mountains i learnt to sleep again and for days i did not see anybody then one morning i saw a figure coming towards me faster than any man could go it jumped easily over the rocks and i saw with horror the monster that i had created on his face was a look of deep sadness but also of evil at first i could not speak be cause i hated him so much but at last i said you are an evil creature i shall kill you if i can because you have killed two people that i love the monster s yellow eyes looked at me i am the unhappiest creature in the world but i shall fight for my life he said i am bigger and stronger than you but i will not start the fight i shall always be gentle to you because you are my king and creator you made me and you should love me and be kind to me like a father william and justine died because you did not love me why did you create me if you were not ready to love me we are enemies i said leave me now or let us fight until one of us is dead you are a murderer how can i be kind to you you say i am a murderer the monster said but you want to kill your own creature isn t that wrong too i ask you to do one thing for me listen come with me to a warmer place and listen to my story then you can decide i thought carefully about what he had said it was true that i had given him life but i had not given him love i decided to go with him and listen to his story he took me to a mountain hut where he lit a fire we sat down by the fire and he began to tell me his story after i had left the laboratory i escaped into the country outside the town i soon felt hungry and thirsty and my first food was fruit which i found on some trees near a river i drank from the river and then lay down and went to sleep at first my eyes and ears did not work very well but after a while i began to see and hear clearly one day snow began to fall of course i had never walked in snow before and i found that it made my feet very cold i realized that i needed food and a place to get warm soon i saw a small hut where an old man was cooking his breakfast over a fire when the old man saw me he shouted loudly and ran away as fast as he could i did not understand what the man was doing but i wanted to be near the fire so i sat down in the warm and ate the man s breakfast then i walked across empty fields for some hours until i reached a village i went into one of the houses but there were children inside they began to scream when they saw me and their mother fainted the whole village came to see what was the trouble some of the people ran away when they saw me but the others shouted and threw stones at me they wanted to kill me i was badly hurt but i escaped and ran into the open country later i found an empty hut which was built against the wall of a small house i was afraid to go into the house after what had happened in the village so i hid in the hut there i was safe and could escape from the cold and hide from people who wished to hurt me and then i found that there was a small hole in the wall between the hut and the house through this hole i could see in to the room next to the hut three people lived in the house a beautiful girl an old man and a young man day after day i watched the three people i saw how kind they were to each other i wanted so much to go into the house and be with them but i knew i must stay in the hut i could not forget how the village people had hurt me when i tried to go into the house there each night after the people in the house had gone to bed i stole some of their food for myself but soon i realized that the old man was blind and i realized too that often the three of them did not have enough to eat i saw the two young people put extra food on the blind man s plate although they were hungry themselves when i saw that i stopped stealing their food their life was already hard enough so i went back to the wild fruit in the woods i tried to help them in other ways too during the night i cut firewood for them and added it secretly to the wood which the young man had cut during the day i was very happy to see how much this pleased the young man after a while i began to understand some of the noises that the people made to each other the first words that i under stood were words like fire and bread i also learnt that the three people called each other by names the girl was agatha the young man was felix and the old man was called father i tried to make the noises that they made and slowly i began to speak the two young people were very beautiful one day i saw my own face in the water of the river it was a terrible face i understood why people were frightened why they shouted and threw stones i knew then that i could not let these beautiful people see me they would be frightened by my horrible face and body summer was coming and i continued to watch and learn i also continued to help the two people and their father and did many jobs for them in the night they were always surprised in the morning when they saw what i had done i heard them talk about the good creature who did these wonderful things but the family were often sad and i wished i could make them happy i looked forward to the time when i could speak well enough to talk to them and i was happy because i was sure i would soon have three good friends one day in summer a lady on horseback rode up to the house and knocked on the door she had dark hair and was very beautiful the family were all very pleased to see her i soon learnt that her name was sophie she could not speak the family s language and each evening felix taught her some words this was a very great help to me because i was able to learn the meaning of many words that i had not been able to understand before felix taught sophie from books about what had happened in the world in the past so i learnt about the greeks and romans and about christ and about the first white men in america and the sad story of the indians i could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other i learnt other things too i learnt that people think it is very important to have money and to come from a good family i learnt of the love between mother and father and child and i realized that i had no family the more i learnt the more i thought and the more unhappy i became soon i discovered who sophie was the two families had met in france after sophie and her father arrived there from turkey their own country sophie s father was put in prison by the french but felix and his father helped him to escape and leave france when the french discovered this felix and his family lost all their lands and money and had to leave france for ever now i knew why they were so sad and why they were poor but that was not all sophie and felix loved each other and sophie s father had promised that they could marry then when he learnt that felix had lost all his money he broke his promise but sophie loved felix very much so she took some money and escaped from her father to search for felix i had learnt to love these good people and i could not wait another day to introduce myself i decided to speak first to the father because he was blind and would not be frightened by my terrible face and body one day the three young people went for a walk while the old man rested when they had gone i went to the door of the house and knocked on it the old man told me to enter and to sit down thank you i said i am a traveller and i m tired and sad i have no family or friends the people that i want to have as my friends have never seen me if they don t take me into their home i shall be alone in the world don t be so sad the old man said you will find that the hearts of men are full of love if these friends are good people they will welcome you they are kind and the best people in the world i said but when they meet me they may not see a kind creature who has helped them instead they may see a monster and they will hate me that mustn t happen the old man said my family and i have had our difficult times and we ll help you you are a very good man i said and if you help me i shall be able to live with my friends and enjoy their love at that moment i heard the young people returning from their walk i caught the old man s hand and cried now is the time save me and help me you and your family are the friends that i am talking about then the door opened and in came felix sophie and agatha their faces were filled with horror and fear when they saw me agatha fainted and sophie ran out of the house felix ran forward and pulled me away from his father he threw me to the ground and hit me again and again with his heavy stick i did not lift a hand against him i did not want to hurt him or any of them my heart was heavy and all hope left me i ran out of the house and later returned silently to my hut nobody saw me isat in my dark hut and felt both angry and sad one half of me wanted to hurt the people who had hurt me the other half of me still loved them in the end i decided to try to speak to the old man again i fell into an unhappy sleep but when i woke in the morning the family had gone they had left the house during the night i knew the name of only one other person although i had seen you frankenstein for only a few moments i knew that i belonged to you when i had left your house i had picked up a small bag there was a book in the bag and i could now read it from it i learnt my creator s name and address you had made me but why had you not looked after me and saved me from this pain and unhappiness i decided to go to geneva to find you one day as i was travelling i saw a young girl running along the side of a river suddenly she fell into the water i jumped into the river fought against the fast moving water and brought her back to land while i was doing this the girl s father who was looking for her reached us he was carrying a gun and when he saw me he fired the bullet hit my arm and broke it i fell to the ground in great pain and the man and the girl ran into the woods as fast as they could and left me the bullet was deep in my arm and i lost a lot of blood after some days my arm began to get better but i became sadder and angrier than before i had saved the girl s life and how did they thank me with a bullet in the arm i began to realize that there was no happiness for me in life hate grew stronger in me every day hate for you my creator who had made me two months later i reached geneva that evening i hid among some trees outside the town and went to sleep but i woke when a little boy ran into my hiding place i thought i would catch the child and make him my friend before he was old enough to be frightened of my terrible face i caught the little boy but when the child saw me he covered his eyes with his hands and screamed loudly let me go you monster the child shouted let me go or i will tell my father mr frankenstein he will call the police and they ll punish you frankenstein i shouted you belong to my enemy the man that i want to hurt the child fought and screamed and i put my hand round his neck to stop him shouting in a moment the child lay dead at my feet i looked down at his body and was pleased with what i had done i knew that the death of this child would hurt you victor frankenstein my creator then i saw something bright round the child s neck it was a gold chain and on the end of it was a picture of a very beau tiful woman i knew that a beautiful woman would never smile at me and i wanted to run into geneva and kill as many people as i could but i stopped myself and went to look for an other hiding place soon i found a hut which seemed to be empty but when i entered i saw a pretty young woman asleep on the floor i hated her because she was pretty so i put the gold chain into one of her pockets and then before she could wake up i ran away i knew the police would think that she had killed the little boy the monster finished telling me his story and then he said i am alone and miserable only someone as ugly as i am could love me you must make another creature like me a woman monster to be my wife i shall never make another creature like you i shouted you have done enough evil on your own if you don t help me i shall make you more miserable than you have ever been in your life you will wish you were dead the monster said but if you make another monster to be my friend we won t hurt anyone be kind to me now and i will learn to love and be kind i thought long and hard about the monster s words i felt sorry for him he was so miserable perhaps i should help him i shall do what you ask i told him but you must promise to live somewhere in the world where nobody lives you must promise to stay away from other people i promise i promise he cried please start your work i shall watch you and when you are ready you can be sure i will come back he turned and left me and ran down the mountain i went back to geneva immediately my family were very worried when they saw me i was pale and my eyes were wild i could not forget my promise to the monster and the awful work that waited for me but i had to do it it was the only way to keep my family safe safe from his murdering hands around their necks i needed to study for several months to make a woman monster successfully i heard that an english scientist had done some useful work so i decided to go to england before i went my father asked me are you going to marry elizabeth or do you love another woman is this why you are so unhappy no father i replied i have always loved elizabeth and i want to marry her but i must do one more piece of scientific work before we can marry i must go to england to do the work and i want to marry elizabeth when i return my father and elizabeth did not want me to go to england alone because i had been so ill they spoke to my old friend henry clerval and he was very happy to travel with me i was pleased that he could come although i did not want him to discover anything about my horrible work henry and i reached london in early october and stayed there for a few months i met and talked with english scientists and learnt many useful things from them then henry was invited to visit some friends in scotland i planned to travel with him but i told him that i wanted to go walking in the mountains alone henry was not happy with my plan but in the end he agreed i bought all that i needed for a laboratory and sent every thing to scotland henry and i travelled to edinburgh together and then i went further north to find a good place for my laboratory at last i found the right place on an island off the north coast it was a wild and lonely place only five people lived on the island so i could work alone and nobody would discover my awful secret there was a large empty hut on the island and i brought builders from scotland to make the hut into a laboratory for me i showed them how to build my mast and soon everything was ready for me to start work on the woman monster one evening two months later i was sitting in my lab oratory most of my work was done and i could finish the woman monster that night but i wondered if i should finish the work was i making a monster more evil than the first creature perhaps a thousand times more evil how could i know perhaps the woman monster would be another murderer she had not promised to stay away from other people perhaps the two monsters would hate each other and would kill and murder and destroy without end as i thought these things i looked up at the window suddenly in the moonlight i saw the monster s awful face looking at me and in his yellow eyes i could see only hate and evil i knew he would not keep his promise i went over to the laboratory table where the new creature was lying i pulled off the wires that joined her to my machine i took a sharp knife and cut through the body that i had joined together so carefully through the window the monster saw me destroy his woman with a loud and miserable scream of sadness and lost hope he ran into the laboratory you have destroyed all my hopes of happiness he cried you have left me with one feeling hate and with one wish to destroy your happiness you will be sorry that you were ever born remember this i shall be with you on your wedding night he ran quickly out of the laboratory and i watched him as he left the island in his boat and sailed away across the sea i sat and cried as i thought of the danger to elizabeth but i knew that the monster would not visit us until our wedding night i would not die easily and i would try to kill him before he could kill me the next morning i received a letter from henry he told me that he was waiting for me to return i decided to clear the laboratory and to leave the island on the following day so i re turned to the laboratory where the pieces of the woman monster s body still lay on the floor i put them all in a large bag with some heavy stones then i took the bag to my boat and sailed out to sea i threw the bag into deep water and watched it disappear i was happier than i had felt for months i knew i had done the right thing and now there would be no second monster to follow the first i was very tired and i went to sleep in the boat i do not know how long i slept but when i woke up i was in the middle of a storm the wind was driving me further out to sea and my boat began to fill with water i knew i was in great danger after some hours the storm passed and i saw land to the south soon i could see the beach and a crowd of people standing and watching me their faces were cold and unfriendly as i landed four of the men came towards me and took me by the arms we are taking you to mr kerwin the judge he wants to ask you some questions about the murder of a man here last night one of the men told me i was sad to hear of the murder but i did not worry about it i had been far away at the time and knew nothing about any murder it would be easy to explain that so i went with the men to the large house where judge kerwin lived the judge was an old kind man but his face was very serious as he looked at me he asked a number of men to tell me what they had seen and found the night before the first man told his story he and his son were coming home from a long day s fishing it was a dark night and on the beach they had fallen over the dead body of a man they had carried the body to the nearest house and found that it was a good looking young man about twenty five years old there were the marks of fingers round his neck when they spoke of the marks of fingers i remembered the murder of my brother and i felt a terrible fear the son then told his story he had seen a boat with a man in it not far from the beach he thought it was my boat a woman had also seen a man in a boat sailing away from the beach she thought i was the man then i was taken to the room where the dead body lay how can i tell you what i felt when i saw the body i put my arms round it and cried what have i done my friend my dear friend the body was henry clerval s and so now i had destroyed another person this third death was too much for me i fell down in a kind of madness and they had to carry me from the room for two months i was very ill and wished only to die but slowly my madness left me and my health began to return at last i was able to speak to judge kerwin and i asked for news of my family there is someone here who can answer your question better than i can he said your father arrived a few minutes ago and is waiting to see you for the first time since henry s death i felt some happiness i held out my hands to my father as he came into the room and he took me in his arms he gave me the good news that elizabeth and ernest were safe and well i was really too ill to travel but i asked my father to take me home immediately the police had found somebody who had seen me on my island at the time of the murder and so the judge let me go free my father looked after me on the long journey home and sat with me for every minute night after night while i was asleep i shouted that i was the murderer of william justine and henry my father asked me why i said these awful things i wanted to answer his question but i could not tell him my terrible secret he thought that i was still a little mad we stayed for a few days in paris on the way home and elizabeth wrote to me at our hotel this is what her letter said my dearest victor i am so happy to know that you will soon be home but i am afraid that henry s death is not the only reason for your sadness do you still want to marry me or do you love an other woman you must tell me i love you victor and i dream of the day when i shall be your wife but i do not want you to marry me just because your parents wanted it i can only be happy if you are happy do not answer this letter wait until you arrive before you give me your answer but if you are well and if i can make you smile i need nothing more to make me happy with all my love elizabeth i replied immediately i told her that i loved her very much and wanted to marry her i remembered the monster s promise to be with me on the night of my wedding let him come we would fight to the death on that night and after that fight i would either be dead and at peace or alive and free free to be happy with elizabeth we arrived in geneva soon after my letter had reached elizabeth it was wonderful to see her again she ran into my arms and i held her close she cried when she saw how thin and old i looked she too was thinner because she had worried about me so much but her gentleness and her love made her as beautiful as ever we agreed that the wedding would be in ten days time as the day came nearer i became more and more afraid i tried to hide my fear and laughed and smiled as often as i could elizabeth knew that i was unhappy but she was sure she could give me happiness she looked forward to our wedding i began to carry a gun and a knife with me everywhere i went after the wedding a large number of our friends came to a party at our house when the party had started elizabeth and i said goodbye and left for our honeymoon we travelled first by boat and planned to spend the night at a hotel on the other side of the lake the mountains and the lake were calm and beautiful and at last elizabeth and i were together for the first time for months and for the last time ever i enjoyed the feeling of happiness in the evening the wind became stronger and soon a great storm broke above us every noise frightened me and i kept my hand on my gun under my coat i saw the monster in every shadow suddenly i realized how terrible the fight would be for elizabeth i asked her to go to bed and i decided to search for the monster i planned to join her when i was sure he was not in or around the hotel elizabeth left me and i searched every corner of the hotel every dark doorway and staircase i could not find him and i began to hope that he had not followed us to the hotel but suddenly i heard a loud and terrible scream it came from our room then too late i understood the monster had promised to be with me on my wedding night but he had not planned to kill me the scream came again and i ran to our room why did i not die there and then on the bed elizabeth lay still in the cold sleep of death i took her in my arms and saw the marks of the murderer s fingers on her neck other people in the hotel had heard the screams and came into our room i sent one of them to call the police the others left me alone with my misery i held elizabeth close and as i held her i saw the monster watching me through the open window of the room there was an evil laugh on his face i pulled my gun from my coat and fired at him i missed and he ran from the window and jumped into the lake the other people heard the noise of the shot and came back into the room i showed them the place where the monster had jumped into the lake we searched the edge of the lake but we could not find him i returned to our room and lay on the bed next to my dear wife suddenly i had another terrible thought at this very moment perhaps my father was fighting the monster with ernest dead at his feet i left the hotel and returned to geneva as fast as i could my father and ernest were safe but the awful news of elizabeth s death killed my father he had loved elizabeth dearly he be came ill and after a few days he died in my arms so the evil monster had brought unhappiness and death to a dear old man who had never hurt anybody i do not know what happened next i think i left the real world and entered a dangerous world of dreams and madness later i found that they had put me in prison because of my madness after many months they let me free i had only one wish to find and kill the monster i decided to leave geneva for ever i took all the money that i needed and left the town before i left i went to visit the place where william elizabeth and my father lay at rest i stood there and promised them that i would stay alive until i had killed the monster a loud evil laugh rang out through the silent night then i heard the monsters s voice it pleases me that you have decided to live because that is just what i want i ran towards the voice but i could not catch the monster i saw him running away but he ran faster than any man could go too fast for me to catch but i followed him and i have been following him since that day i shall stay alive until i can catch him he wants me to live as long as possible he wants me to feel day after day the pain and misery that he has given me he leaves messages to tell me where he is he knows that i shall follow him i am only happy when i am asleep i dream that i am with my family and elizabeth and henry when i am awake i look forward to my death to the day when i shall be with them in his last message the monster told me that he was going north he wanted to take me where the cold would hurt me and make me more miserable i followed him to the cold lands of the north and bought dogs and a sledge until now he has always left me further and further behind when i chase him but the dogs were very fast and i was getting closer and closer to him soon he was only one day s journey in front of me he was going towards the sea and i hoped to catch him before he reached it the chase over the ice continued for about three weeks the pain from the cold was very great and i began to lose hope i thought i would never catch him my dogs could not run much further and one of them died then i saw some thing on the ice in front of me it was the monster and his sledge suddenly i was full of hope again and i gave a great shout of happiness i got closer and closer to him then a great storm started the ice began to break and the sea carried him away from me my sledge was broken and i lost my dogs i was left on a piece of ice that was becoming smaller all the time many hours went by and then i saw your ship the rest you know i ask you captain walton to chase the monster and kill him do not listen to what he says he knows how to argue and perhaps you will feel sorry for him but remember that he is evil remember the deaths of william justine henry clerval elizabeth my father and remember me victor frankenstein there is no more for me to say except to thank you captain walton for your help and kindness thank you also for listening to my story i want you to tell the world that the monster is a danger to everyone i know that i have only a few hours left to live but i can feel my loved ones near me and i welcome death goodbye this is the end of victor frankenstein s story i captain robert walton have added this final note to the story when you have read it you will know that victor frankenstein s story was true victor frankenstein died a few hours after he had written his last word i was sad to see him die because he had become a good friend but he will not be unhappy or in pain any more and i am happy for him we laid his body in a cabin near my own later i heard a voice coming from the cabin i went into the cabin and saw a huge shape standins over the dead body i knew that the horrible creature which was standing there was frankenstein s monster so i have killed you too the monster said to frankenstein s body oh frankenstein forgive me how i wish you could answer me i went towards him and said it is too late for frankenstein to forgive you he is dead his pain is ended you do not know how much pain and unhappiness i have felt said the monster i knew that i was doing evil things but i could not stop myself do you think i enjoyed killing people my heart was made for love like a man s heart after i killed henry clerval i hated myself but i could not stop myself from more murder frankenstein would not give me a wife but he hoped to find happiness with a wife of his own he was not fair to me but now it is ended frankenstein is the last person i shall kill i have done all those evil things but am i the only person who has done wrong i wanted love and friendship think about felix and his family who hated me after i had given them love think about the man who shot me after i had saved his little girl from the river but i know that i have done evil and i hate myself more than you hate me my own death is near i shall leave this ship and go north across the ice i shall build a great fire and lie down on it to die i shall welcome the pain of the fire because it will help me to forget the pain in my heart i have felt more pain than frankenstein and when the fire has died down i shall be at peace the monster jumped from the cabin window as he said this he got into the small boat in which he had reached the ship the sea soon carried him away and he was lost in the darkness a new start mr duncan come in please mr wilson will see you now thank you john duncan stood up and walked nervously towards the door he was a tall thin man about forty five years old in an old grey suit it was his best suit but it was ten years old now he had grey hair and glasses his face looked sad and tired inside the room a man stood up to welcome him mr duncan pleased to meet you my name s david wilson this is one of our chemists mary carter john duncan shook hands with both of them and sat down it was a big office with a thick carpet on the floor and beautiful pictures on the walls david wilson was a young man in an expensive black suit he had a big gold ring on one finger he smiled at john i asked miss carter to come because she s one of our best chemists she discovered our wonderful new paint in fact when i mean if you come to work here you will work with her oh i see john looked at mary she was older than wil son about thirty five perhaps with short brown hair and a pretty friendly face she was wearing a white coat with a lot of pens in the top pocket she smiled at him kindly but john felt miserable i ll never get this job he thought i m too old employers want younger people these days david wilson was looking at some papers now mr dun can he said i see that you are a very good biologist you worked at a university and then for two very famous com panies but you stopped working as a biologist nine years ago why was that i ve always had two interests in my life john said biol ogy and boats my wife was a famous sailor rachel hors ley perhaps you remember her she sailed around the world alone in a small boat yes said david wilson i remember her so we started a business said john we made small boats together and sold them and did the business go well asked wilson very well at first then we wanted to build bigger better boats we borrowed too much money and then my wife john stopped speaking yes the sevens race i remember now said david wil son both men were silent for a moment wilson remembered the newspaper reports of the storm and the lives lost at sea he looked at the man who sat sadly in front of him so after my wife died continued john i closed the business that was five years ago i see said david wilson it s a hard world the world of business he looked at john s old grey suit so now you want a job as a biologist well this is a chemical company mr duncan we make paint but we need a biologist to make sure that everything in this factory is safe we want someone to tell the government that it s safe to work here and that it s safe to have a paint factory near the town that s impor tant to us and if something s not safe then of course we ll change it mary carter said david wilson looked at her but he didn t say anything yes i see john began nervously well i think i could do that i mean when i worked for harper chemicals in lon don i he talked for two or three minutes about his work david wilson listened but he didn t say anything ihen he smiled it was a cold hard smile and it made john feel un comfortable he remembered his old suit and grey hair and he wished he hadn t come you really need this job don t you mr duncan david wilson said you need it a lot yes i do he said quietly but he thought i hate you wilson you re enjoying this you like making people feel small i hate people like you wilson s smile grew bigger he stood up and held out his hand ok he said when can you start what john was very surprised what did you say i said when can you start mr duncan we need you in our factory as soon as possible will monday be ok you mean i ve got the job of course congratulations wilson shook john s hand my secretary will tell you about your pay you ll have your own office and a company car of course i d like you to start work with mary on monday is that ok i yes yes of course that s fine thank you thank you very much at home hi dad your supper s in the kitchen john s sixteen year old daughter christine was sitting at the table doing her homework his son andrew who was thirteen was watching television thanks christine john said i m sorry i m late is everything ok fine thanks christine gave him a quick smile then con tinued with her work john got his food from the kitchen fried fish and chips the food was dry and didn t taste very good but he didn t say anything about that john was not a good cook himself and his children were no better his wife had been a good cook he remembered john tried to eat the terrible supper and looked around the small miserable flat the furniture was twenty years old the wallpaper and carpets were cheap and dirty the rooms were all small and he could see no trees or gardens from the win dows just the lights from hundreds of other flats and there were books clothes and newspapers on the floor once when his wife had been alive he had had a fine house a beautiful big house in the country with a large gar den they had had lots of new furniture two cars expensive holidays everything they needed he had had a good job they hadn t needed to think about money and then he had started the boat building company and his luck had ended when rachel had died john had been terribly unhappy much too unhappy to think about business a few months later his company had closed and he had lost all his money john had had to sell his beautiful house in the country and move to this miserable flat and for the last two years he hadn t had a job at all he was a poor man and an unlucky one too he had tried for lots of jobs and got none of them there were too many bright young biologists but now that was all going to change he looked at his daughter and smiled did you have a good day at school christine he asked her oh all right i suppose she said she didn t look very happy i ve got a letter for you she pushed the letter across the table and he opened it it was from her school one of the teachers was taking the chil dren on a skiing holiday to the mountains in switzerland it cost for ten days parents who wanted their children to go had to send the money to the school before february th john s smile grew bigger do you want to go on this holi day christine he asked she looked at him strangely of course i do dad she said but i can t can i we haven t got no i suppose not he looked at her carefully through his thick glasses she was a clever strong girl good at her schoolwork good at sports but she had never been skiing john hadn t had enough money are your friends going he asked her some of them yes miranda jane nigel the rich ones you know but they often go skiing it s easy for them i know i can t go dad throw the letter away john looked at her and felt his heart beating quickly no don t do that christine he said perhaps you can go if you want to why not christine laughed what s happened dad have you robbed a bank or something john stood up he went into the kitchen and got himself a drink no he said when he came back but something interesting happened today put your homework away chris tine and turn that tv off andrew i ve got something to tell you oh not now dad said andrew this is an exciting story john smiled i ve got an exciting story too andrew come and listen john duncan s children lived in an old untidy flat they had no money and they often ate awful food bux they could still talk to their father so andrew turned off the tv and sat down in a big armchair beside his father and christine the story didn t sound very exciting at first i went to a factory today john said that paint factory by the river no wait andrew paint factories can be very exciting they gave me a job there i m going to have my own office a big car lots of money in fact we re going to be rich rich man john duncan started work on monday and mary carter showed him round the factory the most important thing that the company produced was a new paint for cars it was a very strong hard paint which nothing could damage mary and her chemists had developed it and they had tested it all over the world neither acid nor salt water could damage it and cars came back from both the arctic and the sahara looking like new the company was beginning to make a lot of money from this paint and it had brought four hundred new jobs to the town one day when he was working with the paint john spilt some of the waste products on his leg he cleaned it off quickly but it left a red painful place on his skin which would not go away it kept him awake at night he told his doctor what he had spilt on it and the doctor looked at him strangely so these chemicals had something to do with the new paint did they the doctor asked carefully yes i told you it was a bottle of the waste products i was looking at them in my office i see the doctor looked out of the window thoughtfully his fingers moved quietly on his desk and your company is producing a lot of these waste products now i suppose yes of course john was in a hurry he had to meet someone important in ten minutes look can you give me something to put on it or not oh yes the doctor began to write something on a piece of paper put this on night and morning and the pain will go in a day or two but i m afraid the skin there will stay red for a year or two they re nasty chemicals mr duncan you know yes i know john smiled at him but don t worry doctor we re very careful with them in the factory no one can go near them without special safe clothing you can come and see if you like i m very pleased to hear it said the doctor he gave the piece of paper to john thank you said john he went towards the door mr duncan yes john looked back surprised where do these waste products go when the factory has finished with them into the river well yes of course said john but it s all right you know he added quickly it s very carefully checked all the time it s a big river and we only produce a few hundred litres of the waste products a day and we re only two kilo metres from the sea after all good said the doctor i wouldn t want anyone to drink those waste products that s all they won t doctor said john all the drinking water comes out of the river five kilometres upstream you know that who s going to drink salt water from the river mouth for heaven s sake chemists from london have checked it too you know and our company lawyers know all about it so it s not dangerous and we re not doing anything wrong don t worry about it he went out of the door and after half an hour he had for gotten the conversation he was a very busy man now all day he had to test differ ent types of paints and make sure they were safe he was also busy buying a big comfortable house for his family with a large field beside it where christine could keep a horse the house was half a kilometre from the sea and its gardens went down to the river there was an empty boathouse there can we have a boat dad andrew asked i mean not now of course but one day when you ve finished paying for the house perhaps john laughed his children had been poor for so long but now he could buy them anything they wanted you can have a boat now if you want my son he said happily if i can afford a big house like this i can certainly afford a small boat we ll go fishing every week shall we and i ll teach you both to sail in the evenings i ve always wanted to do that you know he could not believe how lucky he was he had a good job at last a fine home and his children had everything they wanted he only wished his wife rachel was alive to enjoy it with him there was only one thing that he could not give his children now he could not give them back their mother the seals a few months later john invited mary to a meal in the new house it was a difficult evening he had never invited anyone to their old flat and the children s friends nev er came for meals the new house was very untidy and john was nervous about the food he and christine cooked a chick en because they thought it was easy but the chicken was tasteless and the rice was too soft mary smiled and pretended not to notice but the evening went badly christine was angry with her because she tidied up the kitchen and andrew was angry with her because she didn t want to watch tv both the children went to bed early and thought about their mother but mary came again on a sunday and john took them all out in their new boat that was much better mary didn t know how to sail so the children had to tell her what to do she did what she was told and seemed to be happy john sat at the back of the boat and watched his children quietly he felt proud of them and he thought they were proud of him too the first time mary and the children laughed together john felt a big smile come onto his face it was a beautiful sunny day in the middle of may there was a good wind and the sailing was fun the boat sailed fast over small white topped waves the sky was blue and clear they sailed down to the mouth of the river where there were lots of small islands and sandbanks look dad quick over there what are they andrew pointed excitedly to one of the long low sandbanks seals said john haven t you seen them before no said andrew only in films not in real life his face was shining excited happy do they really live here yes it s a group of seal families the mothers come here every year to have their babies they sailed closer to the sandbank until they were only about twenty metres away from the seals wet shiny seal mothers lifted their heads and looked at them with their blue eyes the baby seals were drinking milk from their mothers climbing over them and playing in the shallow water then a big father seal lifted his head and stared angrily at them i think they re beautiful said mary i never knew they lived here so close to the town it makes me feel really happy just to see them yes it does doesn t it said christine i think nothing can be really wrong with the world if they can live here all by themselves with no one looking after them yes said mary and they re really beautiful too look did you see that little one playing on his mother s back i wish i could do that john smiled as he watched mary and his children laughing and talking together he thought the world was a good place too the new experiment a few days later john asked mary to look at another experiment he took her into a long quiet room at the back of the factory the room was full of the noises of small animals i ve been testing the waste products he said here look at this he gave her a sheet of paper some of these rats have had the waste products in their food and drinking water there s no real problem yet one or two have become ill but not many there s nothing very serious mary read the results carefully she didn t like this kind of experiment but she knew it was necessary and john was right no rats had died and not very many were ill so what do you want to show me she asked this he said he opened a box by the window these ten rats have had the waste products in their drinking water for two weeks now i gave them a lot five parts per million they re going to have babies today if the babies are ok we ve got nothing to worry about oh john she said what an awful thing to do i know i know he said but he wasn t listening look he said excitedly some of them have been born al ready he lifted some of the baby rats out of the box and looked at them through a magnifying glass oh dear he said at last sadly perhaps there is a prob lem look mary looked through the magnifying glass she began to feel ill there was a long silence there certainly is a problem mary s voice sounded loud and high in the quiet room she stared at the small animals under the magnifying glass baby rats with no eyes no ears six leqs oh john john what have you done he looked at her strangely it s awful isn t it but i had to know and remember mary their mothers have had five parts per million of these chemicals in their drinking water for two weeks that s a lot much much more than we re putting in the river mary looked away from the rats she remembered the beau tiful afternoon that they had spent with john s children sail ing on the clear blue water john these waste products are dangerous she said we ve got to stop putting them in the river of course of course john put his hand on her arm to comfort her but it was the same hand the hand that had held the rats of course we ll stop it if we need to mary the company can build machines to clean the waste products i ll start my report for david wilson next week but she turned round to face him his hand fell from her arm don t you think we should stop making the paint now john perhaps it ll take years to build those machines and we re putting the chemicals into the river right now a shadow crossed his face his eyes looked at hers then away out of the window i don t think we need to do that now mary we re putting very little into the river at the moment and the com pany will build those machines won t they she remembered her long years of work the hundreds of unsuccessful experiments she touched his hand and smiled i hope so john she said i really hope so she turned and went quickly out of the room the report john s report took longer than he had thought it was nearly six weeks later when he went to discuss the re suits with david wilson mr wilson wasn t a scientist he was a businessman he knew how to run a business how to make money thanks for coming john david wilson came out from behind his desk and shook hands with john they sat in two big comfortable armchairs by the window david wilson s office was large with a thick carpet and beautiful pictures on the walls from the window john could see the river and the woods and fields on the other side he felt comfortable happy safe i ve read your report wilson began then he stopped and lit a cigarette not very good is it what john stared at him in surprise wilson smiled and moved his hand through the clouds of smoke no no don t worry i don t mean the report is bad of course not you ve worked very hard and done your job well what i mean is i don t like the ideas at the end of the report what s wrong with them they re too expensive the two men stared at each other for a moment and john felt cold and sick in his stomach wilson smiled but it wasn t the kind of smile that john liked look john he said your report says that we should build some new machines to clean up the waste products before they go into the river right and those machines will cost two million pounds where do you think we can find all that money doesn t grow on trees you know no of course not john s mouth was dry he took a drink of water and felt his hand shaking but we re selling a lot of the new paint we re making millions of pounds every month from that aren t we we re doing very well yes said wilson but if we spend two million pounds to build these new machines the paint will have to cost more and we won t sell so much but we ve got to do it said john these waste prod ucts are much more dangerous than i d thought didn t you read that in my report when i put the chemicals in rats drinking water some of the baby rats were born without eyes and ears one didn t have any legs and one had six he shivered and some were born without legs when they drank only two parts per million we can t put those chemicals in the river of course i read that john i read your report very care fully indeed and your report also says that on most days we put less than two parts per million into the river no wait listen to me for a minute we both know that no drinking wa ter comes out of this part of the river don t we and in two kilometres the river goes out into the sea so why is it danger ous nobody is ever going to drink it john we don t need to build these new machines john thought of his children sailing on the river in their boat he thought of the seals and people fishing and little children playing on the beach and swimming we ve got to build them he said david wilson looked at him carefully his voice when he spoke was very quiet and hard listen to me john you re a very good scientist and we re lucky to have you in this com pany but you re not a businessman and i am look at this he picked up a sheet of paper and held it across the table for john to see it showed how much money the compa ny had we borrowed ten million pounds last year and we employed four hundred more people think how much that means to a small town like this i know said john but just a minute listen to me if we build these cleaning machines of yours people will lose their jobs a lot of people this company can t afford to borrow any more money john we just can t do it john stood up and what happens if people get ill because of this have you thought of that what will the newspapers say then no one will get ill because no one drinks that water john the newspapers will never know about it they will if i tell them there was a long silence then david wilson stood up he walked past john duncan without looking at him and sat down behind his desk when he looked up his eyes were cold and grey like stones from the beach if you do that john i shall say you re a liar you ll lose your job you ll have to sell your house and go back to living in a nasty little flat you ll never get another job and you ll never have a house or any money again you ll just be an old man walking the streets without friends or money is that what you want john didn t answer he stood for a long time and stared at david wilson and didn t say a word after nearly two min utes wilson smiled a thin quiet smile but if you stay with us you will be paid twice as much next year and no one will ever be hurt because no one will ever drink that water he got up from his desk came round to the front and held out his hand john stood still for a long moment then he shook hands think about it john said david wilson john duncan turned and walked slowly towards the door christine and simon mary talked to mr wilson too but it was no good she came out looking tired and very sad for many months she argued with david wilson about the danger of the waste products but he would not listen to her and so eighteen months after john s report mary decided to move to another company she was pleased because it was a more important job but that wasn t the reason she was going she knew that the cleaning machines would never be built john was sad to see her go he had enjoyed working with her and she had come to his house several times over the last year and a half his children liked her now they had never been so friendly with any woman since their mother had died on her last day mary and john had lunch in the factory restaurant together you don t have to go you know mary john said this company is very successful and it s growing all the time your new paint has meant four hundred new jobs all because of your discovery this isn t a poor town any more it s becoming successful rich people will want to move here from other places he talked about the new sports centre at andrew s school which was built with money from the paint company there were two big new shops in the town as well and a new the atre and a lot of new houses and it s all because of you he said it s wonderful mary don t you think he smiled at her across the table and took her hand in his she looked at him quietly he had changed a lot since he had first started working at the factory for the first six months after he had got the job he had been really happy and lively she had always known where he was in the factory because he was always laughing or singing to himself but for the last eighteen months he had been much quieter he was always busy but he didn t sing or laugh and he didn t often look mary in the eyes and when he was alone he looked tired and sad she took her hand away from his gently you know why i m going john she said i know what s going into the river and i don t like to think about it you should leave too and get a job in another company i m too old john stared at her angrily it isn t easy for me to get a new job and mary the company has been mak ing the paint for more than two years now and no one s been hurt have they mary didn t answer for a moment then she said only you what do you mean only me she looked at him sadly his head was bald now and he was beginning to look like an old man once she had wanted to marry him now she was pleased that he hadn t asked her oh i just meant your leg of course john still had a painful red place on his leg and sometimes he walked badly because of it but that wasn t what mary meant john smiled my leg s nearly better i d almost forgotten about it but mary before you go i wonder if you could help me it s a family matter i see well how can i help i don t know your children very well you know no of course not but you re a woman and well it s sometimes difficult for me as a father on my own christine s a young woman now and she hasn t got a mother to discuss things with i don t always know what to say no mary looked at him sadly she often wondered why he didn t ask her to his house more often she liked him and his children and she thought he liked her how old is chris tine now eighteem and she wants to get married already she s rather young isn t she john looked unhappy well that s what i say but she gets so angry with me mary really angry who s the young man he s called simon macdonald he s a journalist he works for the local newspaper he s a nice young man i sup pose but every time i speak to him we argue and then christine always agrees with him and i get angry with her too i don t want to mary but i do i feel i m losing her you see what do you argue about oh i don t know stupid things really he belongs to one of these environmental groups greenworld i think and he s always talking about it he thinks only young people are right and everyone over twenty five is always wrong mary looked at john thoughtfully well what do you want me to do john i m not a moth er and i ve never been married no but you could talk to christine perhaps if you came to our house for sunday lunch so mary went to john s house simon was there too they had a meal and talked about horses and sailing everyone was polite and there were no arguments later mary went with christine to look at her horse and simon stayed with john in the field mary began to talk about simon he s fine young man christine he s very clever and kind he makes me think of your father my father he s nothing like my father and dad hates him i m sure he doesn t he does he says he s too old for me and i mustn t see him he thinks i m still a little girl mary but i m eighteen i want to get married tell me more about simon and so for a long time mary stood in the quiet lonely field she helped christine give food to her horse and listened to her talk about simon simon christine said was kind intelli gent very hard working he liked sailing and riding and he wanted to make the world a cleaner better place he made her feel important like an adult not a child any more she had met his parents and they liked her a lot it was only her father so what should i do mary christineasked mary put her hand on the horse s neck i m not sure she said i think you should marry him but you don t want to make your father angry do you that s not the best way to start your life with simon no but i will if i have to would you like me to talk to him perhaps he ll listen to me it s difficult for him you re his only daughter and he s probably very worried about it oh would you mary please i want dad to like simon really but he s always nasty to him i ll do my best my dear but i don t know if it ll work mary did try very hard before she moved to scotland for her new job she spoke to john on the phone and sometimes they had a cup of coffee together in town she was surprised how carefully john listened to her and how grateful he seemed write a full page article every week on the environment and this is the first one look here he pulled a page of newspaper out of his pocket and held it up in front of them there were pictures of water sandbanks and some seals the headline read seals at river mouth have strange disease four baby seals found dead the wedding day the disease among the seals got worse three more baby seals died and one was born without a tall scientists came from london to look at them and there were long arti cles in the newspapers but no one was sure what the reasons were some people said that it was a disease that was always in the water some people said the seals were eating diseased fish and some people said that it was the paint factory near the river there was a sewage works near the river too the sewage from another small town came to it one day in the factory john duncan found two young chemists testing samples of wa ter from the river the water came from two kilometres up stream near the sewage works why are you doing that he asked surprised it s a special experiment one of them answered david wilson asked us to do it himself didn t he tell you sir john didn t answer he watched them quietly for several minutes what are the results he asked they re bad sir said the young man but he didn t look worried he looked pleased proud of himself that sewage works is putting a lot of nasty things into the river you know i think the newspapers will be very interested the newspapers john asked the young man smiled yes mr duncan of course our company cares about the environment doesn t it that s why we re doing this we want to help those poor seals if we can as john walked away he listened for the sound of quiet laughter behind him but he heard nothing perhaps the young man really believed what he said christine and simon were married on a fine day in june when they came back from the church they had a party in the gar den at john s house everyone seemed very happy john liked simon s parents and talked to them a lot you re very lucky mr duncan simon s father said you have a beautiful house with a lovely river at the end of the garden i haven t always been lucky john answered people used to say i was a very unlucky man he stood still think ing he remembered how unhappy he had been in the little flat in the middle of the town he had been unemployed then with no money to buy good things for his children but he had always been able to talk to them now he was a rich man a success and his children didn t want to talk to him he smiled at mr and mrs macdonald yes he said i m a very lucky man i have simon for my son in law i m very pleased for my daughter mrs macdonald was pleased we re very pleased to have christine for our daughter in law too she said and i m sure simon will help you with this river mr duncan i under stand there s a disease in it which is making the seals ill simon told me he s going to work very hard to find the reason for that and clean up the river i m sure you re pleased about that mr duncan yes of course john had seen simon s article in the newspaper last night about the diseases that came from the sewage works david wilson had shown it to him john didn t want to talk about it he saw his daughter laughing with simon andrew and some friends he had never seen her look so happy he re membered his own wedding and the hopes he and rachel had had let me get you another drink mrs macdonald he said we must drink to our children s future and wish them luck at the bar in the house he met mary she came back to the town sometimes and twice he had visited her in scotland this day s been a great success john she said you must be a happy man he touched her arm thoughtfully i d like to be mary he said i ve tried you know i ve done my best but it s their world now they must do what they can with it i don t believe you it s not true christine simon s information is wrong i don t believe you father john and christine stared at each other angrily it was a miserable frightening moment for them both it was a night three months after the wedding and christine had come with some happy news she had come to tell her father that she was going to have a baby his first grandchild for a while they had talked about that but then christine had begun to talk about simon s new job simon had found some information about the waste products from the paint factory his informa tion was dangerous for the company simon had written an ar ticle in the newspaper saying that waste products from the paint factory could be killing the baby seals david wilson had written to the newspaper immediately saying that simon s article was completely untrue and so instead of talking happily about the baby christine and her father had argued all evening john had known for a long time that they would have this argument and next week in the town there would be a public enquiry when govern ment officials would try to discover the truth scientists and lawyers would speak on both sides of the argument everyone in the town was talking about the enquiry and about simon s newspaper article why did david wilson write to the paper father chris tine asked he s not a scientist he s just a businessman why didn t you write to the paper i have written to the paper said john sadly you ll probably read my letter tomorrow oh what did you say christine asked john felt sad he hadn t wanted to write the letter he and david wilson had had a big argument about it but in the end he had agreed he had agreed to hide many bad things before so one more didn t make any difference i said that our waste products don t make the river water dangerous we ve tested them very carefully for many years and if they are diluted in water they are not dangerous at all there are usually only one and a half parts per million in the river water that s all and the seals aren t in the river they re out at sea i wrote that in my letter and i ll say the same thing at the enquiry next week christine was watching him carefully as he spoke she saw how tired and sad his face was he was looking at his hands most of the time not at her father i want to believe you but i can t she said soft ly he looked up don t then he said angrily you believe simon if you want to he s a journalist after all i m only a biologist and your father why should you believe me he stood up angrily walked to the door and opened it i m sor ry christine i ve had a hard day i m tired and i don t want to sit here listening to my daughter telling me i m a liar go home to simon i m going to bed she got up slowly it s important father she said slowly it s important for everyone i know it is christine but the paint factory s important too it s given a lot to you and me and to the people of this town try to remember that and forget about the seals for a while can t you there are more important things than money father are there you tell that to all the people who work in the company and live in this town what are they going to live on when the factory s closed because of simon s stupid arti cles can they give their children photographs of baby seals to eat christine looked at him for a long moment before she went out of the door and what about children who play by the river father what if they drink the river water what then nobody drinks water from that part of the river he said and i ve told you it isn t dangerous to children christine closed the door quietly behind her greenworld two days ater christine and simon arrived at john s house it was very early five o clock in the morning and they didn t knock at the door or try to wake anyone up in fact john wasn t there christine knew he had gone to scotland to see mary he was coming back on the morning of the enquiry christine and simon walked quietly down to the boathouse by the river without talking they put the boat in the water and sailed away across the river on the other side of the river they met two friends peter and susan their friends were wearing white clothes with greenworld written on them simon and christine also put on white clothes then they all got into the boat and sailed up stream towards the paint factory it was a windy morning and the waves on the river were quite big but christine was a good sailor and in about half an hour they reached the factory two photographers stood by the river taking photos of them ok simon where is it shouted christine over there look in front of that post he said chris tine sailed the boat towards the post when they were near it they could see under the water it was the pipe that took the waste products out of the factory ok here shouted simon christine turned the boat to wards the wind and susan caught hold of the post then simon and peter climbed out of the boat into the water the water was moving fast here and they had to hold onto the pipe and the boat peter then took several strong paper bags out of the boat the bags were small but very heavy be cause they were filled with building cement peter passed the bags one at a time to simon and simon went down under the water and pushed each bag into the pipe a few minutes later the mouth of the pipe was full of bags of cement simon came up out of the water for the last time it s ok he shouted we ve done it the cement is wet already and in a few hours it ll be as hard as a rock nothing can come out of that pipe now the two men climbed back in to the boat and smiled at the photographers then simon stood up in the boat with christine and held up a long white sheet on the sheet was written greenworld this pipe kills seals at that moment two things happened a man ran out of the factory shouting angrily and the wind suddenly became stronger it caught the sail and sent it quickly from one side of the boat to the other the back of the sail hit christine hard on the back of the head she fell into the water like a bag of potatoes then the wind caught the sail again and threw it back across the boat this time the boat fell over on its side and lay with its sail under the water simon was under the sail the sail and the sheet were all around him and for several seconds he could see nothing then he came up into the air he saw a foot kicking hard in the water beside him someone was moving under the sail quickly he went down under the water again and tried to help peter but peter caught hold of simon and pulled him under water too there was a quick frightening fight and then simon managed to pull them both up into the air again they held onto the side of the boat together breathing deeply simon saw susan holding onto the back of the boat then he heard someone shouting he looked behind him and saw the man from the factory he was shouting and pointing down stream but simon had water in his ears and at first he couldn t hear the words very well then he understood look the man said the girl she s drowning simon looked downstream where the man was pointing he saw something white floating far away it was not doing anything just floating round and round like a bag of old clothes on the water christine the river was taking her quickly downstream towards the sea hurriedly simon began to swim after her he was a good swimmer but the white clothes slowed him down he swam as fast as he could but he seemed to go slowly so slowly the water seemed heavy and held him back for the rest of his life he would dream about that long slow swim towards a white body that floated quickly away in front of him at last he reached christine she was floating with her face down unconscious he tried to turn her over but it was so difficult she was heavy and her arms fell back in the water when he dropped them he got her face out of the water but her head fell backwards lifeless and she was not breathing he caught hold of her face then put his mouth over hers and blew into it he rested and then blew into her mouth again and again nothing happened he looked around him they were in the middle of the river moving quickly downstream here it was about twenty five metres to the bank but about two hundred metres downstream a second river came in from the left the bank was further away there and the water moved faster simon was tired and afraid it had rained last night and there was a lot of water moving downstream to the sea the strong wind blew little waves into his face he began to swim on his back pulling christine towards the trees on the bank he swam for half a minute then stopped and blew four times into her mouth once he thought he saw her breathe but he couldn t be sure her face was very white and he had no idea if her heart was beating the river was taking them quickly to the sea he swam harder kicking strongly with his legs nearer only five metres to go now but the bank was moving past very quickly there was a tree near the bank its branches were low over the water simon kicked hard caught the branch and held onto it the water tried to pull him away he took a deep breath and blew strongly into christine s mouth again and this time he was sure she took a breath by herself afterwards it took him nearly five minutes to pull her on to the bank when they got there he put her on the ground breathed into her mouth again and then felt for her heart at first he couldn t find it his hands were too cold then yes it was beating for another five minutes he helped her breathe until he was sure she could do it by herself then he began to shiver the wind made his wet clothes cold on his body he wondered what to do then he looked down and saw that christine s eyes were open chris he said are you all right she said something but very quietly and he could not hear it he lay down and put his arms around her to keep her warm he could feel her heart beating and her body breath ing under him simon began to cry the public enquiry two days later the enquiry began scientists came from london to ask questions about the disease that was killing the seals before he had gone to scotland john had been to see david wilson about the enquiry david wilson had asked john to speak for the company you re our chief biologist john he said you re an im portant man they ll believe you john said nothing he didn t want to speak at the enquiry but he knew he had to david wilson smiled or at least his mouth smiled but his eyes watched john carefully all the time like the cold eyes of a fish think carefully about what you say john if you say the wrong thing next week hundreds of people will lose their jobs and the first person to lose his job will be you john i promise you that the enquiry room was crowded there were a lot of journal ists and photographers there and a lot of people from the town and the factory too john s train was late and he caught a taxi from the station when he came into the room he saw simon sitting with the journalists christine was near him with andrew and some young people from greenworld john smiled at her but she didn t smile back she looks very white and ill he thought it s probably the baby he remembered how ill his wife rachel had been in the mornings before christine was born and he smiled sadly to himself mr john duncan please he walked to the front of the room as he sat down he saw david wilson s cold grey eyes watching him from the other side of the room that man should be up here instead he thought he should tell his own lies a lawyer began to ask him questions at first it was easy john explained how long he had worked for the company and how much paint the factory produced then the lawyer asked about the waste products these are very dangerous chemicals aren t they the lawyer said well yes of course john answered most chemicals are dangerous if people aren t careful with them but we re very careful with them in our factory everyone wears special cloth ing we haven t had a single serious accident in three years i m pleased to hear it said the lawyer but what hap pens outside the factory do you really put these very danger ous chemicals into the river yes we do said john there was a noise in the room someone near christine shouted something angrily and a po licewoman told him to be quiet john went on of course we put these chemicals in the river but we don t put a lot in only two or three hundred litres every day that s not much and we check the river all the time three times every day there are usually only two parts per million or less in the water near the factory and there is much less downstream that s not dangerous not dangerous mr duncan said the lawyer slowly are you sure yes i am john said he looked up at the hundreds of eyes watching him david wilson s eyes christine s eyes simon s i understand the lawyer said slowly that there has been an experiment with some rats some mother rats were given these chemicals in their drinking water and some of their babies were born without legs is that right mr duncan john looked at the lawyer for the first time he was a small uninteresting looking man in grey clothes with grey hair and a thin face he looks like a rat himself john thought the man s eyes were small and bright and for some strange reason he had a newspaper in his hand john began to feel afraid of him yes he said that s right but rats are much smaller than people and they were given nearly five parts per million in their drinking water for ten days that s very different no one drinks the river water it goes straight out to sea he looked at the lawyer and waited for the question about the seals but it didn t come instead the lawyer said so you won t be worried mr duncan if someone falls into the river by accident and drinks a lot of river water your own daughter for example there s no danger in an accident like that is that right john looked at christine across the room how big her eyes look in that white face he thought it must be because of the baby no he said there s no danger at all there was the sound of voices in the room the lawyer smiled a small rat like smile he held his newspaper out to wards john you ve been away in scotland mr duncan he said have you seen this as john read the newspaper his hands began to shake and he had to hold the side of the table there was a picture of christine standing up in a boat near the factory and another picture of her lying in an ambulance with simon beside her the headline said biologist s daughter nearly drowns in river there was a long silence he tried to read the newspaper carefully but there was something wrong with his eyes and his head was full of pictures of christine in the river drowning and his wife rachel drowning in the storm long ago he shook his head quickly from side to side then took his glasses off and cleaned them no he said in a quiet voice i haven t read this before it s all right mr duncan said the lawyer softly your daughter is safe her husband saved her and she hasn t lost her baby but she did drink a lot of river water it was near the factory too you re not worried about that are you the lawyer s bright eyes were staring at him like a rat that has just seen its food behind him david wilson suddenly stood up that is a terrible question he shouted into the silence you can t ask a man questions like that of course he s wor ried about his daughter you must stop this enquiry at once just a minute mr wilson said the lawyer mr duncan can go in a minute he just has to answer one question are you worried because your daughter has drunk so much river water mr duncan are you worried about her baby john duncan stared at the lawyer with fear in his eyes sud denly he hated him he picked up the newspaper and threw it into the little man s rat like face yes he shouted wildly yes yes yes of course i m worried about the baby of course it s dangerous now let me go he ran down the room out of the door into the street a hundred staring eyes watched him go the future six months later john duncan was living in a small flat near the sea he had lost his job and had had to sell his expensive house he couldn t afford the payments on it from a window in his flat he could look at the sea he sat and looked at the cold grey sea for hours every day christine would have her baby soon he had bought lots of baby clothes to give her his bedroom was full of baby clothes little pink coats and trousers for a girl blue ones for a boy there were little soft toys too teddy bears and small animals with blue empty eyes but he hadn t given any of these things to her because she wouldn t talk to him when he went to see her she closed the door in his face when he rang she put the phone down when he wrote she sent the letters back unopened there were a lot of books and magazines in his bedroom too but he kept them under his bed he read them sometimes at night but he didn t like to see them during the day they were about babies and the diseases that babies could get be fore they were born there were some terrible things in the books terrible pictures he didn t like to think about them but he couldn t stop he thought about them all day all the time today as he sat staring out of the window at the sea he could not stop his hands shaking every morning he rang the hospital to ask if his daughter christine macdonald was there he had rung this morning and a nurse had said yes christine was there and the baby was coming that had been four hours ago for two hours john had sat by the telephone afraid to ring the hospital again three times he had picked it up and three times he had put it down again he picked it up again and rang the number seven five eight three it was no good he put the phone down again he could not hear the news from the cold voice of a nurse over the telephone he had to see the baby for himself he got up put on his coat and went downstairs there was a cold wind outside blowing from the sea the sea and the sky were grey and miserable he went into a shop and bought some flowers he chose them carefully bright red and yellow colours and the shopkeeper put paper around them to keep them safe john took them and walked quickly nervously along the windy road by the sea towards the hos pital it was raining out at sea already the rain was falling on the sandbanks where the seals used to live soon it would be falling on the town john duncan shivered and turned his coat collar up then with his bright flowers in his hand he walked on into the winter wind the rassendylls and the elphbergs i wonder when you re going to do something useful rudolf my brother s wife said she looked at me crossly over the breakfast table but why should i do anything rose i answered calmly eating my egg i ve got nearly enough money for the things i want and my brother robert is a lord lord burlesdon i m very happy you re twenty nine and you ve done nothing except play about it s true we rassendylls are a rich and famous family and we don t need to do anything this made rose angry rich and famous families usually behave worse than less important families she said when i heard this i touched my dark red hair i knew what she meant i m so pleased that robert s hair is black she cried just then my brother robert came in when he looked at rose he could see that there was something wrong what s the matter my dear he said oh she s angry because i never do anything useful and because i ve got red hair i said well i know he can t do much about his hair or his nose rose began no the nose and the hair are in the family my brother agreed and rudolf has both of them in the room there were many family pictures and one of them was of a very beautiful woman lady amelia who lived a hundred and fifty years ago i stood up and turned to look at it if you took that picture away robert rose cried we could forget all about it oh but i don t want to forget about it i replied i like being an elphberg but perhaps i should stop for a moment and explain why rose was angry about my nose and my hair and why i a rassendyll said i was an elphberg after all the elphbergs are the royal family of ruritania and have been for hundreds of years the story is told in a book about the rassendyll family history in the year prince rudolf of ruritania came to england on a visit and he stayed for several months like many of the elphberg royal family he had blue eyes an unusually long straight nose and a lot of dark red hair he was also tall and very good looking during his stay here he became friendly with lady amelia the beautiful wife of lord burlesdon they became very good friends indeed which naturally did not please lord burlesdon so one cold wet morning the two men fought the prince was hurt in the fight but got better and was hurried back to ruritania there he married and became king rudolf the third but lord burlesdon fell ill and six months later he died two months after that lady amelia had a baby son who became the next lord burlesdon and the head of the rassendyll family the boy grew into a man with blue eyes a long straight nose and dark red hair these things can happen in the best of families and among the many pictures of the rassendylls at home you can see that five or six of them have the same blue eyes the same nose and the same red hair so because my hair was red and i had the elphberg nose rose worried about me in the end to please her i promised to get a job in six months time this gave me six free months to enjoy myself first and an idea came to me i would visit ruritania none of my family had ever been there they preferred to forget all about the lady amelia but i saw in the newspaper that in three weeks the new young king rudolf the fifth would have his coronation it would be an interesting time to visit the country i knew my family would not like my going so i told them i was going walking in austria the colour of men s hair on the way to ruritania i decided to spend a night in paris with a friend the next morning he came with me to the station and as we waited for the train we watched the crowds we noticed a tall dark very fashionable lady and my friend told me who she was that s madame antoinette de mauban she s travelling on the same train as you but don t fall in love with her why not i asked amused ah said my friend all paris knows that she s in love with duke michael of strelsau and he as you know is the half brother of the new king of ruritania although he s only the second son and will never be king himself he s still an important man and very popular i hear with many ruritanians the lovely madame antoinette won t look twice at you rudolf i laughed but he had woken my interest in the lady i did not speak to her during the journey and when we arrived in ruritania i left the train at zenda a small town outside the capital but i noticed that madame de mauban went on to strelsau the capital i was welcomed very kindly at my hotel it belonged to a fat old lady and her pretty daughter from them i learned that the coronation was to be on the day after next and not in three weeks the old lady was more interested in duke michael of strelsau than in the new king the castle of zenda and all the land around it belonged to the duke but the old lady said it s not enough duke michael should be king he spends all his time with us every ruritanian knows him but we never see the new king but the daughter cried oh no i hate black michael i want a red elphberg and the king our friend johann says is very red johann works for the duke and he s seen the king in fact the king s staying just outside zenda now she added he s resting at the duke s house in the forest before going on to strelsau on wednesday for his coronation the duke s already in strelsau getting everything ready they re friends i asked friends who want the same place and the same wife the pretty girl replied the duke wants to marry his cousin princess flavia but people say she s going to be king rudolf s wife and the queen just then their friend johann entered the room we have a visitor johann the girl s mother said and johann turned towards me but when he saw me he stepped back with a look of wonder on his face what s the matter johann the daughter asked good evening sir johann said still staring at me he did not seem to like what he saw the girl began to laugh it s the colour of your hair sir she explained we don t often see that colour here it s the elphberg red not johann s favourite colour the next day i decided to walk through the forest for a few miles and take the train to strelsau from a little station along the road i sent my luggage on by train and after lunch i started out on foot first i wanted to see the castle of zenda and in half an hour i had climbed the hill to it there were two buildings the old one with a moat around it and the new modern building duke michael could have friends to stay with him in the new castle but he could go into the old castle when he wanted to be alone the water in the moat was deep and if he pulled up the drawbridge over the moat no one could get to him i stayed there for some time and looked at the castle and then i walked on through the forest for about an hour it was beautiful and i sat down to enjoy it before i knew what had happened i was asleep suddenly i heard a voice say good heavens he looks just like the king when i opened my eyes there were two men in front of me one of them came nearer may i ask your name he said well why don t you tell me your names first i replied the younger of the two men said this is captain sapt and i am fritz von tarlenheim we work for the king of ruritania and i am rudolf rassendyll i answered a traveller from england my brother is lord burlesdon of course the hair sapt cried you know the story fritz just then a voice called out from the trees behind us fritz fritz where are you man it s the king fritz said and sapt laughed then a young man jumped out from behind a tree i gave a cry and when he saw me he stepped back in sudden surprise the king of ruritania looked just like rudolf rassendyll and rudolf rassendyll looked just like the king for a moment the king said nothing but then he asked captain fritz who is this sapt went to the king and spoke quietly in his ear the king s surprise changed slowly to an amused smile then suddenly he began to laugh loudly well met cousin he cried where are you travelling to to strelsau sirto the coronation the king looked at his friends and for a moment he was serious but then he began to laugh again wait until brother michael sees that there are two of us he cried perhaps it isn t a very good idea for mr rassendyll to go to strelsau fritz said worried and sapt agreed with him oh we ll think about the coronation tomorrow the kingsaid tonight we ll enjoy ourselves come cousin we returned to the duke s house in the forest where we had an excellent dinner the king called loudly for wine and captain sapt and fritz seemed worried clearly the king liked his wine a little too much remember the coronation is tomorrow warned old sapt but the king was only interested in enjoying himself tonight so we all drank and talked and drank again at last the king put down his glass and said i ve drunk enough as he said that old josef the king s servant came in he put some very special old wine on the table in front of the king and said duke michael offers you this wine and asks you to drink it for love of him well done black michael the king cried well i m not afraid to drink your wine and he drank every drop of wine in the bottle himself then his head fell forward on to the table and soon afterwards i too remembered no more of that wild evening the king goes to his coronation i do not know how long i was asleep but when i woken i was cold and wet sapt and fritz stood there looking at me we had to wake you sapt said gold water was the only way fritz took my arm and turned me round look he said the king was on the floor and when sapt pushed him with his foot he did not move we ve been trying to wake him for half an hour said fritz but he s sleeping like a dead man the three of us looked at each other was there something in that last bottle of wine i asked i don t know sapt said but if be doesn t get to his coronation today there ll never be a coronation for him all ruritania is waiting for him in strelsau and black michael with half the army too we can t tell them that the king is too drunk to go to his own coronation you can say he s ill i said ill sapt laughed angrily everybody will know what that means he s been ill too many times before tell me do you think somebody put something in his wine i asked it was black michael fritz replied we all know he wants to be king himself for a moment or two we were all silent and then sapt looked at me you must go to strelsau and take his place i stared at him you re crazy man how can i do that the king it s dangerous i know said sapt but it s our only chance if you don t go black michael will be king and the real king will be dead or a prisoner how could i refuse it took me two minutes to decide i ll go i said well done boy cried sapt he went on quickly and quietly after the coronation they ll take us to the palace for the night when we re alone you and i will leave and ride back here to fetch the king he ll be all right by then i ll take him back to strelsau and you must get out of the country as fast as you can but what about the soldiers fritz asked they re duke michael s men and they re coming to take the king back to strelsau for the coronation we ll go before the soldiers get here sapt said and we ll hide the king he picked up the king in his arms and we opened the door an old woman johann s mother was standing there she turned without a word and went back to the kitchen did she hear fritz asked don t worry i ll make sure she can t talk sapt said and he carried the king away when he returned he told us that he had locked the old woman in a room underground the king and josef were hidden in another room underground josef will take care of the king and tell him everything when he wakes up come he went on there s no time to lose it s already six o clock soon i was dressed in the king s clothes the horses were ready and we were on our way as we rode through the forest sapt told me everything that he could about my life my family my friends and the things i liked or did not like he told me what to do when we got there and how to speak to different people he was a wonderful teacher and i listened hard one mistake could mean death for all three of us it was eight o clock when we arrived at the station and got on the train and by halfpast nine we were in strelsau and when king rudolf the fifth stepped out of the train the people shouted god save the king old sapt smiled god save them both he said quietly i only hope we are all alive tonight my adventures begin as we made our way to the palace i began to feel that i really was the king of ruritania with marshal strakencz the head of the army on my right and old sapt on my left i could see that strelsau was really two towns the old town and the new town the people of the old town who were poor wanted duke michael to be their king but the people of the new town wanted king rudolf we went through the new town first and it was bright and colourful with the ladies dresses and the red roses of the elphbergs the people shouted loudly for their king as we passed through the streets but when we came to the old town the marshal and sapt moved nearer to my horse and i could see that they were afraid for me stay back i called i ll show my people that i m not afraid of them some of the crowd were pleased when they heard this but most of them watched me in silence finally we reached the great church of strelsau i remember very little of the coronation only two faces one was a beauti ful girl with wonderful red hair the princess flavia the other was the face of a man with black hair and dark deep eyes black michael when he saw me his face turned white clearly he was surprised and deeply unhappy to see me the coronation seemed to last for hours but i managed to say and do all the right things at last it was over and i was now the king of ruritania as princess flavia and i drove back to the palace in an open car one man in the crowd called out when s the wedding the princess s face went a little pink when she heard this after a while she said you seem different today rudolf quieter and more serious are you going to become a more sensible person now the princess i realized did not think very highly of the king as for me i thought the king was a very lucky man if that will please you i ll try to do it i said softly the princess s face went pink again then she said you must be careful of michael you know i know i said that he wants what i have and also what i hope to have one day as i spoke i looked at her and she smiled at me prettily i wonder what the king s doing now i thought the royal dinner went on for a long time but at last fritz sapt and i were alone in the king s dressing room you did well fritz said but rassendyll be careful black michael looked blacker than ever today because you and the princess had so much to say to each other she s very beautiful i replied come on sapt cried there s no time for that now we must leave for zenda at once to find the king if we re caught we ll all be killed black michael has had a letter from zenda so perhaps he knows already don t unlock the door fritz while we re away or you ll be a dead man say the king must be left alone to rest now come on the horses are ready fritz and i shook hands then i covered my red hair and most of my face sapt and i left the room by a secret door and we found ourselves outside at the back of the palace gardens a man was waiting there with two horses soon we left the town behind us and we were out in the country we rode like the wind and by ten o clock had come to the edge of the forest of zenda suddenly sapt stopped listen he said quietly horses behind us quick get down the castle s to the left he continued our road s to the right we hid in the thick trees and we waited and watched the men came nearer it was black michael and another man when they came to the two roads they stopped which way the duke asked to the castle the other man cried they ll know there what s been happening the duke waited for a moment to zenda then he cried finally and the two men took the road to the left we waited for ten more minutes and then we hurried on when we arrived at the house in the forest we ran to the underground rooms the one where sapt had locked up the old woman was empty she had escaped the other room was locked sapt s face was white with fear between us we broke down the door and ran in i found a light and looked round the room the servant josef was on the floor dead i held up the light and looked in every corner of the room the king isn t herer i said his majesty returns to strelsau it was one o clock in the morning for a few minutes we said nothing then sapt cried the duke s men have taken the king prisoner then we must get back and wake everyone in strelsau i cried we must catch black michael before he kills the king who knows where the king is now sapt answered then suddenly he began to laugh but we ve given black michael a problem he said yes my boy we ll go back to strelsau the king will be in his palace in strelsau again tomorrow no i cried yes sapt answered it s the only way to help him go back and take his place for him but the duke knows yes but he can t speak can he what can he say this man isn t the king because i ve taken the real king prisoner and murdered his servant can he say that but people will soon realize l m not the real king i said perhaps perhaps not said sapt but we must have a king in strelsau or michael will ride in tomorrow as the new king listen boy if you don t go back to strelsau they ll kill the king and if you do go back they can t kill the king because if they kill him how can they ever say that you re not the real king don t you see he cried it s a dangerous game but it gives us a chance of winning it was a wild hopeless plan but i was young i would never have the chance of an adventure like this again sapt i ll try it i said good for you sapt cried but we must hurry look he pulled me over to the door the moon was low now and there was not much light but i could just see a small group of men on horses they were black michael s men probably coming to take the dead body of josef away we can t let them go without doing something i said thinking of poor josef right sapt agreed we ran out of the back of the house and quickly got onto our horses silently we waited in the darkness and then we galloped round the house and straight into the group of men between us we killed three of them but a bullet hit my finger and it began to bleed we rode hard all night and it was about eight or nine o clock in the morning when we reached strelsau luckily the streets were still empty we arrived at the palace went in and got to the dressing room when we opened the door fritz was asleep but he woke immediately when he saw me he fell to the ground and cried thank god your majesty you re safe well done boy sapt shouted we ll do it fritz stood up he looked at me up and down down and up then he took a step backwards where s the king he cried be quiet sapt warned him someone will hear fritz s face was white now is the king dead he asked quietly please god no i answered but black michael has him the next day was a long one for me sapt talked to me for three hours about what i must do and what i must say what i liked and what i didn t like then i had to do some of the king s business but because of my damaged finger i did not have to write my name on any papers when at last i was alone with sapt and fritz we began to talk about black michael fritz told me that black michael had six very dangerous men among his servants three ruritanians a belgian a frenchman and an englishman they did anything that the duke ordered and did not stop at murder three of them the foreigners fritz had heard were in strelsau now with duke michael sapt banged the table with his hand in excitement then the king must be alive michael s brought the foreigners with him and left the three ruritanians to hold the king prisoner usually the six as they re called go everywhere with him fritz wanted to do something immediately about black michael and his men but sapt and i realized that we could not do anything openly we ll play a waiting game and let michael make the first move i said and so i continued as king of ruritania in order to help the real king i tried to make myself popular with the people i went riding through the streets smiling and talking to everybody i also went to visit the princess flavia the king s officials had told me that the princess was very popular and the people hoped that she would become my wife it was easy for me to pretend to be in love with the princess too easy those beautiful eyes and that lovely smile were stealing my heart here was my greatest danger i was pretending to be another man but losing my own heart on my first visit we sat together for a long time talking of this and that when i got up to leave princess flavia said rudolf you will be careful won t you you have enemies as i m sure you know and your life is very important to ruritania only to ruritania i asked softly and to your loving cousin she answered quietly i could not speak i took her hand in mine then with a heavy heart i left of course i made many mistakes in my new life as king but i managed to talk my way out of them with luck and with help from fritz and sapt it was like living on a knife edge once i met my brother michael in the princess s house we smiled and talked politely but i could see the anger in his black eyes an adventure with a teatable one day sapt brought me some news he had found out where the king was duke michael was holding him prisoner somewhere in the castle of zenda sapt also brought me a letter it was in a woman s handwriting to know what you most wish to know the letter began meet me tonight in the garden of the big house in new avenue come at midnight and come alone there was another note on the back of the letter ask yourself which woman does not want black michael to marry the princess a de m antoinette de mauban i cried she wants to marry the duke that s true sapt said but you won t go of course they ll kill you duke michael made her write this letter i must i replied every day we play this game there s more danger i could make a mistake at any time and if i do we ll all die don t you see i have to go tonight we can t go on much longer then i m coming too said sapt so at half past eleven that night sapt and i rode out to the house in new avenue we left fritz to watch my room in the palace the night was dark so i took a lamp i also had my revolver and a knife we soon reached the house and came to a gate in the wall i got off my horse i ll wait here said sapt if i hear anything i ll stay where you are i answered quickly it s the king s only chance they mustn t kill you too you re right said sapt good luck silently i opened the gate and went into the garden in front of me i could see the dark shape of a summer house and i moved towards it without a sound i went up the steps pushed open the door and went in a woman hurried over to me and took me by the hand i turned my lamp on her she was beautiful close the door she said we must be quick mr rassendyll michael made me write the letter three men are coming to kill you three of the six they ll tell everyone that sapt and fritz von tarlenheim murdered you then michael will make himself king and marry the princess antoinette s beautiful eyes were sad as she added softly i can t let him marry her i love him but the king i said i know he s in the castle of zenda but where go across the drawbridge and you come to a heavy door listen what s that they re coming they re too soon put out your lamp she cried her eyes filled with fear quickly you must go there s a ladder at the end of the garden against the wall but it was too late the three men were already outside there was a small hole in the door and i put my eye to it my hand was on my revolver it was no good there were three of them i could kill one perhaps but then a voice came from outside mr rassendyll it was the englishman we only want to talk to you open the door we can talk through the door i replied i looked through the hole again and saw that they were on the top step when i opened the door they would run at me we ll let you go if you leave the country and we ll give you fifty thousand english pounds continued detchard the englishman give me a minute to think i answered wildly i looked around the summer house and saw a metal garden table and some chairs i picked up the table and held it in front of me by the legs then i went to the back of the room and waited all right i agree i called open the door i heard them arguing with each other and then detchard said to the belgian why bersonin are you afraid of one man a second later the door opened de gautet the frenchman was with the other two and the three men were standing there with their revolvers ready with a shout i ran at them as hard as i could they tried to shoot me but the bullets hit the table the next second the table knocked them to the ground and we all fell on top of each other quickly i picked myself up and ran for my life through the trees i could hear them coming after me was antoinette right was there really a ladder by the wall i reached the end of the garden the ladder was there in a minute i was up it and over the wall sapt was waiting with the horses and seconds later we were on our way home and as we rode we laughed because i had fought duke michael s dangerous men with a tea table a dem for love of the king every day i was sent a secret report by the chief of police and the next afternoon i was playing cards with fritz when sapt brought it in we learned that duke michael and the three had left strelsau and that antoinette de mauban had also left clearly they had gone to zenda the report also said that the people were unhappy because the king had not yet asked princess flavia to marry him yes said fritz it s true i ve heard that the princess loves the king and she s very sad well sapt informed us i ve arranged a dance at the royal palace this evening for the princess why wasn t i told i asked angrily but sapt continued everything is arranged and tonight you must ask the princess to marry you no i ll do nothing to hurt her i cried all right my boy sapt smiled gently just say something nice to her then remember she thinks you re the king and we don t want her to be angry with him do we i understood of course if the king was saved then flavia must marry him if he was not saved then sapt would ask me to stay and marry the princess duke michael must not be king the dance was wonderful flavia was beautiful and i dancedwith her again and again everyone could feel our happiness i forgot about the crowd of rich colourful people who were watching us i had eyes only for my beautiful flavia when supper had finished fritz touched me on the shoulder i stood up took flavia s hand and led her into a little room they brought coffee to us and then the door was closed quietly the princess and i were alone the windows of the little room opened onto the garden the night was fine and the room was filled with the sweet smell of the flowers outside flavia sat down and i stood opposite her i was fighting with myself but then she looked at me and i was lost i forgot the king i forgot who i was i forgot everything i fell to my knees took her gently in my arms and kissed her suddenly she pushed me away is it true do you really love me she cried or is it because you re the king and you must marry me no i answered quietly i love you more than my life flavia smiled oh why do i love you now she said softly i didn t love you before but i do now how happy i was it was not the king she loved it was me it was rudolf rassendyll but as i looked into her lovely face i knew i could not live with the lie how could i pretend to be the king any longer there s something i must tell you i began in a low voice your majesty said a voice from the garden people are waiting to say goodbye it was sapt he had heard me talking to the princess we ll come i replied coldly but flavia her eyes full of her love for me held out her hand to sapt as he came into the room he took it and said softly and sadly god save your royal highness and then he added but before all comes the king god save the king when sapt told the people that princess flavia had accepted the king as her future husband they were wild with happiness you know sapt i said sadly i could marry the princess and let my people kill duke michael and the king i know sapt replied quietly so we must go to zenda and bring the king home atonce i said sapt put his hand on my shoulder you re the finest elph berg of them all he said with feeling before we left strelsau i saw the marshal and asked him to stay near flavia to take care of her and to keep her safe from duke michael then i went to say goodbye to her at first she was cold with me she did not understand why i wanted to leave her but her anger changed to fear when i told her that i was going after duke michael oh rudolf be careful she cried he s a dangerous man please come back safely to me duke michael can never keep me away from you i promised but in my heart i knew that another man could back to zenda the next day sapt fritz and i left strelsau to go to tarlenheim house this fine modern house belonged to fritz s uncle and was near the castle of zenda we had ten brave young men with us sapt had told them that a friend of the king s was a prisoner in the castle of zenda and that the king needed their help michael of course knew of my arrival but i was sure he did not understand why i had come he would think that my plan was to kill him and the king and marry the princess myself so i had not been in the house an hour when he sent three of the six to me these were not the three men who had tried to kill me this time he sent the three ruritanians lauengram krafstein and young rupert of hentzau duke michael is very sorry that he can t welcome you himself explained rupert of hentzau but sadly he s ill at the moment i hope that my dear brother will soon be better i replied with a smile rupert threw back his head shook his black hair and laughed he was a good looking young man people said he had broken many hearts already oh i m sure he will he answered that evening instead of having dinner at the house fritz and i went to the little hotel in the town of zenda where i had stayed before ask for a room where we can dine alone i said to fritz and ask the pretty girl to bring our food i covered my face and the girl came and put the wine down on the table when she turned to go she looked at me and i let her see my face the king she cried you were the king oh i m sorry sir i m sorry the things that we said forget that now i answered you can help me bring our dinner but tell no one that the king is here she came back in a few minutes looking very serious how s your friend johann i began she looked surprised oh we don t see him very often now she answered he s very busy at the castle but you could get johann to meet you tomorrow night couldn t you at ten o clock perhaps on the road out of zen da yes sir yon re not going to hurt him not if he does what i say go now and say nothing about this after dinner we left to go back to tarlenheim house we had almost reached it when we saw sapt running to meet us have you seen them he cried who i asked duke michael s men don t go out unless you have six men or more with you he said you know bernenstein one of your men of course i answered a good strong man about as tall as me well they tried to kill him he s upstairs now with a bullet in his arm he was walking in the woods and he saw three men suddenly they started shooting at him so he began to run he was lucky they were afraid to come too near the house so he escaped but it was you they wanted to kill sapt i said i promise i ll do one thing for ruritania be fore i leave it what s that asked sapt i ll kill every one of the six ruritania will be a better place without them news of the prisoner the next morning i was sitting in the garden in the sun when suddenly i saw young rupert of hentzau on horseback coming through the trees towards me he was not afraid of my men but asked to speak with me alone he said he had a message for me from the duke of strelsau i asked my friends to move away and rupert came and sat down near me rassendyll he began the duke don t you know how to speak to the king i asked why pretend with me because it isn t finished yet well i m here because i want to help you then give me the message what does the duke want i asked he wants you to leave he ll take you safely out of the country and give you a hundred thousand pounds i refuse i replied immediately rupert laughed i knew it he cried duke michael doesn t understand men like us you must die then he added carelessly yes i answered but you won t be alive to see me die i laughed how s your prisoner i added alive he replied how s the pretty princess i took a step towards him go now before i kill you i shouted angrily rupert turned but suddenly he came back he put out his right hand shake hands he called of course he knew what i would do i put my hands behind my back quickly his left hand moved towards me in it he held a dagger and it was coming straight at my heart i jumped to one side and the dagger went deep into my shoulder before my friends could do anything rupert of hentzau was on his horse and galloping through the trees i heard my men going after him with their guns and then everything went black when i awoke it was dark and fritz was at my bedside he told me that i was not badly hurt and that the plan to catch johann had been successful he seems pleased to be here fritz said i think he s afraid of duke michael later sapt brought johann up to see me at first johann was afraid to speak but then he began to talk we asked him many questions and finally johann gave us the information we wanted in the castle of zenda near the drawbridge and below the ground there were two small rooms cut out of the rock itself in the first of these rooms there were always three of the six at the back of this room there was a door which led into the second room the king was in the second room if someone tries to get into the first room two of the tnree men will fight but rupert of hentzau or detchard will run into the second room and kill the king johann said there s a small window in the second room with a large pipe going down into the moat outside he went on you can get a man inside it and they ll tie a heavy stone to the king s body and push it down the pipe the body will go down and disappear under the water and the murderers will then go down the pipe themselves and swim across the moat and if i bring an army to the castle i asked duke michael will still murder the king replied johann he won t fight he ll kill the king and push his body down the pipe and he ll put one of the six in the prison he ll say the man had done something to make him angry that will stop the stories about a prisoner in zenda johann stopped for a minute but then he added if they know i ve told you this they ll kill me they re all bad but rupert of hentzau is the worst don t let them kill me all right i said but if anyone asks you who the prisoner of zenda is don t tell him if you do i ll kill you myself johann left the room and i looked at sapt it doesn t matter what plan we make i said the king will be dead before we can get to him sapt shook his grey head angrily you ll still be king of ruritania in a year s time perhaps one of the duke s men will turn against him i began impossible replied sapt then we need the help of god i said a night outside the castle i wanted duke michael to think that i was still very ill so we told the newspapers that the king had had a very serious accident when princess flavia read this she was very worried and she decided to come and see me the marshal could not stop her and although i was afraid for her i was ex cited at the thought of seeing her again we spent two wonderfully happy days together we had sent johann back to the castle of zenda and suddenly we had a message from him the real king was very ill i must save him i said to myself i love flavia more each day i can t go on like this much longer i talked to sapt he agreed so we made our plans late the next night sapt fritz and i with six more men rode out towards the castle of zenda sapt was carrying a long rope and i had a short thick stick and a long knife the night was dark and it was wet and windy we stayed away from the town and we met no one when we came to the moat we stopped near some trees and the six men hid there with the horses then sapt tied the rope round one of the trees near the water i pulled off my boots put the stick between my teeth and gently went down the rope into the water i was going to take a look at the pipe it had been warm and bright that day and the water was not cold slowly and carefully i swam round the dark walls of the castle there were lights in the new buildings and from time to time i heard people shouting and laughing that must be young rupert and his friends i thought suddenly a dark shape appeared in front of me it was the pipe the bottom of it was very wide and came out into the moat and then i saw something which nearly made my heart stop it was a boat and in the boat there was a man his gun was beside him but luckily he was asleep as quietly as i could i moved closer the man still slept what could i do i had to save the king i took out my knife and drove it through the sleeping man s heart on the other side of the castle they were still singing i had very little time someone could come at any minute i looked up at where the pipe went through the wall into the prison there was a thin line of light at the bottom edge i heard detchard s voice and then i heard the king reply just then the light went out and in the darkness i heard the king crying i did not call to him i had to get away safelyand take the body of the dead watchman with me i climbed into the boat and began to go back to where my friends were no one could hear me because the wind was strong but from somewhere behind me i heard a shout someone was calling to the watchman i reached the side of the moat where sapt and fritz were waiting quickly i tied the rope round the man s body and sapt and fritz pulled it up then i climbed up the rope myself call our men from the trees i said quietly and hurry but just then three men rode round from the front of the castle luckily they did not see us but they heard our six friends riding out of the trees and with a shout they galloped towards them seconds later we heard the sound of shots and i ran to help our men sapt and fritz followed kill them cried a voice it was rupert of hentzau too late they ve got both of us cried another voice save yourself rupert i ran on holding my stick in my hand suddenly through the darkness i saw a horse coming towards me i jumped at the horse s head and saw the man s face above me at last i shouted rupert of hentzau he had only his sword and my men were coming at him from one side and sapt and fritz from the other rupert laughed it s the play actor he cried and with his sword he knocked my stick from my hand then he turned his horse galloped to the moat and jumped into the water with our bullets flying round his ears our men tried to shoot him in the water but it was dark there was no moon and we lost him we had killed two of the six lauengram and krafsteinbut i was angry three of our brave friends were also dead and we carried them home with a heavy heart and i did not like to hear rupert call me a play actor of course michael and i could not let the people know that we were enemies so in the daytime it was safe to be in the town of zenda one day soon after our night outside the castle princess flavia and i were riding through the town when we saw a group of people dressed in black going to the church rupert of hentzau was with them and when he saw us he turned his horse and came towards us it s the funeral of my dear friend lauengram he said in answer to our question i m sorry your friend is dead i said to him and i m sorry too flavia added her beautiful blue eyes sad rupert looked at her and smiled then he turned and rode away although i was angry because he had smiled at flavia i went after him you fought bravely the other night i said and you re young help me save the king and i ll help you but rupert was not interested no he answered but if they were both dead the king and the dukethen you could be king and marry your princess and i could be rich and have the woman i want antoinette de mauban i asked carelessly trying not to show my interest yes replied rupert i hate the duke she loves him not me angrily he joined the funeral group again strangely when we returned home there was a message for me from antoinette herself i helped you once help me now save me from this terrible place save me from these murderers i was sorry for her but what could i do a dangerous plan one day johann came to tell us that the king was now very sick and that antoinette de mauban and a doctor were looking after him but the duke never left rupert of hentzau alone with antoinette i understood why after what rupert had told me there were often angry voices in the castle these days johann told us two of the six were now dead but there were always two men watching the king the other two slept in a room above and would hear them if they called detchard and bersonin watched by night rupert of hentzau and de gautet by day the duke s rooms were on the first floor in the new buildings of the castle and an toinette s room was on the same floor but at night the duke locked the door of her room and pulled up the drawbridge he kept the key himself johann slept near the front door of the new castle with five other men but they had no guns we could not wait any longer listen i said to johann i ll make you rich if you do what i say johann agreed you must take this note to madame de mauban i said and tomorrow at two o clock in the morning you must open the front door of the new castle tell the others that you need air or somethingand then escape johann was clearly afraid but he seemed to understand i explained my plan to sapt and fritz when johann opens the front door i said sapt and his men will run into the castle and hold the men who are sleeping there at the same time antoinette will scream loudly again and again she ll cry help help me michael and she ll shout rupert of hentzau s name duke michael will hear and he ll run out of his roomstraight into the hands of sapt sapt will get the key from the duke and let down the draw bridge rupert and de gautet will hear the noise and hurry to cross the drawbridge i ll hide by the bridge in the moat and when they try to cross i ll kill them then we ll hurry to the room where the king is and kill detchard and bersonin before they have time to kill the king the others listened in silence it was a very dangerous plan and i did not really think it would work but we had to try that evening i went to visit flavia she seemed very thoughtful and as i was leaving she placed a ring on my finger i was wearing the king s ring but i took off my rassendyll family ring and gave it to her wear this for me always i said she kissed the ring and replied seriously i ll wear it until the day i die and then i had to leave her i had already told the marshal that if anything happened to the king he must take flavia to strelsau tell the people that duke michael had killed the king and that flavia was their queen i knew this could be my last day alive the prisoner and the king we needed bad weather but it was a fine clear night at midnight sapt fritz and their men left and rode quietly through the woods towards the castle if everything went well they would get there at a quarter to two and wait for johann to open the front door if johann did not open the door fritz would come round to the other side of the castle to find me if i was not there then i was dead and the king too sapt and his men would go back to tarlenheim house and return with the marshal and more men to get into the castle so half an hour later i too left tarlenheim i took a shorter way than sapt and when i reached the moat i hid my horse in the trees tied my rope round a strong tree and let myself down into the water slowly i began to swim along under the castle walls just after a quarter to one i came to the pipe and waited quietly in its shadow light was coming from duke michael s window opposite me across the moat and i could see into the room the next window along which johann had said was an toinette s room was dark then the duke s window opened and antoinette de mauban looked out behind her there was a man rupert of hentzau what was he doing in the duke s room i wondered rupert tried to put his arm round antoinette but she moved quickly away at that moment i heard the door of the room open and then the angry voice of duke michael what are you doing here he cried waiting for you sir rupert replied quickly i couldn t leave the lady alone well now you can go to bed are detchard and bersonin watching the prisoner yes sir a few minutes later rupert crossed the drawbridge and it was pulled up the light in duke michael s room went out but a light came on and stayed on in antoinette s room in the silent darkness i waited for about ten minutes everything was quiet but suddenly i heard a noise on my side of the moat a dark shape appeared in the gateway to the bridge then turned and began to climb down some hidden steps in the wall it was rupert of hentzau again with a sword silently he went down into the water and swam across the moat then he climbed out and i heard him unlock the door it was clear that rupert of hentzau had his own secret plans for that night it was not yet time for johann to open the front door for my friends and i still had to wait i climbed up to the gateway of the bridge and hid in a dark corner now no one could enter or leave the old castle without fighting me i wondered what rupert was doing now and a few seconds later i found out there was a sudden crash and then a woman s screams rang through the night help me michael rupert of hentzau those were the words that i had written for antoinette but these were screams of real fear and soon i heard shouts and the sound of fighting from antoinette s room then rupert appeared at the window his back was towards me but he was fighting that s for you johann i heard him cry then come on michael so johann was in there too fighting at the duke s side how could he open the door for sapt now more of the duke s men had run to the room and the noise of the fighting grew louder suddenly rupert gave a wild laugh and with his sword in his hand jumped from the window into the moat below at that moment the door of the old castle opened and de gautet appeared beside me i jumped at him with my sword and a second later he fell dead in the doorway without a word or a sound wildly i searched his body for the keys i found them and in a minute i was in the first room where bersonin and detchard were but there was only bersonin in the room before he had time to realize that i was there i had killed him detchard had run into the king s room and locked the door behind him i ran at it to break it down but would i be in time was the king already dead the king was standing helplessly by the wall but the doctor was also in the room and the brave little man had thrown himself at detchard he gave his life for the king because as i entered detchard pulled himself free and drove his sword into the doctor s side then with an angry shout detchard turned to me we fought long and hard detchard was an excellent swords man and i was growing tired he drove me back against the wall gave me a deep cut in the arm and began to smile in a second he would kill me suddenly the king realized who i was cousin rudolf he cried then he picked up a chair and threw it at detchard s legs the englishman jumping to one side turned his sword against the king and with a cry the king fell to the ground detchard moved towards me again stepped in the doctor s blood on the floor and fell to the ground himself i had him a second later his body lay across the dead doctor but was the king dead i had no time to find out because just then i heard the noise of the drawbridge coming down and that wild cat rupert of hentzau was still alive the king must wait for help while i fought his enemies i ran out of the room and up the steps towards the drawbridge and then i heard the sound of laughter rupert of hentzau was laughing he was standing alone in the middle of the bridge in the gateway on the far side stood a group of the duke s men they seemed too frightened to move come out michael you dog rupert shouted but a woman s wild cry answered him he s dead he s dead the men in the gateway moved to one side and a woman came forward her face was as white as her long dress and her dark hair lay over her shoulders in her hand she held a gun the shot rang out but she missed rupert laughed again an toinette de mauban faced him her gun ready but before she could shoot rupert jumped over the side of the bridge and down into the moat below at that moment i heard the sound of running feet inside the new castleand the welcome voice of my old friend captain sapt then i knew that the king was safe and needed me no more i ran out on to the bridge and jumped down into the moat i had business to finish with rupert of hentzau i swam hard and caught up with him round the corner of the old castle he had found my rope climbed out of the moat and was already running towards the trees where i had left my horse i ran after him as fast as i could he turned and saw me and called out laughing why it s the play actor but then with a cry of surprise he found my horse and in a minute he was on its back get down i shouted stand and fight like a man he turned waiting for me and i ran at him with my sword for a few minutes we fought wildly blood ran from his face where i had cut it but i had fought too many fights that night he would surely kill me now i was saved by fritz who came galloping round the castle to find me when rupert saw him coming he knew he had no chance goodbye rudolf rassendyll he called we ll meet again and he rode away into the forest laughing and singing and still alive i fell to the ground blood was running again from the cut in my arm and i could not stand fritz jumped down from his horse and lifted me in his arms dear friend he said thank god i ve found you when johann did not come we had to break down the castle door we were afraid we would be too late and the king i said thanks to a very brave englishman fritz said gently the king is alive goodbye to ruritania old sapt worked hard to keep our secret hidden he sent messages told lies and gave orders all his plans were successful except one nothing can stop a woman in love when princess flavia heard that the king was hurt she refused to stay at tarlenheim house and rode at once to the castle of zenda sapt had hidden me in a room in the old castle and he and fritz brought her to me there how happy she was to see me she threw her arms round my neck and kissed me no cried sapt it s not the king don t kiss him he is the man you love but he is not the king flavia s face went white what do you mean she cried she turned to me again rudolf why do you let them say these things i looked deeply into her eyes it s true i said quietly i am not the king for a minute she continued to hold on to me she looked at sapt at fritz and finally at me again then slowly she fell forward and i laid her gently on the ground i wish that rupert had killed me i said i saw the king once more he thanked me and i gave him back the royal elphberg ring if he noticed flavia s ring on my finger he said nothing we both knew that we would never meet again before i left ruritania princess flavia asked to see me again and fritz took me to her they had told her everything we had so much to say and so little to say a princess is not free to choose who to love flavia i said i love you i ll love you until the day i die as i walked away i heard her say my name again and again rudolf rudolf i can hear it now i live quietly now but every year fritz and i meet in a little town outside ruritania there he gives me news of the queen of ruritania the wife of king rudolf the fifth and every year he brings me a red rose and a note with the words written rudolf flavia always and i send her a red rose with the same message shall i ever see her again who knows through the open windows of the room came the rich scent of summer flowers lord henry wotton lay back in his chair and smoked his cigarette beyond the soft sounds of the garden he could just hear the noise of london in the centre of the room there was a portrait of a very beautiful young man and in front of it stood the artist himself basil hallward it s your best work basil the best portrait that you ve ever painted said lord henry lazily you must send it to the best art gallery in london no basil said slowly no i won t send it anywhere lord henry was surprised but my dear basil why not he asked what strange people you artists are you want to be famous but then you re not happy when you are famous it s bad when people talk about you but it s much worse when they don t talk about you i know you ll laugh at me replied basil but i can t exhibit the picture in an art gallery i ve put too much of myself into it lord henry laughed too much of yourself into it you don t look like him at all he has a fair and beautiful face and you well you look intelligent of course but with your strong face and black hair you are not beautiful you don t understand me harry replied basil lord henry s friends always called him harry of course i m not like him basil continued in fact i prefer not to be beautiful dorian gray s beautiful face will perhaps bring him danger and trouble dorian gray is that his name asked lord henry yes but i didn t want to tell you why not oh i can t explain said basil when i like people a lot i never tell their names to my other friends i love secrets that s all of course agreed his friend life is much more exciting when you have secrets for example i never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what i m doing when we meet and we do meet sometimes we tell each other crazy stories and we pretend that they re true you pretend all the time harry said basil i think that you re probably a very good husband but you like to hide your true feelings oh don t be so serious basil smiled lord henry let s go into the garden in the garden the leaves shone in the sunlight and the flowers moved gently in the summer wind the two young men sat on a long seat under the shadow of a tall tree before i go said lord henry you must answer my question basil why won t you exhibit dorian gray s portrait in an art gallery he looked at his friend and smiled please give me the real reason now not the answer that you gave me before harry when an artist feels strongly about a portrait it becomes a portrait of himself not of the sitter the artist paints the face and body of the sitter but in fact he shows his own feelings the reason why i won t exhibit this portrait is because i m afraid it shows the secret of my heart lord henry laughed and what is this secret of your heart his friend was silent lord henry picked a flower and looked at it with interest two months ago basil said at last i was at a party at lady brandon s house i was talking to friends when i realized that someone was watching me i turned and saw dorian gray for the first time we looked at each other and i felt a sudden very strong fear i felt that this person could change my life could bring me happiness and unhappiness later lady brandon introduced us we laughed at something that she said and became friends at once he stopped lord henry smiled tell me more he said how often do you see him every day answered basil i m not happy if i don t see him every day he s necessary to my life but i thought you only cared about your art said lord henry he is all my art now replied basil seriously since i met dorian gray the work that i ve done is good the best work of my life because of him i see art in a different way a new way when i m with him i paint wonderful pictures basil this is extraordinary i must meet dorian gray said lord henry basil got up and walked up and down the garden so that s my secret dorian doesn t know about my feelings and i can t let people see the portrait because it shows what s in my heart there s too much of myself in it harry too much lord henry looked at basil s face before he spoke tell me does dorian gray care about you the artist thought for a few moments he likes me he said at last i know he likes me usually he s very friendly to me but sometimes he seems to enjoy hurting me he says unkind things that give me pain harry and then i feel that i ve given myself to somebody who thinks my heart is a pretty flower a flower that he can enjoy for a summer s day and can forget tomorrow summer days basil said lord henry witn a smile can sometimes be too long perhaps you ll become tired sooner than he will harry don t talk like that while i live dorian gray will be important to me you change your feelings too quickly you can t feel what i feel my dear basil how unkind you are lord henry was amused how interesting other people s lives were he thought slowly he pulled a flower to pieces with his long fingers i remember now he continued i think my aunt knows dorian gray i d like to meet him very much but i don t want you to meet him said basil a servant came across the garden towards them mr dorian gray has arrived sir he said to basil you have to introduce me now laughed lord henry basil turned to him dorian gray is my dearest fried he said quietly he s a good person and he s young only twenty don t change him don t try to influence him your clever words are very amusing of course but you laugh at serious things don t take him away from me he s necessary to my life as an artist lord henry smiled you worry too much my friend he said and together they walked back into the house as they entered the house they saw dorian gray he was sitting by the window and turning some pages of music you must lend me this music basil he said then he turned and saw lord henry oh i m sorry basil i didn t realize dorian this is lord henry wotton said basil he s an old friend of mine dorian gray shook hands with lord henry and while they talked lord henry studied the young man yes he was very good looking indeed with his bright blue eyes and his gold hair he had an open honest face there were no dark secrets in that face lord henry could understand basil s feelings for him basil was getting his paints ready now he looked at lord henry harry he said i want to finish this portrait of dorian today i m afraid i must ask you to go away lord henry smiled and looked at dorian gray should i go mr gray he asked oh please don t leave lord henry basil never talks when he s painting and it s so boring please stay i d like you to talk to me well basil lord henry asked the artist bit his lip very well harry stay if you must while basil painted lord henry talked and the young man listened the words filled dorian s head like music wild exciting music what a beautiful voice lord henry has he thought they are only words but how terrible they are how bright and dangerous you cannot escape from words dorian began to understand things about himself that he had never understood before why had he never seen himself so clearly he wondered lord henry watched dorian and smiled he knew when to speak and when to be silent he felt very interested in this young man with his wonderful face later they walked in the garden together while basil worked at the portrait the rich scent of the flowers was all around them dorian looked at the older man and wondered about him he was tall with a thin dark face and cool white hands dorian liked him but why did he feel a little afraid of him you must come out of the sun mr gray said lord henry a brown skin isn t fashionable and it won t suit you oh it doesn t matter laughed dorian but it should matter to you mr gray why asked dorian because you re young and being young is wonderful ah you smile you don t think so now but one day you ll understand what i mean when you re old and tired and no longer beautiful you have a wonderfully beautiful face mr gray it s true don t shake your head at me and there s nothing more important more valuable than beauty when your youth goes your beauty will go with it then you ll suddenly discover that your life is empty there will be nothing to enjoy nothing to hope for time is your enemy mr gray it will steal everything from you people are afraid of themselves today afraid to live but you with your face and your youth there s nothing that you cannot do you must live live the wonderful life that is in you we can never be young again youth ah there is nothing in the world as important as youth dorian gray listened and wondered new ideas filled his head he felt strange different at that moment basil called them from the house lord henry turned to dorian you re happy that you ve met me mr gray he said yes i m happy now will i always be happy i wonder always lord henry smiled what a terrible word women use it much too often what does it mean it s today that is important in the house basil hallward stood in front of the portrait of dorian gray it s finished he said he wrote his name in the corner of the picture lord henry studied the picture carefully yes he said it s your best work it s excellent mr gray come and look at yourself dorian looked at the picture for a long time he smiled as he saw the beautiful face in front of him and for a moment he felt happy but then he remembered lord henry s words how long he thought will i look like the picture time will steal my beauty from me i will grow old but the picture will always be young and his heart grew cold with fear don t you like it dorian asked basil at last of course he likes it said lord henry it s a very fine work of art i d like to buy it myself it s not mine to sell harry the picture is dorian s i wish cried dorian suddenly i wish that i could always stay young and that the picture could grow old lord henry laughed i don t think you would like that basil would you no i wouldn t like it at all agreed basil with a smile dorian turned his face red and angry yes you like your art better than your friends he said to basil how long will you like me only while i m beautiful i suppose lord henry is right youth is the most important thing in the world oh why did you paint this picture why should it stay young while i grow old i wish the picture could change and i could stay as i am i would give anything yes anything for that he hid his face in his hands dorian dorian said basil unhappily don t talk like that you re my dearest friend he turned to lord henry what have you been teaching him he asked angrily why didn t you go away when i asked you lord henry smiled it s the real dorian gray that s all basil turned and walked quickly over to the portrait it s my best work but now i hate it i will destroy it now before it destroys our friendship he picked up a long knife but dorian was there before him no basil don t you can t destroy it that would be murder so said basil coldly you ve decided that you like the portrait after all like it said dorian i m in love with it i cannot live without it later during tea lord henry invited basil and dorian to go with him to the theatre that night basil refused but dorian was happy to accept stay and have dinner with me dorian said basil but no dorian preferred to go to the theatre with lord henry as the door closed behind dorian and lord henry basil turned back to the picture i shall stay here with the real dorian gray he said sadly to himself the next morning lord henry went to visit his aunt lady agatha she was surprised to see him i thought you fashionable young men never got up until the afternoon she said ah but my dear aunt i need some information you see replied lord henry i met dorian gray yesterday and i d like to know more about him oh he s lord kelso s grandson said lady agatha his mother was lady margaret devereux a very beautiful woman she ran away from home to marry a poor soldier he was killed a few months later and she died soon after her son was born she was a lovely woman dorian gray has her beauty and he will i understand have his grandfather s money he is agreed lord henry extraordinarily good looking come to lunch invited his aunt dorian gray will be here and you can meet him again i d love to come smiled lord henry as he left lord henry thought about this sad story he became more interested than ever in this beautiful young man dorian gray he remembered the night before when dorian had watched him with his bright blue eyes half wondering half afrald he does not yet know himself thought lord henry with a smile but i can teach him yes i can influence him in any way that i please i will teach him to discover the fire of youth and love and life the conversation among the fashionable people at lady agatha s lunch was quick and clever lord henry talked in his lazy amusing way and knew that dorian gray was watching and listening after a while the conversation turned to a friend s plans to marry an american girl why can t these american women stay in their own country they re always telling us that it s a paradise for women said lord burdon it is said lord henry that s the reason why they re so happy to escape from it they say laughed the man next to lady agatha that when good americans die they go to paris really and where do bad americans go to when they die asked lady agatha they go to america said lord henry people smiled and the conversation moved on to other things lord henry took ideas and played with them he gave them wings and they flew like brightly coloured birds around the room people laughed and smiled and told him that he should be more serious but dorian gray never took his eyes away from lord henry after lunch lord henry said that he was going to the park and as he left the room dorian gray touched his arm may i come with you he asked but i thought you d promised to go and see basil hallward lord henry replied yes but i d prefer to come with you please let me said dorian i want to listen to you talking nobody speaks as well as you do ah i ve talked enough for today lord henry smiled but you may come with me if you want to one afternoon a month later dorian gray visited lord henry dorian was excited and his eyes were shining harry he began i m discovering life i m doing everything that you told me to do i m in love who are you in love with asked lord henry calmly with an actress oh everybody s in love with an actress at some time in their lives said lord henry no harry this is different she s wonderful her name s sybil vane and one day she ll be a very famous actress she really is extraordinarily clever my dear boy said lord henry in his lazy voice no woman is extraordinarily clever women have nothing to say but they say it beautifully there are only five women in london who can give you real conversation but tell me about your wonderful actress how long have you known her harry i ll tell you all about her but you must promise not to laugh lord henry listened and smiled dorian had discovered an old dirty theatre in a poor street in london he had gone in to look for adventure but had found love he told lord henry the play had been shakespeare s romeo and juliet romeo was a fat old man with a terrible voice but juliet oh harry she was about seventeen with dark brown hair and a face like a flower she was the loveliest girl that i d ever seen in my life and her voice was like music i love her harry she s everything to me every night i go to see her in different plays and she s always wonderful that s the reason i suppose why you never have dinner with me now said lord henry but harry you and i see each other every day we always have lunch together said dorian in surprise i have to go and see sybil in the theatre every night you and basil must come with me to see her then you can see yourself how wonderful she is come tomorrow very well my dear dorian we ll come and watch your juliet but you ll be in love many times you know this is only the beginning after dorian had gone lord henry smiled to himself how amusing it was to watch this young man he thought he was very different now from the frightened boy in basil hallward s house he had opened like a flower in the sun and was learning to enjoy every pleasure in life and it is i thought lord henry who have taught him how to do this when lord henry returned home that night there was a letter for him lying on the table it told him that dorian gray was going to marry sybil vane mother mother i m so happy cried the girl and you must be happy too mrs vane put her thin white hands on her daughter s head i m only happy when i see you in the theatre she said and we are poor we need the money don t forget that what do we know about this young man you don t know his real name or anything about him no but i call him prince charming he s everything to me i love him and he loves me oh mother let me be happy you re too young to think of love said her mother she looked at her daughter s lovely face and tried to warn her of the dangers of love but the girl did not listen she was locked in her prison of love at that moment the girl s brother entered the room he was a heavy dark young man not at all like his sister i ve heard about a gentleman who visits you every night at the theatre he said to his sister who is he what does he want oh james don t be angry with me today cried sybil you re leaving for australia tomorrow and today is your last day come for a walk with me in the park i ll go and get ready she danced out of the room and her mother and brother could hear her singing as she ran upstairs james vane turned to his mother my new life as a sailor will keep me away from england for many years he said but i don t like to leave sybil alone sybil has me her mother you know said mrs vane quietly then take care of her james vane gave his mother a long hard look if that man hurts my sister i ll find him and kill him like a dog as they waited for dorian gray the next night lord henry and basil hallward discussed sybil vane basil had not been happy at the news of dorian s marriage plans an actress he had cried but dorian is a gentleman the grandson of lord kelso he can t marry an actress why not lord henry had said coolly he ll love her wildly for six months and then suddenly he ll be in love with another woman it will be very amusing to watch but when dorian arrived and told the story of his love basil became a little happier you re right he told dorian the woman that you love must be wonderful i can see already that she s changed you yes said dorian happily yes sybil has changed me from this moment i shall be good i ll never listen again harry to your dangerous ideas about life and pleasure lord henry smiled ah he said when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy basil hallward shook his head at this but dorian laughed you cut life to pieces with your clever words harry the theatre was crowded and noisy but when sybil vane appeared everyone became silent she was one of the most beautiful girds that lord henry had ever seen lovely lovely he said softly but although sybil looked beautiful her voice sounded unnatural she spoke juliet s words but there was no feeling in them her voice was lovely but it took away all the life from the words people in the theatre began talking loudly and after half an hour lord henry stood up and put on his coat she s very beautiful dorian but she s not an actress he said let s go i think that miss vane must be ill added basil we ll come another night dorian did not look at them go away i want to be alone he said miserably and as his friends left he covered his face with his hands when the play came to its painful end dorian went to see sybil i wasn t a very good juliet tonight she said and looked at him with love in her eyes you were terrible said dorian coldly my friends were bored i was bored i suppose you were ill she did not seem to hear him dorian she cried before i knew you the theatre was my only life i thought that it was all true i knew nothing but shadows and i thought that they were real but you ve taught me the difference between art and life how can i pretend to be juliet to feel juliet s love when i know now what true love is dorian turned his face away from her but i loved you for your art because you were a wonderful actress he said his voice was hard you have killed my love without your art you are nothing i never want to see you again sybil s face was white with fear you re not serious are you dorian she asked she touched his arm with her small gentle hand don t touch me he shouted angrily he pushed her away and she fell to the floor and lay there like a broken bird dorian please don t leave me she cried i love you better than anything in the world don t leave me dorian gray looked down at her with his beautiful eyes there was no love or gentleness in his face i m going he said at last i don t wish to be unkind but i don t want to see you again without another word he left her all night he walked through the streets of london when morning came he went home when he entered his house he saw the portrait of himself that basil hallward had painted there was something different about it he thought the face had changed there was something unkind and cruel about the mouth it was very strange he picked up a mirror and looked at his own face and then looked again at the face in the portrait yes it was different what did this change mean suddenly he remembered his wish in basil hallward s house his wish that he could stay young but the picture could grow old the idea was impossible of course but why did the face in the picture have that cruel unkind mouth cruel had he been cruel to sybil vane he remembered her white unhappy face as she lay at his feet but she had hurt him too no sybil vane was nothing to him now but the picture watched him with its beautiful face and its cruel smile it had taught him to love his own beauty would it also teach him to hate his own heart his own soul no he would go back to sybil vane he would marry her try to love her again poor child how cruel he had been to her they would be happy together he covered the picture and quickly left the room it was long past midday when dorian woke up his servant brought him tea and his letters but he did not read them yesterday seemed like a bad dream but when he went downstairs he saw the covered picture should he uncover it he wondered had the face in the picture really changed did he want to know he lit a cigarette and thought for a while yes he had to know he lifted the cover there was no mistake the portrait had really changed he could not explain it could not understand it it was impossible but it had happened dorian felt sick and ashamed he did not know what to do or what to think finally he sat down and wrote a long letter to sybil vane he covered page after page with wild words of love then suddenly he heard lord henry s voice at the door dorian jumped up and covered the picture my dear boy said lord henry as he came in i m so sorry but you must not think too much about her do you mean about sybil vane asked dorian there s nothing to be sorry about i want to be good and i m going to be happy i shall marry sybil vane i m not going to break my promise to her marry sybil vane lord henry stared at dorian didn t you get my letter i haven t read my letters today said dorian slowly lord henry walked across the room and took dorian s hands in his own dorian he said quietly don t be frightened my letter told you that sybil vane is dead she killed herself at the theatre last night no no that s impossible cried dorian he pulled his hands away and stared at lord henry with wild eyes this is terrible harry i have murdered sybil vane she killed herself said lord henry calmly you didn t murder her she killed herself because she loved you it s very sad of course but you mustn t think too much about it you must come and have dinner with me harry listen last night i told her that i didn t want to see her again but after i left her i realized how cruel i had been i decided to go back to her to marry her and now she is dead harry what shall i do you don t know the danger that i am in my dear dorian said lord henry marriage with sybil vane was not for you no no marriages like that are never successful the man quickly becomes unhappy and bored of course he s kind to his wife we can always be kind to people that we re not interested in but the woman soon discovers that her husband is bored and then she either becomes terribly unfashionable or wears very expensive hats that another woman s husband has to pay for the young man walked up and down me room i suppose that s true he said unhappily but harry i don t think that i m cruel do you lord henry smiled he told dorian gray what he wanted to hear and then he told him clever amusing stories about the women that he himself had loved he said that sybil vane s death was a beautiful end to a love story for an actress the girl never really lived he continued so she never really died don t cry for sybil vane she was less real than juliet after a while dorian gray looked up you have explained me to myself harry he said slowly how well you know me but we won t talk of this again it s been a wonderful lesson for me that s all when lord henry had left dorian uncovered the picture again he had to choose between a good life and a bad life he thought but then he realized that in fact he had already chosen he would stay young for ever and enjoy every wild pleasure that life could give him the face in the picture would grow old and ugly and unkind but he would stay beautiful for ever he covered the picture again and smiled an hour later he was at lord henry s house and lord henry was smiling at his side while dorian was having breakfast the next morning basil hallward came to see him at last i ve found you dorian he said seriously i came last night but they told me that you d gone out to dinner with friends i knew that wasn t true of course i wanted to tell you how sorry i was about sybil vane poor girl my dear basil said dorian he looked bored i was at lord henry s house last night it was a very amusing evening basil stared at him you went out to dinner he said slowly you went out to dinner when sybil vane was lying dead in some dirty theatre stop basil i won t listen to you dorian jumped to his feet sybil vane is in the past finished forgotten you ve changed dorian said basil you have the same wonderful face but where is the kind and gentle boy who sat for my portrait have you no heart yesterday my heart was full of sadness i have cried for sybil yes but i cannot cry today i have changed basil i m a man now with new feelings new ideas don t be angry with me i am what i am there s nothing more to say basil watched him sadly well dorian he said at last i won t speak of poor sybil again but will you come and sit for another portrait soon no never said dorian quickly it s impossible but why asked basil very surprised and why have you covered the portrait he walked across the room towards the painting dorian cried out in fear and ran between basil and the portrait no basil you must not look at it i don t want you to see it his face was white and angry if you try to look at it i ll never speak to you again the artist stared at him why can t i look at my own work he asked i m going to exhibit it in an art gallery in paris soon dorian tried to hide his fear but you said you told me that you would never exhibit the picture why have you changed your mind he came closer to basil and looked into his face tell me why he said basil turned away after a while he said slowly i see that you too have noticed something strange about the picture dorian you changed my life as an artist from the moment when i met you you became very important to me i could not stop thinking about you and when i painted this portrait i felt that i d put too much of myself into it i could not let other people see it he was silent for a moment then turned back to dorian perhaps you re right i cannot exhibit this picture but will you let me look at it again no never the artist smiled sadly well i ve told you my secret now try to understand me dorian you ve been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art as he left the room dorian gray smiled to himself what a dangerous moment that had been poor basil although he had told his own secret he had not discovered dorian s secret but the picture he must hide it away at once no one must ever see it again he had the covered portrait carried upstairs to a small room at the top of the house then he locked the door and kept the key himself he felt safe now because only his eyes would see the terrible changes in that beautiful face when he returned to the room downstairs he picked up a book that lord henry had lent him he sat down and began to read it was the story of a frenchman who had spent his life searching for beauty and pleasure pleasure of all kinds both good and bad dorian read for hours it was a frightening book full of strange ideas and dangerous dreams dreams that slowly became real for dorian dorian read this book many times in fact he could not stop reading it and over the years it became more and more interesting to him he felt that the frenchman s life was a mirror of his own and so the years passed but time did not touch the face of dorian gray that wonderful beauty the beauty that basil hallward had painted never left him he enjoyed the life of a rich and fashionable young man he studied art and music and filled his house with beautiful things from every corner of the world but his search for pleasure did not stop there he became hungry for evil pleasures he became more and more in love with the beauty of his face more and more interested in the ugliness of his soul after a while strange stories were heard about him stories of a secret more dangerous life but when people looked at that young and good looking face they could not believe the evil stories and they still came to the famous dinners at his house where the food and the music and the conversation were the best in london but behind the locked door at the top of the house the picture of dorian gray grew older every year the terrible face showed the dark secrets of his life the heavy mouth the yellow skin the cruel eyes these told the real story again and again dorian gray went secretly to the room and looked first at the ugly and terrible face in the picture then at the beautiful young face that laughed back at him from the mirror after his twenty fifth year the stories about him became worse he was sometimes away from home for several days he was seen fighting with foreign sailors in bars he was friendly with thieves and in the houses of fashionable people men sometimes turned away when he entered a room women s faces sometimes went white when they heard his name but many people only laughed at these stories dorian gray was still a very rich and fashionable man and the dinners at his house were excellent people agreed with lord henry who once said in his amusing way that a good dinner was more important than a good life as the months and years passed dorian gray grew more and more afraid of the picture he both hated it and loved it and he became more and more afraid that someone would discover his secret for weeks he tried not to go near it but he could not stay away from it for long sometimes when he was staying in friends houses he suddenly left and hurried back to london he wanted to be sure that the room was still locked and the picture was still safe at one time he used to spend winters with lord henry in a little house in algiers but now he no longer travelled outside england his fear grew stronger every year and as time passed the face in the picture grew slowly more terrible it was the ninth of november the evening before his thirty eighth birthday dorian gray was walking home from lord henry s house when he saw basil hallward he felt strangely afraid and tried to pretend that he had not seen him but basil hurried after him dorian he called what extraordinary luck i m catching the midnight train to paris and i wanted to see you before i left i ll be away from england for six months he put his hand on dorian s arm look we re near your house may i come in for a moment i have something to say to you of course but won t you miss your train asked dorian lazily as he walked up the steps to his door i have plenty of time it s only eleven o clock they went in and sat down by the fire now my dear dorian i want to speak to you seriously basil began i must tell you that people in london are saying the most terrible things about you dorian lit a cigarette and looked bored i don t want to know anything about it it doesn t interest me but it must interest you dorian said basil every gentleman is interested in his good name of course when i look at you i know that these stories can t be true a man s face shows if his life is good or bad but why does lord berwick leave the room when you enter it why does lord staveley say that no honest woman is safe with you that young soldier who was your friend why did he kill himself there was sir henry ashton who had to leave england with a bad name and what about lord kent s son what kind of life does he have now stop basil you don t know what you re talking about said dorian coldly did i teach these people how to live their lives and the people who tell these stories are their lives any better than mine and there are other stories too continued basil are they true can your life really be so bad so evil you were a fine young man once but now when i hear these stories i wonder do i know you at all what has happened to the real dorian gray i think i would have to see your soul before i could answer those questions the real dorian gray asked dorian quietly his face white with fear yes said the artist sadly but only god can see your soul a terrible laugh came from the younger man come basil he cried come with me i will show you what only god can see why not it s your own work you ve talked enough about evil now you must look at it he took basil upstairs to the locked room inside he turned to the artist with smiling lips and cold hard eyes you re the one man in the world who should know my secret are you sure that you want to yes then uncover that picture basil and you will see my soul a cry of horror came from the artist when he saw the terrible face in the portrait how could that evil and unlovely face be dorian gray s but yes it was he went nearer to the picture it could not be the portrait that he had painted but yes there was his name written in the corner he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man what does this mean he asked at last when you finished the portrait replied dorian i made a wish i remember yes said basil you wished that the picture could become old and that you could stay young but this he stared again at the picture this is impossible and you told me that you d destroyed the picture i was wrong it has destroyed me my god dorian cried the artist if this is true if this is the face of your soul then you are more evil than the worst of the stories about you he sat down at the table and put his face in his hands you must ask god for his help it s too late basil it s never too late dorian look at that terrible face look at it dorian turned and stared at the face in the picture and suddenly he hated basil more than he had ever hated anyone in his life basil now knew his secret and had seen the real dorian gray violent feelings burned inside dorian he picked up a knife from the table then the hate inside him exploded and like a wild animal he ran towards basil and dug the knife into the artist s neck again and again and again the murdered man s head fell forwards and the blood ran slowly across the table and down onto the floor dorian stood and listened he could hear nothing only the drip drip of blood onto the floor he went to the window and looked down into the street he felt strangely calm the friend who had painted his portrait had gone out of his life that was all he locked the door behind him and went quietly downstairs his servants were all in bed he sat down and began to think no one had seen basil in dorian s house tonight paris yes basil had gone to paris of course so it would be six months before people asked where he was six months that was more than enough time dorian walked up and down the room then he took out a book from his desk and began to search for a name alan campbell yes that was the name that he wanted the next morning dorian wrote two letters he put one of them into his pocket and he gave the other to his servant take this to mr campbell s house at once he said while dorian waited he picked up a book and tried to read but after a time the book fell from his hand perhaps alan campbell was out of england perhaps he would refuse to come he was a very clever scientist and five years ago he and dorian had been good friends but now alan never smiled when he met dorian each minute seemed an hour to dorian but at last the door opened dorian smiled alan he said thank you for coming i never wanted to enter your house again but your letter said that it was a question of life and death said alan campbell his voice was hard and cold yes alan it is please sit down across the table the two men s eyes met dorian was silent for a moment then very quietly he said alan in a locked room upstairs there is a dead body i want you to destroy it there must be nothing left i know you can do this i don t want to know your terrible secrets i refuse to help you campbell replied but you must alan you re the only person who can help me dorian smiled sadly he took a piece of paper wrote something on it and pushed it across the table to campbell as campbell read the piece of paper his face went white he looked at dorian with hate and fear in his eyes i m so sorry for you alan said dorian gently i ve already written a letter and if you don t help me i ll have to send it but i think that you will help me campbell put his face in his hands and was silent for a long time dorian waited i ll need some things from my house campbell said at last dorian sent his servant to fetch the things that campbell needed and the two men waited silently when the servant returned dorian took the scientist upstairs to the locked room as they entered dorian remembered that the portrait was uncovered he turned to cover it then stopped and stared in horror one of the hands in the picture was red with blood for dorian this was more terrible than the dead body in the room with shaking hands he quickly covered the picture leave me now ordered campbell five hours later campbell came back downstairs i ve done what you asked me to do he said and now goodbye i never want to see you again when campbell had left dorian went upstairs there was a terrible smell in the room but the dead body had gone later the same evening dorian gray was at a party he smiled and talked and looked as young and as good looking as ever but his head ached and at dinner he could not eat anything when lord henry asked him if he felt unwell dorian said that he was tired and would go home early at home he felt worse although the room was warm his hands shook with cold he wanted to forget for a while to escape from the prison of his real life and to lose himself in dreams at midnight in old dirty clothes he left the house again and went to the east end of london there he knew places where he could get opium dark evil places where people bought and sold the beautiful terrible dreams of opium he had been there many times before he found the house that he was looking for and went into a long low room men were lying on the dirty floor a sailor was asleep on a table and two women were drinking at the bar as dorian hurried up the narrow stairs the sweet heavy smell of opium came to meet him and he smiled in pleasure but in the room he saw a young man who had once been his friend he turned away and went downstairs again to drink at the bar one of the women spoke to him don t talk to me said dorian angrily and walked towards the door i remember you you re prince charming aren t you she shouted after him the sleeping sailor woke up when he heard these words and as dorian left the house the sailor hurried after him dorian walked quickly along the road but as he reached a corner hands closed around his neck a man pulled him backwards and pushed him against a wall dorian fought wildly and pulled the hands away then he saw the gun in the man s hand what do you want he said quickly keep quiet said the man if you move i ll shoot you you re crazy what have i done to you you destroyed the life of sybil vane answered the sailor and sybil vane was my sister she killed herself because of you i ve been looking for you for years but i only knew the name that she used to call you prince charming well tonight i heard your name and tonight you re going to die dorian gray grew sick with fear i never knew her i ve never heard of her you re crazy he cried suddenly he had an idea how long ago did your sister die he asked eighteen years ago james vane replied why do you ask me eighteen years laughed dorian gray take me to the light and look at my face james vane stared at dorian then he pushed him towards the light and in the light he saw the face of a boy of twenty this man was too young he was not the man who had destroyed his sister s life my god he cried i nearly murdered you go home and put that gun away before you get into trouble said dorian and he walked quickly away james vane stared after him in horror then a woman s hand touched his arm why didn t you kill him she asked he s evil he s not the man that i m looking for answered the sailor the man who i want must be nearly forty now that man is only a boy a boy the woman laughed her voice was hard it s eighteen years since i met prince charming and his pretty face hasn t changed in all that time it s true i promise you james vane ran to the corner of the road but dorian gray had disappeared a week later dorian gray was at his house in the country where he had invited lord henry and several other friends among them was the pretty lady monmouth and her much older husband lady monmouth was amusing and clever and seemed to like dorian gray very much one afternoon as they laughed and talked together during tea dorian went out to fetch a flower for lady monmouth s dress lord henry smiled at lady monmouth i hope you re not in love with dorian my dear he s very dangerous she laughed oh men are much more interesting when they re dangerous just then they heard the sound of a heavy fall lord henry ran out of the room and found dorian lying unconscious on the floor when dorian opened his eyes lord henry said my dear dorian you must take care of yourself you re not well dorian stood up slowly i m all right harry i m all right as he dressed for dinner in his room dorian remembered what he had seen and cold fear ran through him like a knife he had seen a face watching him at the window and he had recognized it it was the face of james vane the next day he did not leave the house in fact for most of the day he stayed in his room sick with fear every time he closed his eyes he saw again the sailor s face he tried to tell himself that he had dreamt it yes it was impossible sybil vane s brother did not know his name and was probably on his ship at sea no of course he had not seen james vane s face at the window but the fear stayed with him dream or no dream two days passed and dorian grew less afraid on the third day a clear bright winter morning dorian joined his friends on a shooting party with lady monmouth by his side he walked to the edge of the forest where the men were shooting at birds and small animals the cold air and the sounds and smells of the forest filled dorian with happiness suddenly one of the men shot into the trees near them there were two cries in the morning air the cry of an animal and the cry of a man both in pain there were shouts and calls from the men and then a man s body was pulled from the trees dorian turned away in horror bad luck seemed to follow him everywhere people began to walk back towards the house lord henry came over to tell dorian that the man was dead dorian shook his head oh harry he said slowly i feel that something terrible is going to happen to some of us to me perhaps lord henry laughed at this idea what could happen to you dorian you have everything in the world that a man can want forget about this accident it was just an accident not murder then he added with a smile but it would be very interesting to meet a person who had murdered somebody what a terrible thing to say cried lady monmouth don t you agree mr gray mr gray are you ill again your face is so white dorian smiled and tried to speak calmly it s nothing he said quietly but please excuse me i think i must go and lie down upstairs in his room dorian s body shook with fear like a leaf in the wind he felt that he could not stay another night in the house death walked there in the sunlight he decided to return immediately to london and to visit his doctor his servant came to pack his clothes and while he was doing this he told dorian that the dead man was a sailor but no one knew his name a sailor cried dorian he jumped to his feet a wild hope filled him i must see the body at once he hurried to the house where the body lay and when he uncovered the face of the dead man he saw that it was james vane he cried with happiness and knew that now he was safe you re going to be good said lord henry don t tell me that you re wonderful as you are please don t change his long white fingers played with a flower on the table it was spring in london and the two friends were having dinner at lord henry s house dorian gray shook his head no harry i ve done too many terrible things in my life and i m going to change i began my good life yesterday in the country my dear boy smiled lord henry everybody can be good in the country there s nothing to do in the country so it s impossible to do anything bad but tell me how did you begin your good life there was a girl in a village a very beautiful girl an honest country girl she loved me and was ready to come away with me yesterday but i said no i refused to destroy her young life and i ve left her as honest as i found her lord henry laughed you ve left here with a broken heart you mean how can she be happy now with a country boy after she has known you don t harry cried dorian can you never be serious i m sorry that i told you now let s talk about other things what s been happening in london oh people are still discussing poor basil and how he disappeared i don t know why because there are plenty of other things that they can talk about my wife has run away with another man alan campbell has killed himself what do you think has happened to basil asked dorian slowly i ve no idea answered lord henry the english police report that basil went to paris on the midnight train on the ninth of november but the french police say that he never arrived in paris at all if basil wants to hide himself i really don t care and if he s dead i don t want to think about him death is the only thing that really frightens me i hate it harry don t people say that that basil was murdered said dorian some of the newspapers say so replied lord henry but who would want to murder poor basil he wasn t clever enough to have enemies what will you say harry if i tell you that i murdered basil asked dorian he watched his friend carefully lord henry smiled no my dear dorian murder wouldn t please you you like a different kind of pleasure and you should never do anything that you cannot talk about after dinner he lifted his coffee cup what happened to the fine portrait that basil painted of you i haven t seen it for years didn t you tell me that it was stolen what a pity oh i never really liked it said dorian i prefer not to think about it for a while the two men were silent then the older man lay back in his chair and looked at dorian with half closed eyes tell me how you have kept your youth and your wonderful beauty dorian you must have some secret i m only ten years older than you and i look like an old man but you haven t changed since the day when i first met you what a wonderful life you ve had yes said dorian slowly it s been wonderful harry but i m going to change it now you don t know everything about me his friend smiled you cannot change to me dorian you and i will always be friends dorian stood up i m tired tonight harry i must go home i ll see you at lunch tomorrow goodnight at the door he stopped for a moment and looked back but then he turned and went out without another word at home he thought about his conversation with lord henry could he really change he wondered he had lived an evil life and had destroyed other people s lives as well was there any hope for him why had he ever made that wish about the picture he had kept his youth and beauty but he had paid a terrible price for it his beauty had destroyed his soul he picked up a mirror and stared at his face what was he now a face without a heart suddenly he hated his own beauty and dropped the mirror on the floor where it broke into many small pieces james vane basil hallward sybil vane these deaths were not important to him now it was better not to think of the past nothing could change that he must think of himself perhaps he thought if i live a better life the picture will become less ugly he remembered the pretty village girl he had not destroyed her young life he had done one good thing perhaps the picture had already begun to look better he went quietly upstairs to the locked room yes he would live a good life and he need not be afraid any more of the evil face of his soul but when he uncovered the picture he gave a cry of pain there was no change the face in the picture was still terrible more hateful if possible than before and the red on the hand seemed brighter like new blood he stared at the picture with hate and fear in his eyes years ago he had loved to watch it changing and growing old now he could not sleep because of it it had stolen every chance of peace or happiness from him he must destroy it he looked round and saw the knife that had killed basil hallward now it will kill the artist s work he said to himself it will kill the past and when that is dead i will be free he picked up the knife and dug it into the picture there was a terrible cry and a loud crash the servants woke and two gentlemen who were passing in the road below stopped and looked up at the house a policeman came by and they asked him whose house is that mr dorian gray s sir was the answer the two gentlemen looked at each other then turned away from the house and walked on inside the house the servants talked in low frightened voices after some minutes they went up to the room they knocked but there was no reply they called out nothing they could not open the door so they climbed down from the roof and got in through the window against the wall they saw a fine portrait of the young dorian gray in all his wonderful youth and beauty lying on the floor was a dead man with a knife in his heart his face was old and ugly and yellow with disease only the rings on his fingers

it was the worst of times it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of sadness it was the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five in france there was a king and a queen and in england there was a king and a queen they believed that nothing would ever change but in france things were bad and getting worse the people were poor hungry and unhappy the king made paper money and spent it and the people had nothing to eat behind closed doors in the homes of the people voices spoke in whispers against the king and his noblemen they were only whispers but they were the angry whispers of desperate people late one november night in that same year a coach going from london to dover stopped at the top of a long hill the horses were tired but as they rested the driver heard an other horse coming fast up the hill behind them the rider stopped his horse beside the coach and shouted i want a passenger mr jarvis lorry from tellson s bank in london i am mr jarvis lorry said one of the passengers putting his head out of the window what do you want it s me jerry jerry cruncher from tellson s bank sir cried the man on the horse what s the matter jerry called mr lorry a message for you mr lorry you ve got to wait at dover for a young lady very well jerry said mr lorry tell them my answer is came back to life it was a strange message and a stranger answer no one in the coach understood what they meant the next day mr lorry was sitting in his hotel in dover when a young lady arrived she was pretty with golden hair and blue eyes and mr lorry remembered a small child almost a baby he had carried her in his arms when he came from calais to dover from france to england many years ago mr lorry asked the young lady to sit down miss manette he said i have a strange story to tell you about one of the customers of tellson s bank that s where i work yes but i don t quite understand mr lorry said the young lady i received a message from tellson s bank asking me to come here to meet you i understood there was some news about my poor father s money he died so long ago before i was born what is this story you want to tell me about twenty years ago miss manette a french doctor married an english lady they had a daughter but just before she was born her father disappeared nobody knew what had happened to him not long afterwards his unhappy wife died and their daughter was brought back to england but this is like my father s story mr lorry and wasn t it you who brought me back to england yes that s true miss manette many years ago i brought you from france to england and tellson s bank has taken care of you since then you were told that your father had died but think miss manette perhaps your father wasn t dead perhaps he was in prison not because he had done something wrong but just because he had a powerful enemy an enemy with the power to send him to prison and to keep him there hidden and forgotten for eighteen years can it be true is it possible that my father is still alive lucie manette stared at mr lorry her face was white and her hands trembled it will be his ghost not him no miss manette said mr lorry gently he is alive but he has changed very much even his name had been forgotten and we must ask no questions about the past no questions at all it would be too dangerous he has been taken to the house of an old servant in paris and we are going there to bring him back to life a wine shop in paris in the part of paris called saint antoine everyone was poor the streets were narrow and dirty the food shops were almost empty the faces of the children looked old already because they were so hungry in the wine shop of monsieur defarge there were not many customers and defarge was outside talking to a man in the street his wife madame defarge sat inside the shop knitting and watching defarge came in and his wife looked at him then turned her eyes to look at two new customers a man of about sixty and a young lady defarge went over to speak to them suddenly kissed the young lady s hand and led them out of the back of the shop they followed him upstairs many stairs until they reached the top defarge took a key out of his pocket why is the door locked asked mr lorry in surprise he is a free man now because he has lived too long behind a locked door replied defarge angrily he is afraid if the door is not locked that is one of the things they have done to him i m afraid too whispered miss manette her blue eyes looked worriedly at mr lorry i am afraid of him of my father defarge made a lot of noise as he opened the door mr lorry and lucie went into the room behind him a thin white haired man was sitting on a wooden seat he was very busy making shoes good day said defarge you are still working hard i see after a while they heard a whisper yes i am still working come said defarge you have a visitor tell him your name my name came the whisper one hundred and five north tower mr lorry moved closer to the old man dr manette don t you remember me jarvis lorry he asked gently the old prisoner looked up at mr lorry but there was no surprise no understanding in his tired face and he went back to work making shoes slowly lucie came near to the old man after a while he noticed her who are you he asked lucie put her arms around the old man and held him tears of happiness and sadness running down her face from a little bag the old man took some golden hair he looked at it and then he looked at lucie s hair it is the same how can it be he stared into lucie s face no no you are too young too young through her tears lucie tried to explain that she was the daughter he had never seen the old man still did not understand but he seemed to like the sound of lucie s voice and the touch of her warm young hand on his then lucie said to mr lorry i think we should leave paris at once can you arrange it yes of course said mr lorry but do you think he is able to travel he will be better far away from this city where he has lost so much of his life said lucie you are right said defarge and there are many other reasons why dr manette should leave france now while mr lorry and defarge went to arrange for a coach to take them out of paris lucie sat with her father exhausted by the meeting he fell asleep on the floor and his daughter watched him quietly and patiently until it was time to go when mr lorry returned he and defarge brought food and clothes for dr manette the doctor did everything they told him to do he had been used to obeying orders for so many years as he came down the stairs mr lorry heard him say again and again one hundred and five north tower when they went to the coach only one person saw them go madame defarge she stood in the doorway and knitted and watched seeing everything and seeing nothing a trial in london tellson s bank in the city of london was an old dark and ugly building it smelt of dust and old papers and the people who worked there all seemed old and dusty too outside the building sat jerry cruncher who carried messages for people in the bank one morning in march jerry had to go to the old bailey to collect an important message from mr lorry trials at the old bailey were usually for very dangerous criminals and the prisoner that morning was a young man of about twenty five well dressed and quite calm what s he done jerry asked the doorman quietly he s a spy a french spy the doorman told him he travels from england to france and tells the french king secret information about our english army what ll happen if he s guilty asked jerry oh he ll have to die no question of that replied the doorman enthusiastically they ll hang him what s his name darnay charles darnay not an english name is it while jerry waited he looked around at the crowd inside the old bailey and noticed a young lady of about twenty years and her father a gentleman with very white hair the young lady seemed very sad when she looked at the prisoner and held herself close to her father then the trial began and the first person who spoke against charles darnay was called john barsad he was an honest man he said and proud to be an englishman yes he was or had been a friend of the prisoner s and in the prisoner s pockets he had seen important plans and lists about the english armies no of course he had not put the lists there himself and no he was not a spy himself he was not someone paid to make traps for innocent people next the young lady spoke she said that she had met the prisoner on the boat which had carried her and her father from france to england he was very good and kind to my father and to me she said was he travelling alone on the ship no he was with two french gentlemen now miss manette did you see him show them any papers or anything that looked like a list no i didn t see anything like that questions questions questions the trial went on and finally a small red haired man spoke he told the judge that he had seen mr darnay at a hotel in a town where there were many soldiers and ships then one of the lawyers a man called sydney carton wrote some words on a piece of paper and gave it to mr stryver the lawyer who was speaking for mr darnay are you quite sure that the prisoner is the man you saw mr stryver asked the red haired man quite sure said the man have you ever seen anyone like the prisoner asked mr stryver i d always be able to recognize him the red haired man was very confident then i must ask you to look at the gentleman over there said mr stryver pointing to sydney carton don t you think that he is very like the prisoner everyone in the court could see that sydney carton and charles darnay were indeed very similar well then said mr stryver it is so easy to find a man like the prisoner that we can even find one in this room so how can you be so sure that it was the prisoner you saw in that hotel and the red haired man said not another word the lawyers talked and argued and when at last the trial came to an end jerry cruncher had fallen asleep but mr lorry woke him up and gave him a piece of paper not guilty were the words written on it and jerry hurried back to tellson s bank with the message sydney carton seemed to be a man who did not care about anyone or anything he was mr stryver s assistant in fact he did most of the real work for mr stryver stryver was good at speaking at a trial but he was not good at discovering important facts and details especially when these details were hidden in a lot of papers every night carton studied the many papers that lawyers have to read and he wrote down the questions which stryver should ask at the next day s trial and every day stryver asked these questions and people thought how clever he was outside the old bailey mr darnay now a free man met his friends dr manette and his daughter lucie mr jarvis lorry mr stryver and mr carton dr manette no longer looked like the man in the room above defarge s wine shop five years ago his hair was white but his eyes were bright and he stood straight and strong sometimes his face became dark and sad when he remembered the years in the bastille prison at these times only his daughter lucie whom he loved so much could help him as they stood there talking a strange expression came over dr manette s face he was staring at charles darnay but he did not seem to see him for a few moments there was dislike even fear in his eyes my father said lucie softly putting her hand on his arm shall we go home now yes he answered slowly soon they drove off in a coach and then mr stryver and mr lorry walked away leaving mr darnay and mr carton alone it must be strange for you said carton to be a free man again and to be standing here talking to a man who looks just like you let us go out and eat together after they had eaten carton said softly how sad and worried miss manette was for you today she s a very beautiful young woman don t you think darnay did not reply to what carton had said but he thanked him for his help at the trial i don t want your thanks replied carton i have done nothing and i don t think i like you well said darnay you have no reason to like me but i hope that you will allow me to pay the bill for both of us of course and as you are paying for me i ll have another bottle of wine after darnay had left carton drank some more wine and looked at himself in the mirror he was angry because darnay looked so much like him but was so different carton knew that he was a clever lawyer and that he was a good and honest man but he had never been successful for himself he drank too much and his life was unhappy and friendless his cleverness and his hard work in the law only made others like mr stryver successful and rich he remembered lucie manette s worried face when she watched darnay in court if i changed places with darnay he whispered to himself would those blue eyes of miss manette look at me in the same way no no it s too late now he drank another bottle of wine and fell asleep in a quiet street not far away was the house where dr manette and lucie lived they had one servant miss pross who had taken care of lucie since she was a child miss pross had red hair and a quick sharp voice and seemed at first sight a very alarming person but everybody knew that she was in fact a warm hearted and unselfish friend who would do anything to guard her darling lucie from trouble or danger dr manette was now well enough to work as a doctor and he lucie and miss pross led a quiet comfortable life mr lorry who had become a close family friend came regularly to the house and in the months after the trial mr darnay and mr carton were also frequent visitors this did not please miss pross at all who always looked very cross when they came nobody is good enough for my darling lucie she told mr lorry one day and i don t like all these hundreds of visitors mr lorry had a very high opinion of miss pross but he wasn t brave enough to argue that two visitors were not hundreds nobody argued with miss pross if they could avoid it the marquis of evremonde the marquis of evremonde was a disappointed man he had waited for hours at the palace of the king of france but the king had not spoken to him angrily the marquis got into his coach and told the driver to take him home very soon the coach was driving fast out of paris and the people in the narrow streets had to run to get out of the way if they could at the corner of a street in saint antoine one of the coach wheels hit something and the people in the street screamed loudly the horses were frightened and stopped what has gone wrong asked the marquis calmly looking out of the window of the coach a tall man had picked something up from under the feet of the horses and was crying loudly over it why is that man making that terrible noise asked the marquis impatiently i m sorry monsieur the marquis it is his child said one of the people dead killea screamed the man the people in the street came close to the coach and looked to the coach and looked at the marquis with stony silent faces the marquis looked back at them in bored dislike to him they were no more than animals i can t understand he said coldly why you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children i hope my horses are not hurt and he threw a gold coin to his driver give this to that man dead shouted the father of the child again another man came forward be brave gaspard your child has died quickly and without pain it is better to die like that than to go on living in these terrible times you are a sensible man said the marquis from his coach what is your name they call me defarge this is for you said the marquis and he threw defarge another gold coin drive on he called to his driver just as the coach was leaving a coin was thrown back in through the window the marquis looked angrily at the corner where defarge had been standing defarge had gone at the corner there now stood a large dark haired woman knitting she stared long and hard at the face of the marquis but he did not look at her and drove on later that day as the sun was going down the same coach stopped in a village near the marquis s castle several villagers in poor thin clothes with thin hungry faces were standing in the village square the marquis looked at their faces and then pointed to one of them bring that man to me he said to his driver the man came up to the coach hat in hand and the other villagers moved closer to listen i passed you on the road just outside the village said the marquis you were looking at my coach in a very strange way why was that monsieur i was looking at the man came the reply what man asked the marquis angrily the man who was holding on under your coach said the poor man trembling with fear what was he like oh monsieur he was white from head to foot all covered with dust just like a ghost where is he now what happened to him oh he ran away down the hill outside the village the marquis turned to speak to another man this was monsieur gabelle the marquis s official in the village gabelle the marquis said watch out for this man if he comes here put him in prison when the marquis arrived at his castle he asked if his nephew monsieur charles had arrived from england not yet sir replied the servant but as the marquis was eating his dinner he heard the sound of a coach outside soon his nephew entered the room in england he was known as charles darnay you ve been away for a long time said the marquis with his cold polite smile i ve had many problems in england perhaps because of you darnay said to his uncle i was in great danger no no i had nothing to do with your problems replied the marquis coldly unfortunately our family no longer has the power that it once had if it still had that power one word from you would doubtless send me to prison said darnay possibly for the good of our family the name of our family is hated everywhere in france we are hard cruel landowners our miserable people own nothing they work for us night and day but they don t even have enough food for themselves and their children if this land became mine i would give it away and go and live somewhere else you seem to be very fond of england although you are not a rich man there said the marquis i believe you know another frenchman who has found a safe home there a doctor i believe yes with a daughter yes yes said the marquis with a secret smile on his face so a new way of life begins but you are tired goodnight charles sleep well i shall see you in the morning after his nephew had gone to bed the marquis went to his room the castle was surrounded with darkness in the villages nearby the hungry people dreamt of a better life with enough good food to eat and time to rest from their work early in the morning the dreamers awoke and started their day s hard work the people in the castle did not get up until later but when they did why did the great bell start ringing why did people ride out of the castle to the village as fast as they could the answer lay in the bed of the marquis he lay there like stone with a knife pushed into his heart on his chest lay a piece of paper with the words drive him fast to his grave this is from jacques two men speak of love twelve months after the death of the marquis in france charles darnay had become a successful teacher of french in london he had known when he came to london that he would have to work hard to earn his living and he was successful he was also in love he had loved lucie manette from the time when his life was in danger in the old bailey he had never heard a sound so sweet as her gentle voice he had never seen a face so beautiful as hers but he had never spoken to her about his love the death of his uncle in france had become over the twelve months like a dream to him but he had said nothing to lucie of his feelings nor of what had happened he had good reason for this but one day in the summer he came to dr manette s home in london he knew that lucie was out with miss pross and he had decided to speak to her father dr manette was now strong in body and mind and sad memories of his long years in prison did not come back to him often when darnay arrived the doctor welcomed him warmly dr manette said darnay i know that lucie is out but i have come here today to speak to you there was a silence do you want to speak to me about lucie asked the doctor slowly yes dear dr manette i love your daughter dearly if there was ever love in the world i love lucie i believe you said dr manette sadly it s very hard for me to speak of her at any time but i believe you charles darnay have you spoken to lucie about your love no never i know how much your daughter means to you dr manette her love for you and your love for her these are the greatest things in your life and in hers i love lucie with all my heart i love her but i do not want to come between you and her the two of you will never be separated because of me for a moment dr manette turned his head away and his eyes were full of fear and pain then he looked back at darnay and tried to smile you have spoken very honestly charles he said have you any reason to believe that lucie loves you none then what do you want from me a promise a promise that if lucie ever tells you that she loves me you will not speak against me and will tell her what i have said i know that she would never accept me if she believed that it would make you unhappy i can promise you more than that charles if lucie ever tells me that she loves you i shall give her to you thank you dr manette said darnay gratefully there is one thing more my name in england is not my real name i want to tell you what my real name is and why i am in england stop said the doctor he had even put his hands over his ears i don t want to know tell me when i ask you if lucie agrees to marry you you shall tell me on the morning of your marriage it was dark when darnay left dr manette and it was some time later when lucie and miss pross came home father lucie called where are you she heard no answer but there were strange sounds coming from her father s bedroom frightened she ran upstairs and found her father pale and silent busy at his old prison work of making shoes the shadow of the bastille had fallen on him again she took his arm and spoke gently to him and together they walked up and down for a long time until at last dr manette went quietly to bed although mr carton visited dr manette s house quite often he usually said very little when he was there one day in august he arrived when dr manette was out and he was received by lucie she had always been a little shy with him but on that day she noticed something different in his face aren t you well mr carton she asked no probably not miss manette but my way of life is not good for my health that seems sad said lucie gently why do you not change your way of life it s too late for that i shall never be better than i am but miss manette there is something that i want to say to you but i find it so difficult will you listen to me if it will help you mr carton i will be happy to listen to you said lucie but she was pale and trembling miss manette i know that you could never have feelings of love for me a man who has spent his life so badly even without my love mr carton can i not save you can i not help you no miss manette said carton even if it was possible for you to love me it is too late for me i would only make you sad and destroy your life but it has been a last dream of my heart to see you and your father together to see the home that you have made for him this has brought back old and happier memories for me can i do nothing to help you asked lucie sadly only this miss manette let me remember that i spoke to you of the feelings of my heart and that you were kind and gentle towards me oh mr carton try again to change no miss manette it is too late my bad habits will never change now but tell me that you will never speak of what i have said today not to anyone not even to the person dearest to you mr carton said lucie this is your secret no one will ever know of it from me thank you miss manette i shall never speak of this again but in the hour of my death it will be a happy memory for me that my last words of love were to you lucie had never heard mr carton speak like this before tears came to her eyes as she thought of his hopeless miserable life don t cry said sydney carton i am not worth your love but you should know that for you or for anyone close to you i would do anything please remember always that there is a man who would give his life to keep someone you love alive and close to you goodbye miss manette on the day of lucie s marriage to charles darnay mr lorry and miss pross stood with lucie outside the door of dr manette s room inside the doctor and mr darnay had been talking together for a long time soon it would be time to leave for the church lucie looked very beautiful and mr lorry watched her proudly he talked about the day so long ago when he had brought lucie as a baby in his arms from france to england miss pross too had her memories and thought fondly of her brother solomon he had stolen money from her many years ago and she had never seen him since then but she still loved him the door of the doctor s room opened and he came out with charles darnay the doctor s face was white but he was calm he took his daughter s arm and they went out to the waiting coach the others followed in a second coach and soon in a nearby church lucie manette and charles darnay were marrined after the marriage lucie and charles came back to the house for breakfast and then lucie had to say goodbye to her father for two weeks the first time they had not been together since his return from paris when lucie and charles had left mr lorry noticed a change in the doctor a little sadness was natural but there was a lost frightened look in the doctor s eyes which worried mr lorry very much when he left to go to tellson s bank he whispered to miss pross that he would return as quickly as he could two hours later he hurried back to the house and miss pross met him at the door oh what shall we do mr lorry she cried he doesn t know me and is making shoes again mr lorry went up to the doctor s room dr manette my dear friend look at me don t you remember me but dr manette said nothing and worked on in silence once again he was a prisoner in the bastille without friends or family without even a name of his own for nine days and nine nights the shoemaker worked on leaving his table only to sleep eat or walk up and down his room mr lorry sat with him night and day talking gently to him from time to time trying to bring his friend s mind back to the present then at last on the tenth morning the shoemaking work was put away and dr alexandre manette pale but calm was his old self again lucie was never told and in the quiet and happy years that followed her marriage dr manette remained strong in mind and body stormy years in france in monsieur defarge s wine shop in saint antoine customers came and went all the time they came to drink the thin rough wine but more often they came to listen and to talk and to wait for news one day there were more customers than usual defarge had been away for three days and when he returned that morning he brought a stranger with him a man who repaired roads madame defarge said to his wife this man who is called jacques has walked a long way with me one customer got up and went out this mender of roads continued defarge who is called jacques is a good man give him something to drink a second man got up and went out the man who repaired roads sat down and drank a third man got up and went out have you finished my friend said defarge then come and see the room i promised you they went upstairs to the room where dr manette had sat making shoes the three men who had left the wine shop were waiting defarge spoke to them no names you are jacques one jacques two and jacques three i am jacques four this is jacques five he brings us news of our poor friend gaspard whose child was killed by the marquis s coach a year ago i first saw gaspard said jacques five holding on under the marquis s coach as it drove into our village he ran away but that night the marquis was murdered gaspard disappeared and was only caught a few weeks ago the soldiers brought him into the village and hanged him and they have left his body hanging in the village square where the women go to fetch water and our children play when jacques five had left them jacques one said to his friends what do you say shall we put their names on the list yes all of them the castle and all of the family of evr monde is the list safe asked jacques two yes my friend said defarge my wife remembers everything but more than that every name is carefully knitted into her work nothing can be forgotten a few days later defarge reported to his wife some news from his friend jacques in the police a new spy has been sent to saint antoine his name is barsad john barsad he s english what does he look like do we know he s about forty years old quite tall black hair thin face said defarge good said his wife i ll put him on the list tomorrow but you seem tired tonight and sad well said defarge it is a long time it takes time to prepare for change the crimes against the people of france cannot be revenged in a day but we may not live to see the end even if that happens replied madame defarge we shall help it to come but i believe that we shall see the day of our revenge against these hated noblemen the next day a stranger came into the wine shop at once madame defarge picked up a rose from the table and put it in her hair as soon as they saw this the customers stopped talking and one by one without hurrying left the wine shop good day madame said the stranger good day monsieur said madame defarge but to herself she said about forty years old tall black hair thin face yes i know who you are mr john barsad is business good asked the stranger business is bad the people are so poor madame defarge looked over to the door ah here is my husband good day jacques said the spy you re wrong said defarge staring at him that s not my name i am ernest defarge it s all the same said the spy easily i remember something about you monsieur defarge you took care of dr manette when he came out of the bastille that s true said defarge have you heard much from dr manette and his daughter they re in england now no not for a long time she was married recently not to an englishman but to a frenchman it s quite interesting when you remember poor gaspard miss manette has married the nephew of the marquis that gaspard killed her new husband is really the new marquis but he prefers to live unknown in england he s not a marquis there just mr charles darnay monsieur defarge was not happy at this news when the spy had gone he said to his wife can it be true if it is i hope that miss manette keeps her husband away from france who knows what will happen replied madame defarge i only know that the name of evr monde is in my list and for good reason she went on calmly knitting adding name after name to her list of the enemies of the people time passed and madame defarge still knitted the women of saint antoine also knitted and the thin hungry faces of jacques and his brothers became darker and angrier the noise of the coming storm in paris was growing louder it began one summer day in the streets of saint antoine around defarge s wine shop with a great crowd of people a crowd who carried guns knives sticks even stones anything that could be a weapon an angry crowd who shouted and screamed who were ready to fight and to die in battle friends and citizens shouted defarge we are ready to the bastille the crowd began to move like the waves of the sea follow me women cried madame defarge a long sharp knife shone brightly in her hand we can kill as well as any man the living sea of angry people ran through saint antoine to the bastille and soon the hated prison was ringing with the noise of battle fire and smoke climbed up the high stone walls and the thunder of the guns echoed through the city four terrible and violent hours then a white flag appeared above the walls and the gates were opened the bastille had been taken by the people of paris soon the crowds were inside the building itself and shouting free the prisoners but defarge put his strong hand on the shoulder of one of the soldiers show me the north tower take me to one hundred and five north tower quickly follow me said the frightened man and defarge and jacques three went with him through the dark prison past heavy closed doors up stone stairs until they came to a low door it was a small room with dark stone walls and only one very small window too high for anyone to look out defarge looked carefully along the walls there look there jacques three he cried a m whispered jacques a m alexandre manette said defarge softly let us go now but before they left they searched the room and the furniture very carefully looking for small hiding places then they returned to the crowds below the bastille and its officers were now in the hands of the people and the people wanted revenge and blood at last it has begun my dear said defarge to his wife it was the fourteenth of july in the village where the marquis had lived and where gaspard had died life was hard everything was old and tired and broken down the people the land the houses the animals in the past everything and everybody had had to work for the marquis and he had given nothing in return but now strangers were travelling about the country strangers who were poor like the people but who talked about new ideas ideas which had started in paris and were now running like fire across the country the road mender who had brought the news of gaspard to paris still worked repairing the roads one day a stranger came to him as he worked on the road outside the village jacques said the stranger he shook the road mender s hand and turned to look at the marquis s castle on the hill it s tonight jacques he went on quietly the others will meet me here it was very dark that night and the wind was strong no one saw the four men who came quietly to the castle and said nothing but soon the castle itself could be seen in the dark sky the windows became bright smoke and yellow flames climbed into the sky monsieur gabelle called loudly for help but the people in the village watched and did nothing to save the castle where the marquis had lived a call for help the troubles in france continued the citizens of france had fought to win power and now they used it castles were burned laws were changed and the rich and powerful nobles died their heads cut off by that terrible new machine of death the guillotine in paris the king was put in prison and in the people of france sent him to the guillotine as well the french revolution was now three years old but there were more years of terror to come not all the rich nobles had died some had escaped to england some had even sent or brought their money to london before the revolution began and tellson s bank which the french emigrants used had become a meeting place where they could hear and talk about the latest news from france one wet august day mr lorry sat at his desk in the bank talking to charles darnay the years since charles s marriage had seen the arrival of a daughter little lucie who was now nine years old dr manette had continued in good health and at the centre of that warm family circle was always lucie a loving daughter wife mother and a kind hearted friend even sydney carton though his old bad ways were unchanged was a family friend and very much a favourite with little lucie but at this moment charles darnay was trying very hard to persuade his old friend mr lorry not to go to france it s too dangerous the weather is not good the roads are bad think of your age he said my dear charles said the banker you think that at nearly eighty years of age i m too old but that s exactly why i must go i have the experience i know the business my work is to find and hide papers that might be dangerous to our customers and anyway jerry cruncher goes with me he ll take good care of my old bones i wish i could go said charles restlessly i feel sorry for the people in france and perhaps i could help them only last night when i was talking to lucie talking to lucie repeated mr lorry you talk about your lovely wife at the same time as you talk about going to france you must not go your life is here with your family well i m not going to france but you are and i m worried about you just at that moment a bank clerk put an old unopened letter on mr lorry s desk and darnay happened to see the name on it the marquis of evr monde at tellson s bank london since his uncle s death this was darnay s real name on the morning of his wedding to lucie he had told dr manette but the doctor had made him promise to keep his name secret not even lucie or mr lorry knew we can t find this marquis said the clerk i know where to find him said darnay shall i take the letter that would be very kind said mr lorry as soon as he had left the bank darnay opened the letter it was from monsieur gabelle who had been arrested and taken to paris monsieur once the marquis i am in prison and i may lose my life because i worked for a landowner who has left france you told me to work for the people and not against them and i have done this but no one believes me they say only that i worked for an emigrant and where is that emigrant oh monsieur please help me i beg you this cry for help made darnay very unhappy after the death of the marquis he had told gabelle to do his best for the people but now gabelle was in prison just because he was employed by a nobleman it was clear to darnay that he must go to paris he did not think that he would be in danger as he had done everything he could to help the people of his village he hoped that he would be able to save his old servant that night charles darnay sat up late writing two letters one was to his wife lucie the other was to her father dr manette he told them where he had gone and why and he promised that he would write to them from france he had left secretly he wrote to save them from worrying the next day he went out without saying anything to them of his plans he kissed his wife and his daughter and said that he would be back soon and then he began his journey to paris when he arrived in france darnay found that he could travel only very very slowly towards paris the roads were bad and every town every village had its citizens with guns who stopped all travellers asked them questions looked at their papers made them wait or threw them in prison turned them back or sent them on their way and it was all done in the name of freedom the new freedom of france darnay soon realized that he could not turn back until he had reached paris and proved himself to be a good citizen not an enemy of the people on his third night in france he was woken by an official and three other men with guns emigrant said the official these three soldiers will take you to paris and you must pay them darnay could only obey and at three o clock in the morning he left with three soldiers to guard him even with them he was sometimes in danger the people in the towns and villages all seemed to be very angry with emigrants but finally they arrived safely at the gates of paris darnay had to wait a long time while officials carefully read his papers which explained the reasons for his journey one official seeing gabelle s letter looked up at darnay in great surprise but said nothing another official asked roughly are you evr monde yes replied darnay you will go to the prison of la force but why asked darnay under what law we have new laws evr monde said the official sharply and emigrants have no rights you will be held in secret take him away as darnay left the first official said quietly to him are you the man who married the daughter of dr manette yes replied darnay in surprise my name is defarge and i have a wine shop in saint antoine perhaps you have heard of me yes my wife came to your house to find her father why did you come back to france it will be very bad for you darnay was taken to the prison of la force and put in a cold empty room with a locked door and bars across the windows he thought of dr manette and his many years alone forgotten in the bastille now i too have been buried alive he thought in the hands of the citizens tellson s bank in paris was in a large building south of the river close to the heart of the city mr lorry had arrived in paris some days before charles darnay and was now living in some rooms above the bank one evening looking out of the window he saw that a large grindstone had been brought into the square below there was a wild shouting crowd around it busy sharpening their knives and swords and axes which were already red with blood with shaking hands mr lorry closed the window he had decided to go downstairs and talk to the bank guards when suddenly the door of his room opened and lucie and her father ran in lucie manette what has happened why are you here cried mr lorry charles is in paris cried lucie he came to help an old family servant but he s been taken to prison at that moment the shouts of the crowd outside grew louder what is that noise asked the doctor don t look out cried mr lorry my friend said the doctor i am safe in paris i was a prisoner in the bastille every body knows about me and how i suffered already people want to help me they gave us news of charles even so don t look outside where is charles in the prison of la force la force dear lucie you can do nothing tonight you must go to one of the rooms here and wait i must told with your father at once lucie kissed him and left the room quick manette said mr lorry these people outside with their bloody knives are murdering the prisoners if you are so well known if you have this power talk to them tell them who you are and go to la force quick before it is too late dr manette hurried outside mr lorry watched from the window as the doctor talked to the crowd he heard shouts of long live the bastille prisoner help his friend in la force mr lorry went to lucie and found her with her daughter and miss pross together they waited all night for news but none came in the morning mr lorry found rooms for lucie and her family in a quiet street near the bank he left jerry cruncher with them as a guard and returned worriedly to tellson s at the end of the day a strong serious man came to see him my name is defarge i come from dr manette he gave me this defarge gave him a piece of paper the doctor had written charles is safe but i cannot leave this place yet take defarge to lucie come with me said mr lorry happily they went downstairs and at the front door found madame defarge knitting without a word she joined them and mr lorry led them to lucie s rooms there defarge gave lucie a note from her husband dearest be brave i am well and your father has some power here you cannot answer this but kiss our child for me only a short letter but it meant so much to lucie gratefully she kissed the hands of defarge and his wife madame defarge said nothing her hand was cold and heavy and lucie felt frightened of her miss pross came in with little lucie is that his child asked madame defarge stopping her knitting to stare yes madame said mr lorry that is our poor prisoner s little daughter it is enough my husband said madame defarge we can go now her voice was as cold as her hand you will be good to my husband asked lucie afraid i beg you as a wife and mother we have known many wives and mothers said madame defarge and we have seen many husbands and fathers put in prison for many years what is one more among so many as the defarges left lucie turned to mr lorry i am more afraid of her than of any other person in paris she whispered mr lorry held her hands he did not say anything but he was also very worried the doctor did not come back from la force for several days during that time eleven hundred prisoners were killed by the people inside the prison dr manette had come before a tribunal which was a group of judges appointed by the people these judges made their own laws and threw prisoners out into the streets to be murdered by the crowds dr manette told the tribunal that he had been a prisoner in the bastille for eighteen years and that his son in law was now a prisoner in la force the tribunal had agreed to keep charles darnay safe from the murdering crowds but they would not let him leave the prison dr manette seemed to become stronger as he lived through these terrible days doing everything he could to save his daughter s husband he was able to see darnay regularly but noblemen and emigrants were hated by the citizens of new france and the doctor could not set darnay free the guillotine that new machine of death cut off the heads of many many people the powerful and the cruel but also the beautiful the innocent and the good each day lucie did not know if her husband would live or die she lived every moment in great fear but her father was sure that he could save his son in law one year and three months passed and darnay was still in prison dr manette now had an official job as doctor to three prisons and was able to visit darnay regularly he became more and more loved by the rough people of the revolution but the guillotine continued to kill try not to worry he told lucie nothing can happen to charles i know that i can save him but lucie could not see him or visit him she could not even write to him on the day when charles darnay was at last called for his trial lucie and dr manette hurried to tellson s bank to tell mr lorry as they arrived a man got up and disappeared into another room they did not see who it was but in fact it was sydney carton just arrived from london there were five judges in the tribunal and the trials were short and simple the voices of truth honesty and calm reason were never heard at these trials and most of the prisoners were sent to the guillotine which pleased the noisy crowds fifteen prisoners were called before darnay that day and in no more than an hour and a half all of them had been condemned to death charles evr monde who is called darnay as darnay walked in front of the judges he tried to remember the careful advice that dr manette had given him charles evr monde you are an emigrant all emigrants must die that is the new law of france kill him shouted the people cut off his head he s an enemy of the people the president of the judges asked darnay is it true that you lived many years in england yes that is true replied darnay so you are an emigrant surely no not in the meaning of the law replied darnay i earn my own living in england i have never wanted or used the name of marquis and i did not want to live by the work of the poor people of france so i went to live and work in england long before the revolution and did you marry in england yes i married a frenchwoman the daughter of dr manette a prisoner of the bastille and a well known friend of all good citizens these words had a happy effect on the crowd those who had shouted for his death now shouted for his life then monsieur gabelle and dr manette spoke for charles darnay the doctor spoke well and clearly and was very popular with the crowd when he had finished the judges decided that the prisoner should be set free and the crowd shouted their agreement loudly soon they were carrying darnay in a chair through the streets of paris to dr manette s house lucie was waiting there and when she ran out and fell into the arms of her husband the men and women in the crowd kissed one another and danced for happiness darnay and lucie were together again safe and happy i told you that i would save him said lucie s father proudly well i have saved him and you must not worry now but lucie was still worried so many innocent men and women had died for no reason and every day brought more deaths a shadow of fear and hate lay over france and no one knew what dangers the next day would bring it was not possible to leave paris at once as charles did not have the necessary papers they must live quietly and hope to leave as soon as they could but that night when dr manette charles and lucie were sitting together they heard a loud knock at the door what can this be said lucie trembling hide charles save him my child said the doctor i have saved him he is a free man but when he opened the door four rough men pushed their way into the room the citizen evr monde where is he he is again the prisoner of the people i am here said darnay but why am i again a prisoner you are accused by citizens of saint antoine dr manette had said nothing he seemed to be made of stone but suddenly he spoke will you tell me who has accused my son in law i shouldn t tell you this said one of the men but citizen evr monde called darnay is accused by monsieur and madame defarge and by one other person what other you will hear that tomorrow replied the man the spy while this was happening miss pross was out shopping for the family jerry cruncher was with her and they had just gone into a wine shop when miss pross suddenly stopped looked at one of the customers and cried out in a loud voice oh solomon dear solomon i ve found you at last dear brother but whatever are you doing here in paris don t call me solomon you ll get me killed pay for your wine and come outside said the man in a low frightened voice they went outside you mustn t recognize me here said the man it s not safe go your way and let me go mine miss pross began to cry at these unbrotherly words and jerry cruncher stepped forward to stare in the man s face wait a minute said jerry is your name john solomon or solomon john your sister calls you solomon i know that your name s john i remember that but your other name wasn t pross at that old bailey trial what was your name then barsad said another voice yes barsad that s it cried jerry he turned round and saw sydney carton standing behind him don t be alarmed my dear miss pross said carton smiling at her but i m afraid i have to tell you that your brother is a spy a spy for the french prisons solomon pross also barsad went pale that s not true i saw you come out of the conciergerie today i followed you said carton and i found out what you do and i ve decided that you may be able to help me come with me to the office of mr lorry after a short argument which carton won barsad followed him to mr lorry s office i boring bad news carton said to mr lorry darnay has been arrested again but i was with him only two hours ago cried mr lorry he was safe and free even so he has been arrested and taken to the conciergerie and i m not sure that dr manette s good name can save him this time so we must have mr barsad s help i will not help you said solomon pross called john barsad oh i think you will said sydney carton when you hear what i could say about you let s think mr barsad is a spy and a prison guard but he used to be a spy in england is he still paid by the english no one will listen to you said barsad but i can say more mr barsad replied carton barsad had more problems than carton knew he could not return to england because he was wanted by the police there and in france before he became a prison guard for the citizens revolution he had been a spy for the king s officers he knew that madame defarge that terrible woman had knitted his name into her list of enemies of the people most of those on her list had already been killed by the guillotine and barsad did not want to be next you seem worried mr barsad said carton calmly the spy turned to mr lorry miss pross is my sister sir would you send her brother to his death sir the best thing for your sister mr barsad said carton smoothly is not to have a brother like you i think i will inform the tribunal that i suspect you of spying for england you will be condemned at once i am sure all right barsad said slowly i ll help you but don t ask me to do anything that will put my life in danger because i won t do it you re a guard at the conciergerie prison where darnay is aren t you said carton come let us talk privately in the next room when mr carton returned alone mr lorry asked what he hsd done not much replied carton but if it goes badly for darnay tomorrow i can visit him once it s all i could do but that will not save him cried mr lorry sadly i never said it would mr lorry was an old man now with a life of hard work behind him tears filled his eyes as he realized he could do nothing to help lucie and her father now sydney carton felt very sorry for mr lorry you re a good friend of dr manette and his daughter but don t tell them about me or this meeting it can t help lucie he paused will you go back to london soon yes my work for tellson s bank here is finished i have the necessary papers to leave paris i was ready to go tomorrow then don t change your plans said carton very seriously later that night sydney carton visited a shop in a quiet corner of paris he wrote on a piece of paper the names of several powders and gave it to the shopkeeper for you citizen asked the shopkeeper yes for me you must be careful citizen keep these things separate you know what happens if you put them together perfectly replied carton he spent the rest of that night walking the streets of paris he watched the moon rise in the sky he listened to the sounds of the river seine flowing through the heart of the city and he thought calmly about the past and the future he thought about all the deaths that the city had already seen and he thought about lucie s gentle loving face and her sad sad eyes the secret paper when charles darnay was led before the tribunal the next morning dr manette lucie and mr lorry were all there the love in lucie s eyes as she looked at her husband warmed darnay s heart it had the same effect on sydney carton though no one saw him standing at the back of the room it was the same tribunal who had let darnay go free on the day before but revolution laws were not as powerful as the anger of the people the president of the tribunal asked who has accused charles evr monde again three voices he was told he is accused by ernest defarge by teresa defarge his wife and by alexandre manette doctor there was a great noise in the room when dr manette s name was heard when the shouting stopped dr manette stood pale and trembling president this cannot be true you know that the man who is accused charles darnay is my daughter s husband my daughter and those who are dear to her are far more important to me than my life where is the liar who says that i accuse my daughter s husband citizen manette said the president be calm nothing can be more important to a good citizen than the freedom of france defarge came forward to answer questions he told how he had been at the bastille at the beginning of the revolution when that hated prison had been taken by the citizens i knew that dr manette had been kept in a room known as one hundred and five north tower it was the only name he had when he came to me in i went to the room and hid den in a hole i found a written paper it is in dr manette s writing read it to us said the president and the crowd fell silent and listened i alexandre manette write this in the bastille in i have been here for ten long years and i write this in my secret moments when i can one evening in december i was walking by the river seine and a coach stopped beside me two men got out and one asked me if i was dr manette when i replied that i was they asked me to go with them and made it clear that i could not refuse the coach left paris and stopped at a lonely house i could hear cries coming from a room upstairs when i went in i saw a young woman lying on a bed she was young and very beautiful she was also very ill she kept crying out my husband my father and my brother then she listened for a moment and began once again my husband my father and my brother i gave the girl something to make her calmer but her feverish screams continued then i turned to question the two men they were clearly brothers and their clothes and voices suggested that they were noblemen but they took care to prevent me from learning their name before i could speak the older brother said carelessly there is another patient in a different room they showed me a boy of about seventeen there was a sword wound in his chest and i could see at once that he was dying how did this happen i asked he s just a crazy young peasant he came here shouting about revenge and made my brother fight him the older brother s voice was cold and hard he seemed to think the boy was less important than a horse or a dog the boy s eyes looked at me have you seen her my sister it was hard for him to speak i have seen her i replied these rich nobles are cruel to us doctor they destroy our land they take our food they steal our sisters my sister loved a man in our village he was sick but she married him to take care of him but my sister is beautiful and that nobleman s brother saw her and wanted her they made her husband work night and day without stopping until he dropped dead where he stood then they took my sister away when my father heard what had happened the news was too much for his poor heart and he died suddenly i took my younger sister to a place where she is safe and came here to find this man he threw some money at me tried to buy me like a dog but i made him pull his sword and fight me to save his life the boy s life was going fast but he cried lift me doctor he turned his face towards the older brother marquis he said loudly i call for you and your brother and all your family now and in the future to pay for what you have done then he fell back dead the young woman s fever continued but i could not save her she lived for several more days and once the marquis said to me how long these peasants take to die when she was dead the brothers warned me to keep silent they offered me money but i refused it and was taken back to my home the next day i decided to write to the king s officials i knew that nobles who did unlawful things were usually not punished and expected that nothing would happen but i did not realize the danger for myself just as i had finished writing my letter a lady came to see me she said she was the wife of the marquis of evr monde and she had discovered what her husband and his brother had done she wanted to help the younger sister of the girl who had died and asked me where she could find her sadly i did not know and so could not tell her but that was how i learnt the brothers name the wife of the marquis was a good kind woman deeply unhappy in her marriage she had brought her son with her a boy about three years old if i cannot find this poor girl she said i shall tell my son to continue the search after my death you will remember that little charles won t you the child answered yes later that day i sent my letter to the king s officials and that night there was a knock at my door my servant a boy called ernest defarge brought in a stranger who asked me to come at once to visit a sick man in the next street as soon as i was outside the house several men took hold of me violently the evr monde brothers came out of the darkness and the marquis took my letter out of his pocket showed it to me and burned it not a word was spoken then i was brought here to this prison my living grave i have been here for ten long years i do not know if my dear wife is alive or dead these brothers have sent me no news of my family there is no goodness in their cruel hearts i alexandre manette in my pain and sadness i condemn them in the face of god when defarge had finished reading a terrible sound rose from the crowd a long wild cry of anger and revenge death for the hated marquis of evr monde enemy of the people the trial was over and in less than twenty four hours charles darnay would go to the guillotine madame defarge s revenge lucie held out her arms to her husband let me kiss him one last time most of the citizens had gone out into the streets to shout how they hated the prisoners but barsad was still there let her kiss her husband he said it s just for a minute lucie went over to her husband and he took her in his arms dr manette followed his daughter and fell on his knees before them but darnay pulled him to his feet saying no no now we know how much you suffered especially when you knew whose son i was but you kept your feelings secret because of your love for lucie we thank you with all our hearts for what you did i tried so hard to do what my mother had wished but i never found that poor girl and how could that terrible story ever have a happy ending he turned to his wife my dearest love we shall meet again in the place where there are no worries god be with you both as darnay was taken away lucie fell to the floor unconscious sydney carton came quickly forward to help mr lorry and dr manette he carried lucie to her coach and she was taken home then he carried her into the house where her daughter and miss pross waited tears falling from their eyes before i go said sydney carton may i kiss her he touched lucie s face lightly with his lips whispered a few words and went into the next room you are still very popular with the citizens doctor you must try again to talk to the judges i ll do everything i can everything dr manette said mr lorry went with carton to the door i have no hope whispered mr lorry sadly nor have i replied carton after today no judge in paris would even try to save him the people would be too angry i will return here later to see if there is any news but there is no real hope he left the house and began to walk quickly towards saint antoine his face was calm and serious he looked like a man who had decided to do something i must show myself to the people here he thought they should know that there is a man like me in the city in defarge s wine shop the only customer was jacques three who had been on the tribunal that had decided darnay should die when carton sat down and asked for a glass of wine madame defarge looked at him carelessly at first then much more carefully she went back to her husband and jacques three who were talking he is very much like evr monde she said softly defarge himself looked at carton and said yes but only a little and the three continued their conversation carton listened carefully while pretending to read a newspaper madame is right said jacques three why should we stop at evr monde we must stop somewhere said defarge not until they are all dead every one of that family said his wife you re right but think how much the doctor has suffered perhaps he has suffered enough listen said madame defarge coldly don t forget that i was that younger sister and it was my family that suffered so much from the evr monde brothers it was my sister who died and my sister s husband and my father it was my brother who was killed tell others to stop don t tell me carton paid for his wine and went out quickly on his way he went back to dr manette s house where more bad news was waiting for him the doctor s mind had returned to the past once again he did not recognize his friends and wanted only to find his old table and to make shoes listen to me carefully carton said to mr lorry i believe that lucie her daughter and perhaps even her father are in great danger i heard madame defange talking about them tonight they must leave paris tomorrow they have the necessary papers and so do you here are mine take them and keep them safe with your own you must leave by coach at two o clock tomorrow keep a place for me in the coach and don t leave without me promise that you will do exactly what i have said many lives will depend on it i promise said mr lorry a change of clothes charles darnay passed his last night alone in the prison he had no hope he knew he must die not for anything he had done wrong but for the crimes of his father and his uncle he sat down to write to his wife i knew nothing about the time your father spent in prison until he told me even then i did not know that it was my family that had been so cruel to him i told your father that my real name was evr monde and he made me promise not to tell you i am sure that he had forgotten the paper he had written but what has happened now is not his fault take care of him and our child and one day we shall all meet again in the happier world that comes after death darnay did not sleep peacefully that night and in the morning he walked up and down his prison waiting he counted the hours nine gone for ever ten eleven twelve gone for ever at one o clock he heard someone outside the door the door opened and closed and there stood sydney carton holding a warning finger to his lips be quiet i come from your wife she begs you to do exactly what i say and to ask no questions there is no time take off your boots and put on mine carton my dear friend said darnay it is impossible to escape from this place you will only die with me i m not asking you to escape put on my shirt and my coat he did not allow darnay time to argue or refuse now sit down and write what i say he said quickly my friend quickly if you remember he said and darnay wrote the words we spoke so long ago you will understand this when you see it as he said this carton took his hand from his pocket what is that in your hand asked darnay nothing have you written see it good now go on writing said carton quietly i am happy that i can prove them now this is not a reason for sadness carton s hand was close to darnay s face and he gently pressed a cloth against darnay s nose and mouth a minute later darnay lay unconscious on the ground carton quickly dressed himself in darnay s clothes and pushed the note that darnay had written inside darnay s pocket then he went to the door and called softly come in now the spy barsad came in quick help me said carton you must help me to the coach you asked the spy him man i ve changed places with him you can say that it was too much for him saying his last goodbye to his friend that happens quite often i believe yes often replied barsad but do you promise to keep me out of danger and go on with this plan to the end the number must be right fifty two prisoners must die today have i not already promised to be true to the death hurry man take him to mr lorry put him in the coach yourself and tell mr lorry to leave at once barsad called two men into the room and told them to lift the unconscious man and carry him out the time is short evr monde said barsad in a warning voice i know it well replied carton be careful with my friend and leave me the door closed and carton was left alone he listened care fully but there were only normal prison sounds no shouts no alarm bells he waited calmly soon he heard the sound of doors opening the door of his prison cell opened and a man said follow me evr monde and carton followed him into a large dark room there were many people there some standing some sitting some walking about some crying most of them stood silent looking at the ground a young woman came up to him she was thin and pale citizen evr monde she said i was with you in la force true he said softly but i forget what you were accused of i am innocent what could a poor little thing like me do i am not afraid to die citizen evr monde but i have done nothing her sad smile as she said this touched carton s heart they say that the revolution will do so much good for the poor people said the girl how can my death help the poor if it is true i am willing to die but i do not know how that can be i heard that you were set free citizen evr monde she went on i hoped it was true it was but i was taken again and condemned when we go from here citizen evr monde will you let me hold your hand i am not afraid but i am little and weak and it will help to make me brave the young girl looked into his face and he saw a sudden doubt come into her eyes followed by surprise he touched his lips with his finger are you dying for him she whispered and his wife and child yes oh will you let me hold your brave hand stranger yes my poor sister to the last the last goodbyes at that same hour in the early afternoon a coach going out of paris drives up to the gates of the city who goes there show us your papers the guard looks at the papers alexandre manette doctor which is he this is dr manette this helpless old man whispering crazily to himself the last few days of the revolution have been too much for him said the guard with a cruel laugh lucie his daughter the wife of evr monde which is she this is she with her child little lucie beside her hah your husband has another meeting today sydney carton lawyer english which is he he is here in the corner he is not well and jarvis lorry banker english which is he i am he and the last says jarvis lorry here are your papers jarvis lorry you may go there are wildly beating hearts in the coach and trembling hands there is the heavy breathing of the unconscious traveller but onwards the coach goes the horses are fast and there are no shouts behind them on the road also that afternoon madame defarge was talking with her friends my husband is a good citizen but he is not strong enough he feels sorry for the doctor i say that all the evr monde people must go to the guillotine the wife and the child must follow the husband they re both fine heads for the guillotine said jacques three their heads will be a pretty sight when they are shown to the people yes they too must die but i m afraid that my husband may warn them and let them escape madame defarge went on and i must do something myself after the death of evr monde at three this afternoon we ll go to the tribunal and accuse them the others agreed willingly no one must escape more heads must fall lucie manette will be at home now waiting for the moment of her husband s death said madame defarge i will go to her she will say things against the revolution and condemn herself here take my knitting and keep my usual seat near the guillotine don t be late said her friend to see the death of evr monde i shall not be late replid the cruel voice of madame defarge there were many women in paris at that time who hated the nobles and wanted to see them die but of all these women madame defarge was the one most feared all her life she had been filled with hate it was nothing to her that an innocent man was going to die because of his father s and his uncle s crimes she wanted more hidden in her clothes were a gun and a sharp knife and with her usual confident step she began to walk to dr manette s house the house was not yet empty miss pross and jerry cruncher were there preparing to follow mr lorry s coach mr lorry had decided that two coaches were better than one with fewer passengers each coach would travel faster but miss pross was still worried a second coach leaving from the house might suggest an escape mr cruncher she said you must go and stop our coach coming here drive to the church instead and i ll meet you there at three o clock jerry hurried away it was twenty past two and at once miss pross began to get herself ready to leave she was washing her face when she suddenly looked up and saw a figure standing in the room madame defarge looked at her coldly the wife of evr monde where is she miss pross quickly stood in front of the door to lucie s room you re a cruel dangerous woman but you won t frighten me she said breathing hard each woman spoke in her own language and neither understood the other s words but madame defarge knew that miss pross was a true friend of the doctor s family and miss pross knew that madame defarge was the family s enemy i wish to see the wife of evr monde go and tell her do you hear me said madame defarge she stared angrily at miss pross but miss pross stared back just as angrily i am desperate said miss pross i know that the longer i can keep you here the greater hope there is for my darling girl if you fight me i ll fight back madame defarge stepped forward and called loudly citizen doctor wife of evr monde answer me there was no answer and madame defarge quickly opened three of the doors and saw that the rooms were empty one door was still closed if they are not in that room they are gone but they can be followed and brought back she went towards the door but miss pross jumped forward and held her round the waist madame defarge was used to the fighting in the streets and was strong but love is stronger than hate and miss pross did not let go madame defarge tried to pull out her knife no said miss pross it s under my arm you shall not have it madame defarge put her hand to the front of her dress and began to pull out the gun miss pross looked down saw what it was and hit out at it wildly there was a loud bang and a cloud of smoke and miss pross stood alone trembling with terror all this in a second as the smoke cleared miss pross saw the lifeless body of madame defarge on the ground in horror she opened her mouth to call for help but then she thought of the dangers this would bring for her dear lucie with shaking hands she got her hat and coat locked the door of the room and went downstairs as she crossed the bridge on the way to the church she dropped the key of the locked room in the river and hurried on to meet jerry cruncher as the death carts carry the condemned prisoners through the streets of paris crowds watch to see the faces of those who are to die in the chairs around the guillotine the friends of madame defarge are waiting for her teresa teresa defarge who has seen her she s never missed before but the death carts have arrived and the guillotine has already begun its work crash a head is held up and the women who sit knitting count one the supposed evr mode helps the young girl down from the cart he carefully places her with her back to the guillotine and she looks up gratefully into his face because of you dear stranger i am calm i think you were sent to me by god she whispers or perhaps he sent you to me says sydney carton keep your eyes on me dear child and do not think of anything else i do not mind while i hold your hand i shall not mind when i let it go if they are quick they are quick fear not she kisses his lips he kisses hers now the guillotine is waiting the young girl goes next before him the women count twenty two and carton walks forward twenty three they said of him that it was the most peaceful face ever seen there what passed through sydney carton s mind as he walked those last steps to his death perhaps he saw into the future i see barsad defarge the judges all dying under this terrible machine i see a beautiful city being built in this terrible place i see that new people will live here in real freedom i see the lives for whom i give my life happy and peaceful in that england which i shall never see again i see lucie when she is old crying for me on this day every year and i know that she and her husband remember me until their deaths i see their son who has my name now a man i see him become a famous lawyer and make my name famous by his work i hear him tell his son my story it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com the case begins the september sun was shining brightly into the win dows of b baker street and london was enjoying a beautiful late summer i had finished my breakfast and was reading the newspaper as usual holmes had got up late and was still eating we were expecting a visitor at half past ten and i wondered whether holmes would finish his breakfast be fore our visitor arrived holmes was in no hurry he was reading once again a letter he had received three days ago it was from dr james mortimer who asked for an appointment with holmes well watson holmes said to me i m afraid that a doc tor from devonshire won t bring us anything of real interest his letter doesn t tell us anything about his business though he says it s very important i hope we can help him at exactly half past ten there was a knock on our front door good said holmes dr mortimer is clearly a man who will not waste our time we stood up as our visitor was brought into the room good morning gentlemen he said i m dr james mor timer from grimpen in devonshire and i think you must be mr sherlock holmes he shook hands with holmes who said how do you do dr mortimer may i introduce my good friend dr john watson who helps me with my cases i hope you will allow him to listen to our conversation of course said mortimer as he turned to me and shook hands i need your help very badly mr holmes if it will be useful for dr watson to hear what i have to say please let him stay and listen mortimer did not look like a country doctor he was very tall and thin he had a long thin nose his grey eyes were bright and he wore gold glasses his coat and trousers were old and worn his face was young but his shoulders were bent like an old man s and his head was pushed forward he took some pa pers from his pocket and said mr holmes i need your help and advice something very strange and frightening has been happening sit down dr mortimer said holmes and tell us your problem i ll help you if i can the baskerville papers these papers were given to me by sir charles baskerville said dr mortimer he asked me to take good care of them you may remember that sir charles died suddenly three months ago his death caused much excite ment in devonshire the county where baskerville hall is sir charles was a sensible man but he believed the story which is told in these papers dr mortimer went on the story is about the baskerville family i have come to see you because i need your help i think that something terrible is going to happen in the next twenty four hours but you can t help me unless you know the story in these papers may i read them to you please continue dr mortimer said holmes and sat back in his chair with his eyes shut mortimer began to read in his high rather strange voice i william baskerville write this for my sons in the year my father told me about the hound of the baskervilles he told me when it was first seen and i believe his story was true i want you my sons to read this story carefully i want you to know that god punishes those who do evil but never forget that he will forgive those who are sorry for any evil they have done over a hundred years ago in the head of the baskerville family was sir hugo baskerville he was a wild and evil man he was cruel and enjoyed hurting peo ple sir hugo fell in love with the daughter of a farmer who was a neighbour of his the young woman was afraid of the evil hugo and avoided him one day hugo heard that her father and brothers were away he knew that she would be alone so he rode to the farm with five or six of his evil friends they made the girl go back to baskerville hall with them and locked her in a room upstairs then they sat down in the great dining hall to drink as usual they drank bottle after bottle and soon they began to sing and laugh and shout evil words the girl upstairs who was already very frightened felt desperate when she heard the terrible things they were shouting so she did a very brave thing she opened the window climbed out of the room and down the ivy on the wall then she started to run across the moor towards her home a little while later hugo left his friends and went upstairs to the room to take her some food and drink when he found an open window and an empty room he behaved like a man who was mad he ran down the stairs he screamed that he would give himself to the devil if he caught the girl before she reached home some of hugo s drunken friends told him to let the hounds chase her and so he ran from the house and unlocked the dogs then he jumped onto his black horse and rode off over the moor with the hounds running and crying around him hugo s friends fetched their horses and followed him there were thirteen of them after a mile or two they passed an old farmer and asked him if he had seen sir hugo and the hounds the man looked half mad with fear and spoke with difficulty he said that he had seen the girl and the hounds running close behind her sir hugo had been riding just behind the hounds but i have seen more than that the old man said behind sir hugo i saw a huge and terrible hound running silently may god keep me safe from that hound of hell the thirteen men laughed at the old man and rode on but their laughter soon stopped when they saw sir hugo s horse running wildly towards them without a rider the thirteen men moved closer together as they rode on they were suddenly afraid over the moor they went until at last they caught up with the hounds everyone in the county knew that the baskerville hounds were brave and strong but now they were standing at the head of a deep valley in the moor with their ears and tails down they were very frightened hugo s friends stopped most of them would not go on but three were brave enough to go down into the valley the valley had a wide flat floor in the middle of the flat ground stood two great stones they had stood there for thousands of years the moon was shining brightly on the great stones and between them on the flat ground lay the girl she had fallen there dead of fear and exhaustion sir hugo s body was lying near her but it was not the sight of sir hugo or the girl that filled the men with fear it was the sight of the huge animal that was standing over sir hugo its teeth were at his throat it was a great black creature that looked like a hound but it was larger than any hound they had ever seen as they watched it tore out hugo baskerville s throat then it turned towards them its eyes were burning brightly its body shone with a strange light blood ran from its mouth the men screamed and kicked their horses they rode back up the valley as fast as they could go later that night one died from the horror he had seen the other two were mad for the rest of their lives that was the first time the hound appeared my sons it has been seen many times since then and many of the baskervilles have died in strange and terrible ways because of this i warn you not to cross the moors at night the devil finds it easy to do his work when the world is dark how sir charles died when dr mortimer had finished reading this strange story he looked across at sherlock holmes holmes looked bored did you find the story interesting asked dr mortimer it may interest a collector of stories to frighten children said holmes dr mortimer took a newspaper from another pocket now mr holmes let me read you something which was written only three months ago it is from the devonshire county newspaper and it is about the death of sir charles baskerville holmes looked more interested dr mortimer began to read the sudden death of sir charles baskerville has caused great sadness in the county although he had lived at baskerville hall for only two years everyone liked him sir charles had lived abroad and made his money there he came back to spend his fortune on repairing baskerville hall and its farms and villages as the buildings and lands were in very poor condition he was a friendly and generous man who gave freely to the poor the official report of his death does not explain every thing that happened however it does show that there was no question of murder sir charles died from natural causes and the strange stories people are telling about his death are not true his friend and doctor dr james mor timer said that sir charles heart had been weak for some time the facts are simple every night before going to bed sir charles went for a walk in the gardens of baskerville hall his favourite walk was down a path between two hedges of yew trees the famous yew alley of baskerville hall on the night of th june he went out for his walk to think and to smoke his usual cigar sir charles was going to london on the next day and barrymore his butler was packing his suitcases by midnight barrymore was worried that sir charles had not re turned so he went to look for him he found the door of the hall open the day had been rainy and wet so barry more saw the prints left by sir charles shoes as he had walked down the alley half way down the alley is a gate which leads to the moor there were signs that sir charles had stood there for some time barrymore fol lowed the footprints to the far end of the alley and there he found sir charles body barrymore reported something interesting about the footprints he said that they changed between the moor gate and the end of the alley as far as the moor gate there was a whole footprint for each of sir charles steps after he passed the gate only toe prints could be seen barrymore thought that sir charles had walked on his toes a man called murphy who buys and sells horses was not far away at the time of sir charles death he had been drinking a lot of beer but he says he heard cries he is not sure where they came from dr mortimer was called to look at sir charles body there were no signs that sir charles had been murdered but dr mortimer did not recognize his friend s face the whole shape of it was changed however this often hap pens with deaths which are caused by weak hearts when dr mortimer looked at the body he found that this was in fact what had happened sir charles weak heart had failed and this had caused his death everyone hopes that the new head of the baskerville family will move quickly into the hall sir charles good work must go on the new head of the baskerville family will be sir henry baskerville if he is still alive and if the lawyers can find him he is the son of sir charles baskerville s younger brother who died some years ago the young man has been living in the usa the baskerville lawyers are trying to contact him to tell him about his good fortune dr mortimer put the newspaper back into his pocket those are the official facts about the death of sir charles they are the facts that everyone knows mr holmes he said thank you for informing me about this interesting case holmes said i read about it at the time but i heard none of the details the newspaper gives the facts that everybody knows now i want you to tell me all the other facts that you know what do you know about the strange stories i haven t told anyone these other facts said dr mortimer i am a man of science as you know i have always believed that there are sensible explanations for everything i didn t want to say anything that could stop sir henry from coming to live at the hall but i will tell you tile details that were not in the report in the months before his death dr mortimer went on sir charles was a very worried man he was near to breaking down he believed the story of the hound of the baskervilles he refused to go out at night he often asked me whether i had seen any strange animal or heard the cry of a hound on the moor at night he always got very excited when he asked this question i remember driving up to the hall one evening about three weeks before he died he was standing at the door i went up to him and saw him staring at something behind me there was a look of horror on his face i turned quickly and saw something moving between the trees it looked like a small black cow he was so frightened that i went to look for the animal it had disappeared but sir charles was very worried i stayed with him all the evening it was then he gave me the old papers i have read to you what i saw that evening may be important when you consider what happened on the night of his death when barrymore the butler found sir charles body he sent someone to fetch me i checked all the facts i have just read them to you and they are all true but barrymore said one thing that was not true he said that there were no other prints on the ground around the body he did not notice any but i did they were not close to the body but they were fresh and clear footprints asked holmes yes footprints said mortimer a man s or a woman s asked holmes dr mortimer looked at us strangely for a moment his voice became a whisper as he answered mr holmes they were the footprints of a huge hound the problem ifelt a moment of fear as mortimer spoke these words holmes sat forward in his excitement and his eyes showed he was very interested indeed why did nobody else see these footprints he asked the footprints were about twenty metres from the body and nobody thought of looking so far away mortimer replied are there many sheep dogs on the moor asked holmes yes but this was no sheep dog the footprints were very large indeed enormous mortimer answered but it had not gone near the body no what kind of night was it holmes asked it was wet and cold though it wasn t actually raining describe the alley to me the alley is a path between two long yew hedges the hedges are small trees that were planted very close together they are about four metres high the distance between the two yew hedges is about seven metres down the middle is a path of small stones the path is about three metres wide with grass on each side of it i understand there is a gate through the hedge in one place said holmes yes there is a small gate which leads to the moor is there any other opening through the hedge no so you can enter or leave the yew alley only from the hall or through the moor gate asked holmes there is a way out through a summer house at the far end had sir charles reached the summer house no he lay about fifty metres from it said mortimer now dr mortimer this is important you say that the footprints you saw were on the path and not on the grass no footprints could show on the grass said mortimer were they on the same side of the path as the moor gate yes they were i find that very interesting indeed another question was the moor gate closed yes it was closed and locked how high is it asked holmes it is just over a metre high then anyone could climb over it yes what prints did you see by the moor gate sir charles seems to have stood there for five or ten min utes said mortimer i know that because his cigar had burned down and the ash had dropped twice off the end of it excellent said holmes this man is a very good detective watson sir charles had left his footprints all over that little bit of the path where he was standing i couldn t see any other prints sherlock holmes hit his knee with his hand angrily i like to look closely at these things myself he said oh dr mortimer why didn t you call me immediately mr holmes the best detective in the world can t help with some things said mortimer you mean things that are outside the laws of nature supernatural things asked holmes i didn t say so exactly replied mortimer but since sir charles died i have heard about a number of things that seem to be supernatural several people have seen an animal on the moor that looks like an enormous hound they all agree that it was a huge creature which shone with a strange light like a ghost i have questioned these people carefully they are all sensible people they all tell the same story although they have only seen the creature far away it is exactly like the hellhound of the baskerville story the people are very frightened and only the bravest man will cross the moor at night and you a man of science believe that the creature is supernatural something from another world asked holmes i don t know what to believe said dr mortimer but you must agree that the footprints were made by a living creature not a ghost when the hound first appeared two hundred and fifty years ago it was real enough to tear out sir hugo s throat but it was a supernatural hell hound said dr mortimer if you think that sir charles death was caused by some thing supernatural my detective work can t help you said holmes rather coldly perhaps said mortimer but you can help me by advising me what to do for sir henry baskerville he arrives in lon don by train in exactly dr mortimer looked at his watch one hour and a quarter sir henry is now head of the baskerville family asked holmes yes said dr mortimer he is the last of the baskervilles the family lawyers contacted him in the usa he has come to england immediately by ship he landed this morning now mr holmes what do you advise me to do with him why should he not go to the family home asked holmes because so many baskervilles who go there die horrible deaths but sir charles good work must go on if it doesn t all the people on the baskerville lands will be much poorer if the baskerville family leaves the hall that is what will happen i don t know what to do that is why i came to you for advice holmes though for a little while then he said you think it is too dangerous for any baskerville to live at the hall because of this supernatural hell hound well i think you should go and meet sir henry baskerville say nothing to him about this i shall give you my advice in twenty four hours at ten o clock tomorrow morning dr mortimer i would like you to bring sir henry baskerville here dr mortimer got up from his chair as he was leaving the room holmes said one more question dr mortimer you said that before sir charles death several people saw this strange creature on the moor three people did said mortimer did anyone see it after the death i haven t heard of anyone thank you dr mortimer good morning after mortimer had left us holmes sat down in his chair he looked pleased he always looked pleased when a case interest ed him i knew that he needed to be alone to think about all that he had heard i went out for the day and came back to find the room full of thick smoke from holmes pipe what do you think of this case i asked him it is hard to say take for example the change in the foot prints did sir charles walk on his toes down the alley only a stupid person is likely to believe that the truth is he was run ning running for his life he ran until his heart stopped and he fell dead what was he running from i asked that is the difficult question said holmes i think he was mad with fear before he began to run he didn t know what he was doing that explains why he ran away from the house instead of towards it he was running away from help the next question who was he waiting for that night and why was he waiting in the yew alley and not in the house you think he was waiting for someone sir charles was old and unwell we can understand why he took a walk each evening but why did he stand in the cold on wet ground for five or ten minutes dr mortimer cleverly noted the cigar ash so we know how long sir charles stood there we know that he kept away from the moor so it s un likely that he waited at the moor gate every evening i am be ginning to understand some things watson but i ll think no more about it until we meet dr mortimer and sir henry baskerville in the morning please give me my violin and holmes began to play his violin he had done all the thinking he could now he needed more details of the case to help him sir henry baskerville dr mortimer and sir henry baskerville arrived at exact ly ten o clock the following morning sir henry was a small healthy well built man his face showed that he had a strong character he wore a country suit of thick red brown material and his skin showed that he spent most of his time in the open air i am glad this meeting was already arranged sir henry said after we had shaken hands with our visitors i need your help mr holmes a strange thing happened to me this morning look at this letter he put a piece of paper on the table on it were the words do not go on to the moor if you do your life will be in dan ger the words had been cut out of a newspaper can you tell me mr holmes what this means and who is so interested in me sir henry asked this is very interesting said holmes look how badly it has been done i think the writer was in a hurry why per haps because he did not want somebody to see him i think the address was written in a hotel the pen and the ink have both given the writer trouble the pen has run dry three times in writing a short address there was probably very little ink in the bottle a private pen and bottle of ink are never allowed to get into that condition hullo what s this he was holding the letter only a few centimetres from his eyes well i ashed nothing he said and threw the letter down now sir henry have you anything else to tell us no said sir henry except that i have lost one of my shoes i put a pair outside my door last night i wanted the hotel to clean them but when i went to get them this morning one had gone i only bought them yesterday and i have never worn them but i wanted a good shine on them one shoe seems a useless thing to steal said holmes i am sure the shoe will be found in the hotel and returned to you but now we must tell you some things about the baskerville family dr mortimer took out the old baskerville papers and read them to sir henry holmes then told him about the death of sir charles so this letter is from someone who is trying to warn me or frighten me away said sir henry yes said holmes and we have to decide if it is sensible for you to go to baskerville hall there seems to be danger there for you there is no man or devil who will stop me from going to the home of my family said sir henry angrily i want some time to think about what you have told me will you and dr watson join me for lunch at my hotel in two hours time by then i ll be able to tell you what i think dr mortimer and sir henry said goodbye and decided to walk back to their hotel as soon as our visitors had gone holmes changed from the talker to the man of action quick watson your coat and hat we must follow them we got ready quickly and went into the street our friends were not far ahead of us and we followed we stayed about a hundred metres behind them suddenly holmes gave a cry i saw a taxi driving along very slowly on the other side of the road from our friends that s our man watson come along we ll have a good look at him i saw a man with a large black beard looking out of the taxi window he had been following and watching our friends but when he saw us running towards him he shouted something to the driver and the taxi drove off quickly down the road holmes looked round for another taxi but could not see one he began to run after the first taxi but it was soon out of sight well i got the number of the taxi said holmes so i can find the driver he may be able to tell us something about his passenger would you recognize the man if you saw him again only his beard i said he wanted us to recognize the beard said holmes i think it was a false one more mystery later we went on to sir henry s hotel he was pleased to see us but rather angry because another of his shoes had disappeared this time it was one shose of an old pair i could see that holmes found this both interesting and strange he thought about it for a few moments but said nothing except that he did not understand why a second shoe had been stolen at lunch sir henry told holmes that he had decided to go to baskerville hall i think you have decided to do the right thing said holmes i know somebody is following you if someone tries to harm you in london it will be hard to stop him or catch him afterwards in the country we have a better chance holmes went on to tell them about what we had seen that morning then he asked dr mortimer if anyone with a large black beard lived in or near baskerville hall yes said dr mortimer barrymore sir charles butler has a black heard we must check whether barrymore is in london or at baskerville hall said holmes i shall send a telegram to bar rymore at the hall which will say is everything ready for sir henry then i ll send another telegram to the local post of fice this one will say please put telegram to mr barrymore into his own hand if he is away please return telegram to sir henry baskerville i ll give your address at this hotel we shall know before evening whether barrymore is in devonshire or not barrymore and his wife have a very fine home and nothing to do while the family is not living in the hall said sir henry that s true said holmes did the barrymores receive anything from sir chades will and did they know that they would get some money when he died yes said dr mortimer they each received and sir charles told everyone what he had written in his will that s very interesting said holmes i hope you don t suspect everyone who got something from the will said dr mortimer i received indeed said holmes and who else received money a lot of people received a little money he gave a lot of money to a number of hospitals the rest all went to sir henry who received i had no idea it was so much said holmes in surprise the baskerville lands are worth about one million pounds dr mortimer said dear me said holmes a man could kill for that much one more question if something happened to our young friend here who would get baskerville hall and all its lands well as you know sir charles had two brothers sir henry is the only son of sir charles younger brother the youngest brother of the three roger was a criminal the police wanted him so he had to leave england they say he looked exactly like the family picture of old sir hugo who first saw the hound he was the same kind of man too he went to south america where he died of a fever so if sir henry died baskerville hall would go to james desmond who is a cousin of the baskervilles james desmond is an old man who lives in the north of england his life is very simple and he would not want to be rich thank you dr mortimer said holmes now sir henry i agree that you should go to baskerville hall as quickly as pos sible but you must not go alone i myself cannot leave london at the present time i am working on another case i am trying to save one of the most important men in england from a diffi cult situation i hope my friend watson will go with you if there is danger you could not have a better man by your side sir henry and i were both very happy with this idea so we arranged to travel to devonshire on the following saturday just as we were leaving sir henry s room he gave a cry and got down on his knees by the table here s my brown shoe that was lost he said reaching un der the table that s very strange said dr mortimer we both searched the room before lunch and it wasn t under the table then none of the people who worked at the hotel could explain how the shoe had got back into the room so we had another mystery on the way back to baker street in the taxi holmes sat thinking deeply all through the afternoon and the evening he went on thinking silently and smoking pipe after pipe just before dinner a telegram arrived it was from sir henry and said have just heard that barrymore is at the hall so we don t have the answer to the mystery of the man with the beard said holmes but perhaps we shall soon have an answer to another question at that moment the door bell rang it was the driver of the bearded man s taxi i got a message that you wanted to see me said the driver i hope there s nothing wrong no no my good man said holmes in fact i ll give you some money if you can answer my questions clearly tell me all about the man in your taxi this morning he was watching this house at ten o clock and then told you to follow the two gentlemen who came out of it the taxi driver was surprised at how much holmes seemed to know he answered the man told me that he was a detec tive and that i should say nothing about him to anyone this is a serious business said holmes and you will be in trouble if you try to hide anything what can you tell me the man told me his name said the driver holmes looked like a man who has just won an important game that was not very clever of him he said what was his name his name said the taxi driver was sherlock holmes i have never seen my friend look more surprised then he laughed loudly tell me where be got into your taxi and everything that happened we already knew most of what the taxi driver told us but we learned that after we had lost sight of the taxi it had gone to waterloo station where the man had caught his train the taxi driver said that the man was well dressed and had a black beard and pale face he was about forty and not very tall the driver did not know the colour of the man s eyes holmes gave the man a pound and sent him away then he said we have a very clever enemy watson he is winning the game at the moment we have no answers at all to the strange things that have happened in london i hope you are more successful at baskerville hall but i am not happy about sending you there there is too much danger in this case baskerville hall holmes came to waterloo station to say goodbye to us our friends told him that they were sure nobody had followed them since our last meeting sir henry s other shoe had not reappeared holmes repeated his warning that sir hen ry should not go on the moor at night and should not go anywhere alone then holmes checked with me that i had my gun an army revolver the journey was fast and enjoyable we were met at new town station and driven to baskerville hall the countryside we drove through was beautiful but behind it we could see the long dark frightening hills of the moor as we turned a corner we were surprised to see a soldier on horseback he was carrying a gun dr mortimer asked our driver why the soldier was there a dangerous criminal has escaped from the prison sir he told us he s been free for three days now and people are frightened his name is selden he s the man who did that murder in london i remembered the case well it had been a very cruel murder i thought of this killer out on the empty wild moor and i felt more and more uncomfortable about my surroundings the beautiful green fields with their thick hedges were behind us and we were now on the cold open moor everything was grey hard and wild huge rough stones stood on the hard ground the tops of the hills stood sharply like cruel teeth against the sky a cold wind was blowing and night was falling i saw sir henry pull his coat closer round him at last we reached the gates of baskerville hall from the gates a long dark road led up to the house with the black shapes of old trees on each side of it at the end of this road we could see the great house standing with a pale light round it like a ghost i can understand why my uncle felt that trouble was com ing to him here it s not a welcoming place said sir henry and his voice shook as he spoke as we got closer we could see that the hall was a heavy dark building with a large main entrance most of the building was old and was covered in dark green ivy but some of it had been built more recently and was of grim black stone a dull light shone through the heavy windows black smoke was com ing from one of the high chimneys of the main building welcome sir henry welcome to baskerville hall barrymore the butler and his wife were waiting on the steps at the main entrance they came down and took our suit cases into the house dr mortimer left us to go home and we went into the hall where a fire was burning it was a fine room large and high it s exactly as i imagined an old family home sir henry said barrymore showed us to our rooms he was a tall handsome man with a full black beard after we had washed and changed our clothes he brought us to dinner the dining room was not very welcoming it needed more lights to make it brighter on the walls were the pictures of the baskervilles of the past they looked down on us silently and did nothing to make us feel happier after dinner we went to our rooms before i got into bed i looked out of my window a strong wind sang sadly as it bent the trees in front of the hall a half moon shone through the dark flying clouds onto the wild and empty moor i could not sleep then suddenly in the middle of the night i heard very clearly the sound of a woman crying it was the crying of a person who was hurt by some deep sadness the sound was not far away and was certainly in the house the stapletons of pen house the next morning was sunny and we were much more cheerful i told sir henry about the crying i had heard he rang the bell to call barrymore and asked him if he could explain the crying barrymore s face went white when he heard sir henry s question there are only two women in the house sir henry he answered one is the maid who sleeps on the other side of the house the other is my wife and she was certainly not crying but he was telling a lie i saw mrs barrymore after breakfast the sun was full on her face and it was clear she had been crying why had barrymore lied what deep sadness had made his wife cry there was a mystery surrounding this blackbearded handsome man was it possible that barrymore was in fact the man who had been watching sir henry in london i decided i must check with the local post office that the tele gram had really been put into barrymore s own hands while sir henry worked at some papers i walked to the post office it was in the nearest village which was called grimpen i spoke to the boy who had taken the telegram to the hall did you give it to mr barrymore himself i asked well the boy said he was working upon the roof so i couldn t give it to him i gave it to mrs barrymore and she promised to give it to him at once did you see mr barrymore i asked him no said the boy but why did his wife say he was upon the roof if he wasn t it was hopeless to ask any more questions it was clear that holmes cleverness with the telegram had not given us the proof we needed i was walking away from the post office when i heard someone running after me a voice called me by name and i turned i expected to see dr mortimer as i knew nobody else in the village to my surprise it was a stranger he was a small thin man between thirty and forty years old with fair hair and no beard he was carrying a butterfly net and a box for putting butterflies in i hope you will excuse me for introducing myself dr wat son he said as he came up to me my name is stapleton i was in dr mortimer s house and we saw you he told me who you are may i walk along with you this path back to the hall goes near my home pen house please come in and meet my sister and spend an hour with us i accepted stapleton s invitation and we walked together i know that you are a close friend of sherlock holmes said stapleton has mr holmes any ideas about sir charles death i m afraid i can t answer that question i said will mr holmes visit us himself he asked he can t leave london at the moment i answered i was rather surprised that he was asking me these questions we walked on stapleton told me that he and his sister had lived in devonshire for only two years they had moved there soon after sir charles had begun to live in baskerville hall he also talked about the moor and how it interested him he told me to look across the moor to a place which was a bright green colour that is the great grimpen marsh he said if animals or men go into the marsh they will sink into it and die but i can find my way to the very centre of it look there is another of those poor horses something brown was fighting to get out of the bright green of the marsh then a terrible cry came across the moor the horse s head and neck disappeared under the green it s gone stapleton said the marsh has caught and killed it that often happens it is an evil place the great grimpen marsh but you say you can go safely in and out of it i asked him yes there are a few paths and i have found them the low hills you can see are like islands surrounded by the marsh that is where i can find the unusual plants and butterflies and that s why i found my way through the marsh i shall try my luck one day i said he looked at me in surprise please don t try he said you would never return alive and it would be my fault listen i said what is that a long low cry very deep and very sad came over the moor it filled the whole air then it died away what is it i asked with a cold fear in my heart stapleton had a strange look on his face the people say it s the hound of the baskervilles which is calling for some thing to hunt and kill i ve heard it once or twice before but never so loud you are a man of science i said you don t believe that do you isn t there a natural explanation for the sound a marsh makes strange noises sometimes it is the water and the wet ground moving but that was the voice of a living creature i said well perhaps it was there are some very unusual birds on the moors it was most probably the cry of one of those at that moment a small butterfly flew across the path in front of us excuse me dr watson shouted stapleton and ran off to try to catch the butterfly he ran quickly and fol lowed the butterfly on to the marsh but he knew exactly where he could go and was not in any danger as i watched him i heard the sound of steps behind me i turned and saw a woman near me on the path i was sure she was miss stapleton she was very beautiful she was dark and tall with a lovely face before i could say anything she said go back go straight back to london immediately i can not tell you why but please do what i ask you and never come near the moor again but my brother is coming not a word to him stapleton had caught the butterfly and was walking bath to us hello my dear he said to his sister but it seemed to me that his voice was not completely friendly i see that you two have already introduced yourselves yes she said i was telling sir henry that it was rather late in the year for him to see the true beauty of the moor i am sorry i said you have made a mistake i m not sir henry i am a friend who is visiting him and my name is dr watson miss stapleton was clearly angry with herself i m sorry she said please forget what i said but do come with us to our house the house was lonely and rather grim i wondered why the two of them had come to live so far away from anyone else stapleton seemed to know what i was thinking and said you may think this a lonely strange place to live but the moors are very interesting and we enjoy it here i owned a school in the north of england but i had to close it i miss the boys and girls but thefe is plenty to do here and we have good neighbours i hope sir henry will become one of tnem may i visit the hall this afternoon to meet him do you think i m sure he will be very pleased to meet you i said i must go back to the hall now and i shall tell him immediately i said goodbye to the stapletons and continued on the path back to the hall i had been walking for only a few minutes when i was surprised to see miss stapleton sitting on a rock ahead of me she was breathing quickly and i realized she had run by a quicker way to get ahead of me dr watson she said i want to say sorry for the mistake i made i thought you were sir henry please forget what i said i did not mean you were in danger now i must go or my brother will miss me i cannot forget your words miss stapleton i said if sir henry is in danger i must tell him you know the story of the hound she asked me yes but i do not believe it i replied but i think it s true she said please persuade sir henry to leave this place so many of his family have died here mysteriously he must not put his life in danger by staying here sir henry won t leave this place without a real reason i said i can t give you a real reason i don t know anything for certain one more question miss stapleton i said the story of the hound is well known why didn t you want your brother to hear what you said my brother wants the head of the baskerville family to live in the hall she said he wants sir henry to continue the good work that sir charles began he doesn t want sir henry to go and live in another place so he doesn t want me to talk about the hound i must go now or my brother will guess i have been speaking to you goodbye she turned and went back towards her house and i walked on to baskerville hall the escaped prisoner mr stapleton came to the hall and met sir henry that same afternoon the next morning he took us to the place where the evil sir hugo died then we had lunch at the house sir henry clearly thought miss stapleton was very beautiful his eyes followed her everywhere he liked her very much and i was sure that she felt the same about him he spoke about her again and again as we walked home after the first meeting we met the stapletons almost every day after a short time it was clear that sir henry had fallen deeply in love with the beautiful miss stapleton at first i thought that stapleton would be very pleased if his sister mar ried sir henry however i soon realized that he did not want their friendship to grow into love he did everything he could to make sure that they were never alone on one or two occa sions they did manage to meet alone but stapleton followed them and was not pleased to see them together i soon met another neighbour of sir henry s his name was mr frankland and he lived about four miles to the south of the hall he was an old man with a red face and white hair he had two hobbies the first was arguing he argued with everybody the second hobby was studying the stars for this he had a very big telescope for several days he had been watching the moor through the telescope he wanted to find selden the escaped murderer nobody had seen the prisoner for a fortnight and we all thought that he had probably left the moor a few nights later i was woken by a noise at about two in the morning i heard someone walking softly outside my door i got up opened the door and looked out i saw barrymore moving carefully and quietly away from me i followed him as quietly as i could he went into one of the empty bedrooms and left the door open i went quietly up to the door and looked in side barrymore was standing at the window he was holding a light in his hand and looking out onto the moor he stood without moving for a few minutes and then he put out the light i went quickly back to my room a few minutes later i heard barrymore go softly by the next morning i told sir henry what i had seen we must follow him and find out what he is doing said sir henry he won t hear us if we move carefully that night we sat in sir henry s room and waited at about three o clock in the morning we heard the sound of footsteps outside the bedroom we looked out and saw barrymore we followed him as quietly as we could he went into the same room as before we reached the door and looked in there was barrymore with the light in his hand looking out across the moor exactly as i had seen him on the night before sir henry walked into the room and said what are you doing here barrymore barrymore turned round quickly surprise and horror on his face nothing sir he said the shadows on the wall from his light were jumping up and down as his hand shook it was the window sir i go round at night to see that they are closed and this one wasn t shut come now barrymore said sir henry no lies what were you doing with that light you were holding it up to the window i suddenly had an idea i think he was sending a message i said let s see if there s an answer from someone on the moor i held the light up to the window and looked out into the darkness suddenly a light answered from the moor there it is i cried i waved my light backwards and for wards across the window the light on the moor answered by moving in the same way now barrymore who is your friend on the moor what s going on that s my business said barrymore i won t tell you are you making some criminal plan against me sir henry said no it s nothing against you sir said a voice behind us it was mrs barrymore she had followed us and was standing at the door he s doing it for me my unhappy brother is cold and hungry on the moor we cannot let him die our light is to tell him that food is ready for him his light shows us where to take it then your brother is began sir henry the escaped prisoner sir selden the murderer he is my younger brother he has done evil things but to me he is still the little boy i loved and cared for i had to help him every thing my husband has done has been for me please don t take his job from him it s not his fault sir henry turned to barrymore and said i cannot blame you for helping your wife go to bed and we ll talk about this in the morning the barrymores left us the murderer is waiting out there by that light said sir henry he s a danger to everyone i m going to catch him if you want to come with me watson fetch your revolver and let s go we left the hall immediately we must surprise him and catch him said sir henry he s a dangerous man now watson what would holmes say about this do you remember what the old papers said they said the devil does his work when the world is dark just as he spoke there came a strange cry from across the moor it was the same cry i had heard when i was with staple ton on the edge of the great grimpen marsh what is that noise asked sir henry he stopped and put his hand on my arm to hold me back i ve heard it before i said stapleton says it s the cry of a bird watson said sir henry his voice shaking it is the cry of a hound what do the local people say it is they say it is the cry of the hound of the baskervilles i replied can there possibly be some truth in the story said sir henry am i really in danger from such an evil thing i think i am as brave as most men but that sound froze my blood but we have come out to catch that prisoner and the devil himself will not make me turn back it was difficult to cross the moor in the dark but at last we reached the light it was standing on a rock suddenly an evil face more like an animal than a man looked at us from behind the rock the escaped prisoner saw us and screamed as he turned to run sir henry and i were both good runners and very healthy men but we soon realized that we had no chance of catching selden he knew the way and was running for his life soon we had lost him in the dark so we stopped and sat down breathing heavily to rest at that moment a very strange thing happened the moon was low upon our right and in its light we could see the top of a hill on that hill with the moon behind him stood a tall thin man he was standing perfectly still he was watching us it was not selden who had been running away from that hill this man was much taller with a cry of surprise i turned to sir henry as i turned the man disappeared i wanted to go across to the hill and search for him but we were tired and i remembered that sir henry might be in dan ger so we went back to baskerville hall who was the tall man i had seen standing against the moon was he an enemy or a friend who was watching over us i wished more and more that holmes could leave london and come to baskerville hall i wrote to him every few days and gave him the details of everything that happened and everyone i met the letter the following day was dull and foggy the hall was sur rounded by heavy low clouds which opened now and then to show the grim cold moor and its wet grey rocks the weather made us miserable it was difficult to be cheerful when we felt danger all around us i thougth of sir charles death and the awful sound of the hound which i had now heard twice holmes did not believe that there was a supernatural hound but facts are facts and i had heard a hound was there a huge hound living on the moor if so where could it hide where did it get its food why was it never seen by day it was almost as difficult to accept a natural explanation as a su pernatural explanation that morning sir henry and barrymore argued about selden the escaped prisoner barrymore said that it was wrong to try to catch selden but the man is dangerous said sir henry he ll do anything nobody is safe until he is in prison again we must tell the police i promise he won t break into any house said barrymore and he won t cause any trouble in a few days he will catch a boat for south america please don t tell the police about him if you tell the police my wife and i will be in serious trouble what do you say watson asked sir henry turning to me i don t think he will break into houses or cause trouble if he did the police would know where to look for him and would catch him he s not a stupid man i hope you re right said sir henry i m sure we re breaking the law but i don t want to get barrymore and his wife into trouble so i shall not tell the police i shall leave selden in peace barrymore could not find the words to thank sir henry enough then he said you have been so kind to us that i want to do something for you in return i have never told anyone else i know something more about poor sir charles death sir henry and i jumped up at once do you know how he died sir henry asked no sir i don t know that but i know why he was waiting at the gate he was going to meet a woman sir charles was meeting a woman who was the woman i don t know her name barrymore said but it begins with l l how do you know this barrymore i asked well sir charles got a letter on the morning of the day he died it was from newtown and the address was in a woman s writing i forgot all about it but some time after sir charles died my wife was cleaning the fireplace in his study she found a letter most of it was burned but the bottom of one page was not burned on it was written please please burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o clock l l the paper fell into pieces as my wife went to move it we don t know who l l is but if you could find out you might learn more about sir charles death we haven t told anyone else we felt it would not be good for poor kind sir charles but we thought we ought to tell you sir henry the barrymores left us and sir henry turned to me if we can find l l the mystery may be at an end he said what do you think we should do watson i must write to holmes at once i said and i went straight to my room and wrote a letter to holmes which gave him all the details of barrymore s story on the following day heavy rain fell without stopping i put on my coat and went for a long walk on the moor i thought of selden out on the cold moor in this weather and i thought of the other man the mysterious watcher as i walked dr mortimer drove past me he stopped and said he would take me back to the hall i expect you know almost everybody living near here i said do you know a woman whose names begin with the let ters l l dr mortimer thought for a minute and then he said yes mrs laura lyons she lives in newtown who is she i asked she s mr frankland s daughter what old frankland who has the large telescope yes said dr mortimer laura married a painter called lyons who came to paint pictures of the moor but he was cruel to her and after a while he left her her father will not speak to her because she married against his wishes so her husband and her father have made her life very unhappy how does she live i asked several people who knew her sad story have helped her stapleton and sir charles gave her some money i gave a little myself she used the money to start a typewriting business dr mortimer wanted to know why i was asking about mrs lyons however i preferred to keep the reason secret and we talked about other things for the rest of the journey only one other thing of interest happened that day in the evening after dinner i had a few words with barrymore alone i asked him whether selden had left the country i don t know sir barrymore replied i hope he has gone but i ve not heard anything of him since i last left food and some clothes for him and that was three days ago did you see him then no sir but the food and clothes were gone when i next went that way barrymore told me then selden was certainly there i asked i think so sir unless the other man took everything i sat very still and looked hard at barrymore you know there is another man then have you seen him no sir but selden told me about him a week or more ago he is hiding from someone too but he is not an escaped prisoner i don t like it sir something evil is going to happen i m sure sir henry would be much safer in london did selden tell you anything more about the other man i asked he looked like a gentleman he was living in one of the old stone huts on the moor a boy works for him and brings him all the food and things he needs that s all selden told me i thanked him and he left me i went to the window and looked out at the rain and the clouds it was a wild night i knew the huts barrymore had spoken about there were many of them on the moor they had been built many hundreds of years ago by the people who lived on the moor they would not keep a man warm and dry in bad weather selden could not choose to live anywhere else but why did the other man live in such conditions i sat and thought what i should do next i decided i must try to find the man who had been watching us was he the enemy who had been following us since the very beginning in london if he was and i could catch him perhaps our difficulties would be at an end i also decided to hunt the man on my own sir henry was still shaken by the terrible cry we had heard on the moor i did not want to add to his troubles or to lead him into more danger laura lyons told sir henry about laura lyons and that i wanted to speak to her as soon as possible then i went to her house in newtown a maid took me into the sitting room where a very pretty lady with dark hair was working at a typewriter i told her who i was and that i had met her father i have no contact with my father she said he gave me no help when i was in trouble sir charles baskerville and some other kind people helped me when i was poor and hungry it is about sir charles that i have come to see you i said i want to know if you ever wrote to him and asked him to meet you she looked very angry and her face went white what a question she said what right have you to ask me about my private life but the answer is no surely you are not remembering clearly i said i think you wrote to him on the day that he died and your letter said please please burn this letter and be at the gate by ten o clock for a moment i thought she was going to faint then she said in a low oice i asked sir charles to tell nobdy you must not think that sir charles spoke to anyone about you i said he put the letter on the fire but not all of it was burnt now did you write that letter to him yes she said why should i be ashamed of writing to him i wanted him to help me i learned that he was going to london early on the following day so i asked him to meet me before he went i could not go to the hall earlier that day but why did you ask him to meet you in the garden instead of in the house i asked do you think it would be sensible for a woman to go at that time of night into the house of an unmarried man she asked well what happened when you got there i asked i didn t go she replied mrs lyons i tell you i did not go something happened that stopped me from going i can t tell you what it was mrs lyons i said if you did not see sir charles you must tell me why if you do not it will look very bad for you if i have to go to the police with this new piece of information about the letter mrs lyons thought for a moment and then she said i see that i must tell you perhaps you know that i married a man who was very cruel to me i hate him and i wanted to get a di vorce but a divorce is expensive and i had no money i thought that if sir charles heard my sad story he would help me to get a divorce then why didn t you go to see sir charles i asked her because i got help from someone else she said why didn t you write to sir charles and tell him i was going to but i saw in the newspaper the next morning that he had died i asked mrs lyons a number of other questions but she did not change her story whatever i asked her i was sure that she was telling the truth i could check two important parts of the story if they were right there could be no doubt that she was telling the truth i could check that she had begun to get her divorce at about the time of sir charles death i could also check that she had not been to baskerville hall on the night of sir charles death but i was not sure that she had told me the whole truth why had she nearly fainted when i had told her about the letter that was not completely explained by the story she had told me i had discovered all i could for the moment i left her and went to search for more information in a different place the man on the moor i drove out of newtown and went to begin my search for the mysterious man on the moor there were hundreds of the old stone huts on the moor barrymore did not know in which of them the mysterious man was living i had seen the man on the night when sir henry and i had chased selden so i decided to start my search near that place the path i took ran past mr frankland s house and i saw him standing at his gate he called to me and invited me to go in and have a drink with him he had been arguing with the police and was angry with them he began to tell me about it but they will be sorry he said i could tell them where to look for the escaped prisoner but i am not going to help them you see i have been searching the moors with my telescope and although i have not actually seen the prisoner i have seen the person who is taking him food i thought of barrymore and mrs barrymore s worried faces but mr frankland s next words showed me that i did not need to worry you will be surprised to hear that a young boy takes food to the prisoner the boy goes by at about the same time each day and he is always carrying a bag who else can he be going to see except the prisoner come and look through my telescope and you will see that i am right it is about this time each day that the boy goes by we went up onto the roof and we did not have to wait long there was someone moving on a hill in front of the house i looked through the telescope and saw a small boy with a bag over his shoulder he looked around to make sure that noboay was following him and then he disappeared over the hill remember that i don t want the police to know my secret dr watson frankland reminded me i m too angry with them at the moment to help them i agreed not to tell the police and said goodbye i walked along the road while frankland was watching me but as soon as i was round the corner i went towards the hill where we had seen the boy the sun was already going down when i reached the top of the hill i could not see the boy and there was nothing else in that lonely place beneath me on the other side of the hill was a circle of old stone huts in the middle of the circle was one hut that had a better roof than the others so it would keep out the wind and the rain this must be the place where the mysterious man was hiding i would soon know his secret as i walked towards the hut i saw that someone had cer tainly been using it a path had been worn up to the door i took my revolver out of my pocket and checked that it was ready to fire i walked quickly and quietly up to the hut and looked inside the place was empty but this was certainly where the man lived as i looked round the hut i knew that the mysterious man must have a very strong character no other person could live in conditions as bad as these there were some blankets on a flat stone where the man slept there had been a fire in one corner there were some cooking pots and a large bowl half full of water in the middle of the hut was another large flat stone which was used as a table and on it was the bag the boy had been carrying under the bag i saw a piece of paper with writing on it quickly i picked up the paper and read what was written on it it said dr watson has gone to newtown i realized that the mysterious man had told someone to watch me and this was a message from his spy was the man a dangerous enemy or was he a friend who was watching us to make sure we were safe i decided i would not leave the hut until i knew outside the sun was low in the sky everything looked calm and peaceful in the golden evening light but i did not feel peaceful or calm i felt frightened as i waited for the mysterious man then i heard footsteps coming towards the hut as they came closer i moved into the darkest corner of the hut i did not want the man to see me until i had looked closely at him the footsteps stopped and i could hear nothing at all then the man began to move again and the footsteps came closer a shadow fell across the door of the hut it s a lovely evening my dear watson said a voice i knew well i really think you will enjoy it more out here too late for a moment or two i could neither breathe nor move then i felt my fear and unhappiness disappear as i knew that i was no longer alone in my responsibility for sir henry the dangers all around me did not seem so frightening the cool voice could belong to only one man in the world holmes i cried holmes i went outside the hut and there was holmes he was sitting on a stone and his grey eyes were dancing with amusement he was thin and worn but bright and wide awake his skin was brown from the wind and the sun but his chin was smooth and his shirt was white he did not look like a man who had been living in the middle of the moor i have never been so glad to see anyone in my life i said nor so surprised i am surprised too holmes said as he shook me warmly by the hand how did you find me i told him about frankland and how i had seen the boy with the food holmes went into the hut and looked at the food and at the note with it i guess that you have been to see mrs laura lyons he said and when i told him that he was right he went on when we put together everything that each of us has discovered i expect we shall know almost everything about this case but how did you get here i asked him and what have you been doing i thought you had to finish your case in london that is what i wanted you to think he said then you have tricked me and have no confidence in me i said i was upset and angry because he had not told me his plans i am sorry if it seems i have tricked you my dear watson i did not want our enemy to know i was here but i wanted to be near enough to make sure that you and sir henry were safe you are a kind person too kind to leave me alone out here in bad weather our enemy would guess i was here if he saw you coming out with food or with important news you have been a very real help to me your letters with all their valuable information have been brought to me you have done excellent work and without you i would not have all the important details i needed holmes warm words of thanks made me feel much happier and i saw that he was right that s better he said as he saw the shadow lift from my face now tell me about your visit to mrs laura lyons i told holmes everything mrs lyons had said this is all very important holmes said it answers questions i have been unable to answer did you know that mrs lyons and stapleton are very close friends they often meet and they write to each other perhaps i can use this information to turn stapleton s wife against him his wife i asked who and where is she the lady called miss stapleton who pretends to be his sis ter is really his wife said holmes good heavens holmes are you sure if she is his wife why did stapleton allow sir henry to fall in love with her sir henry hurt nobody except himself when he fell in love with her stapleton took care that sir henry did not make love to her i repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister they came here only two years ago and before that he had owned a school in the north of england he told you that and you told me in your letter i checked on the school and found that the man who had owned it went away with his wife when the school closed they changed their name but the couple who were described to me were without doubt the stapletons but why do they pretend to be brother and sister i asked because stapleton thought that she would be very much more useful to him if she appeared to be a free woman suddenly i saw behind stapleton s smiling face a heart with murder in it so he is our enemy he is the man who followed us in london and the warning note to sir henry came form miss stapleton exactly said holmes but if miss stapleton is really his wife why is he a close friend of mrs laura lyons your excellent work has given us the answer to that ques tion watson when you told me that mrs lyons was getting a divorce i realized that she hoped to marry stapleton he told her that he was unmarried and that he wanted to make her his wife when she learns the truth she may decide to help us we must go and see her tomorrow one last question holmes i said what is stapleton trying to do holmes dropped his voice as he answered murder coldblooded murder that is what stapleton is trying to do do not ask me for details i am about to catch him in a trap there is only one danger that he will act before i am ready another day or perhaps two and i shall complete my case until then you must guard sir henry very closely you should be with him today however what you have discovered is very valuable as he finished speaking an awful scream a long cry of pain and horror broke the silence of the moor the sound turned my blood to ice oh my god i whispered what is that holmes had jumped to his feet where is it watson he whispered and i could see that he was shaken by the scream the hopeless cry came again louder nearer and more terrible than before with it came a new sound deep and frightening the hound cried holmes come watson come great heavens if we are too late death on the moor holmes started running over the moor and i followed him from somewhere in front of us came one more hopeless scream it was followed by the sound of something falling heavily we stopped and listened i saw holmes put his hand to his head he has won wat son we re too late i was mad not to act sooner and you watson look what happens when you leave the man i asked you to guard but if the worst has happened we shall see that stapleton doesn t go free we ran through the dark towards the place where the cries had come from we reached a rocky edge from which a steep side fell away below us we saw the body of a man he was ly ing with his face down on the ground he had fallen on his head which was bent under him and his neck was broken holmes lit a match we saw with horror the blood running out onto the ground from his head we both remembered clearly the suit the man was wearing it was a thick red brown country suit it was the suit sir hen ry had been wearing on the morning when we first met him in baker street we saw it for a moment and then the match went out our hearts turned sick and cold inside us the devil the murderer i shall never forgive myself for leaving sir henry alone i whispered angrily it s more my fault than yours said holmes i have let this good man die because i was busy with the last details of my case it is the greatest mistake i have ever made but why did he come out onto the moor i told him it would lead to his death now both sir henry and his uncle have been murdered by heavens clever as he is i shall trap stapleton before another day is past with heavy hearts we stood on either side of the broken body then holmes bent over the body and began to move it all of a sudden he began to laugh and jump up and down look at the face he shouted hitting me on the back it is not sir henry it s selden the escaped prisoner we turned the body over there was no doubt about it i had seen the face before on the night sir henry and i had chased selden over the moor then i suddenly remembered and everything became clear sir henry had told me how he gave his old clothes to barrymore i realized that this suit had been among the clothes barrymore had left for selden and i told holmes then the clothes have caused the death of the poor man the hound had been given something of sir henry s to smell so that it would pick up his scent and follow him i think that is why the shoe was taken from the hotel in london so the hound followed the scent and bunted this man but there is one thing i don t understand how did selden know that the hound was following him we know he ran a long way he was screaming for a long time before he fell and we could hear that he was running as he screamed so the hound was a long way behind him when he began to run how could he see it in the dark how did he know it was there until it was close behind him i cannot answer that i said but there is something else i don t understand why was the hound out on the moor tonight stapleton would not let it go out unless he thought sir henry was there we may know the answer to that question very soon said holmes here comes stapleton his sharp eyes had seen a figure moving in the darkness in front of us and s the man came closer i could see that it was indeed stapleton we must be very careful not to show that we suspect him holmes warned me stapleton stopped when he saw us and then walked forward again dr watson is that you i didn t expect to see you on the moor at this time of night but dear me what s this somebody hurt not don t tell me that it s our friend sir henry he went past me and bent over the dead man i heard him breathe in quickly who who is this he asked his voice shaking it s selden the escaped prisoner stapleton quickly managed to hide the look of surprise and disappointment on his face as he turned towards us he looked sharply from holmes to me dear me how terrible how did he die we think he broke his neck by falling over the edge of these rocks i said i heard a cry and that is why i came out i was worried about sir henry stapleton said why were you worried about sir henry i asked because i had invited him to my house when he did not come i was surprised then when i heard cries on the moor i began to worry about him i wonder his eyes went quickly from my face to holmes did you hear anything else at all no said holmes did you no said stapleton what do you mean then oh you know the stories about the supernatural hound i wondered if it had been here tonight we heard nothing of that kind i said how do you think this poor man fell to his death stapleton asked i think cold and hunger and his fear that the police would catch him drove him mad he ran round the moor in his madness and fell over this edge i said do you agree mr sherlock holmes asked stapleton you re quick to guess who i am said holmes we re been expecting you ever since dr watson arrived i have no doubt my friend is right about the way selden died said holmes it s a sad death but it will not prevent me from returning to london tomorrow before you return will you be able to explain the mysteries that we ve experienced here i am not always as successful as i hope i need facts not stories of the supernatural this hasn t been a good case for me stapleton looked hard at him but holmes had spoken very seriously and his words sounded true we covered the body then stapleton turned to go home and holmes and i walked towards baskerville hall he s a very clever man and a dangerous enemy who will be difficult to trap said holmes look how he controlled his disappointment when he found that the dead man was not sir henry i m sorry that he has seen you i said so am i but there was nothing we could do about it now he knows i am here he may be more careful or he may act more quickly than he planned why can t we give him to the police at once because we can t prove anything against him sir charles was found dead because his heart failed again tonight we could not prove that there was a hound selden died from a fall we have no case at present we shall see mrs lyons tomorrow and she may help us but whatever happens i have my own plan there will be some danger but by the end of to morrow i hope to have won this battle he would say nothing else are you coming to the hall i asked yes he replied there is no reason for me to hide any longer but one last word watson say nothing of the hound to sir henry let him think that selden died from a fall if he knows about the hound he will find it harder to face the dangers of tomorrow i think you told me in your last letter that he is having dinner with the stapletons tomorrow evening and they have invited me too i reminded him then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone that can easily be arranged and now i think we are both ready for some food the trap when we reached the hall sir henry was very pleased to see holmes but he was surprised that holmes had no luggage and that he appeared so unexpectedly i had the unhappy job of telling barrymore and his wife about her brother s death mrs barrymore cried and was very sad indeed during dinner sir henry told us that he had spent a dull day and evening on his own he had kept his promise to holmes and so he had not accepted the stapletons invitation to their house that evening we did not tell him how glad we were that he had stayed away from the moor holmes started to say something and then he stopped sud denly his eyes were fixed on one of the pictures of the past baskervilles on the wall sir henry could you tell me which baskerville that is he asked sir henry and i both looked at the picture that is sir hugo the one who started all the trouble said sir henry he was the first to see the hound holmes looked hard at the picture but said nothing more then after sir henry had gone to his room holmes made me stand in front of the picture is it like anyone you know he asked he stood on a chair and with his hands he covered the hat and hair of the man in the picture good heavens i cried in surprise i was looking at a pic ture of stapleton s face yes said holmes before i could say anything more there s not much doubt about it stapleton is a baskerville he looks like sir hugo and he has the same evil character now i understand why he wants to kill sir henry i am sure we shall find that he will inherit the baskerville lands and so we have one more answer by tomorrow night stapleton will be canght like one of his butterflies and we shall add him to the baker street collection we soon went to bed i was up early in the morning but holmes was up earlier he had already sent one message to the police about selden and another to his boy to stop him taking food to the hut when sir henry joined us holmes told him that we had to leave for london immediately after breakfast sir henry was very unhappy about this but holmes asked him to help us by doing everything holmes ordered him to do sir henry agreed to help in this way and to go by himself to the stapletons that evening he also agreed to tell the stapletons that holmes and i had gone to london but that we would return to devonshire soon one more order said holmes i want you to drive to the stapletons house and then send the driver away let the sta pletons know that you re going to walk home across the moor across the moor said sir henry very surprised but you have told me again and again not to do that this time it will be completely safe i know that you are brave enough to do it and it must be done then i will do it but you must keep to the path between the stapletons house and the grimpen road which is your natural way home do not leave the path i was very surprised by all this holmes had told stapleton that he would return to london but he had not said that i was going too and i was very worried that neither of us would be with sir henry when he walked across the moor that night but we had to obey holmes orders holmes and i left baskerville hall immediately after breakfast and went to the station at newtown a small boy was waiting on the platform any orders sir he asked holmes you will take the train to london my boy when you get there you will send a telegram to sir henry in my name it will ask him to send to me at baker street the pocket book i left at the hall i began to understand some of holmes plan when sir henry received the telegram sent by holmes boy he would think that we had arrived in london he would tell stapleton who would then also believe that we were far away from baskerville hall in fact we would be very close in case sir henry needed us we left the station and went to see mrs laura lyons i introduced holmes to her after they had shaken hands he said dr watson has told me everything mrs lyons we see sir charles death as a case of murder both stapleton and his wife are suspects mrs lyons jumped from her chair his wife she cried he has no wife he is not a married man i have come here ready to prove that he is married and the woman calls herself his sister is really his wife said holmes he took some photographs and papers from his pocket and showed them to mrs lyons she looked at the photographs and read the papers when she put them down i could see that she had accepted the truth i thought this man loved me she said but he has lied to me ask me what you like mr holmes and i will tell you the truth i never thought any harm would come to sir charles he was a dear old gentleman who was very kind to me i would do nothing to hurt him i believe you mrs lyons said holmes now let me tell you what i think happened you can tell me if i m right or if i m wrong first of all i think stapleton told you to write the letter to sir charles and to ask him for help he also told you to ask sir charles to meet you at the moor gate then after you had sent the letter stapleton persuaded you not to meet sir charles after all stapleton told me that he could not allow any other man to give me the money for my divorce mrs lyons said he said he was poor but he would give all his money to bring us together then after i heard about sir charles death stapleton told me to say nothing about my letter and the meeting he said i would be a suspect he frightened me into staying silent yes said holmes but you wondered about him she said nothing for a moment and looked down yes she said but since he has lied to me about marrying me i will no longer keep his secrets you are lucky that you have escaped him holmes said you know too much but i hope you are safe now good morning mrs lyons and thank you you will hear from us soon so one by one our questions are answered said holmes as we left newtown when it is over this will be one of the most famous cases of our time and now it has nearly ended we must hope that it ends safely and successfully the hound of the baskervilles that evening holmes and i drove across the moor until we could see the lights of the stapletons house in front of us then we got out and began to walk very quietly along the path towards the house when we were very close holmes told me to stop he took his revolver from his pocket and i did the same we shall hide behind these rocks he whispered watson you know the house so i want you to go forward and look through the windows i want to know where the staple tons and sir henry are and what they are doing take great care because they must not know that somebody is watching them very carefully and quietly i moved towards the house i looked first into the dining room window statleton and sir henry were sitting and smoking their cigars but there was no sign of miss stapleton i moved round to the other windows but i could not see her in any of the rooms i went back to the dining room window and as i looked in again stapleton left the room and came out of the house he went to a hut beside the house and unlocked the door i heard a strange sound coming from the hut but i could not think what was making the noise then stapleton locked the door and went back into the house and into the dining room i went back to holmes and told him what i had seen he wanted to know where miss stapleton was and i had to tell him twice that there was no sign of her in the house the moon was shining on the great grimpen marsh and a fog was rising from it holmes watched the fog and began to look worried the fog was creeping up from the marsh towards the house we were hidden near the path which was on the far side of the house from the marsh the fog is moving towards us watson and that is very serious said holmes it is the one thing that could make my plans go wrong as we watched the fog which had crept as far as the house began to flow round it angrily holmes hit the rock in front of us with his open hand if sir henry doesn t come out in the next quarter of an hour the path will be covered by the fog in half an hour we shall not be able to see our hands in front of our faces we must move back to higher ground above the fog we moved away from the house and out of the fog which was creeping slowly along the ground and hiding the path from our view we must not go too far said holmes if we do sir henry may be caught before he reaches us holmes went down on one knee and put his ear to the ground thank heaven i think i hear him coming then we heard quick footsteps on the path after a few moments sir henry appeared out of the fog and walked on in the clear moonlight he came quickly along the path passed close to where we were hidden and began to walk up the hill behind us as he walked he looked over his shoulder again and again like a man who is worried that something is following him listen said holmes sharply look out it s coming i heard him make his revolver ready to fire and i did the same there was a sound of quick light footsteps from inside the curtain of fog the thick cloud had crept to within fifty metres of where we were hidden we tried to see into it and wondered what horrible thing would appear i looked at holmes his eyes were fixed on the place where the path disappeared into the fog he was pale but his eyes were bright he looked like a man who was going to win the most important game of his life then suddenly his eyes nearly jumped out of his head and his mouth opened in frightened surprise i looked away from him to see what his eyes were fixed on when i saw the awful shape that was coming towards us out of the fog my blood turned cold the revolver nearly fell from my hands and my whole body froze with fear i saw a hound an enormous black hound it was bigger than any dog i had ever seen but it was something else that filled us with terror no human eye had ever seen a hound like this one fire came from its open mouth its eyes were burning flames covered its head and body it was a more horrible sight than anyone could imagine a hell hound sent by the devil it was not a creature of the natural world the huge black burning hound ran quickly and silently after sir henry far away along the path we saw him turn and look back at the hound his face was white in the moonlight and his hands were lifted in horror he watched helplessly as the terrible creature got closer to him we were so frozen bythe ghostly and unnatural sight that we let the hound go past us and we could not move our friend was near to death and we were helpless with fear the search for the murderer then our fear for sir henry became greater than our terror holmes and i fired our revolvers together the creature gave a loud cry of pain and we knew we had hit it but it did not stop and ran on after sir henry when we heard the cry of pain our fears disappeared this was no supernatural hound our bullets could hurt it and we could kill it we ran after it as fast as we could i have never seen anyone run as quickly as holmes ran that night and i could not keep up with him in front of us on the path we heard scream after scream from sir henry and the deep voice of the hound i saw the creature jump at sir henry and throw him to the ground its teeth went for his throat but the next moment holmes had emptied his revolver into the hound s body it gave a last deep cry its teeth closed on the empty air and it fell to the ground i put my revolver to its head but i did not need to fire the hound was dead sir henry lay unconscious where he had fallen quickly we opened the neck of his shirt holmes had fired just in time and the hound s teeth had not reached our friend s throat already his eyes were beginning to open and he looked up at us my god he whispered what was it what in heaven s name was it it s dead whatever it was said holmes we ve killed the family ghost for ever the creature that lay before us was as large as a small lion its mouth and teeth were huge they shone with blue flames there were rings of blue fire round its cruel eyes too i touched the hound s burning coat when i held up my hand it too seemed to be on fire phosphorus i said that is why the hound appears to burn in the dark stapleton put phosphorous paint on the hound in the hut beside the house but holmes was thinking more about sir henry than about stapleton s cleverness i must apologize to you sir henry he said i put your life in danger i expected to see a huge hound but not a creature like this the fog gave us a very short time to control our fear and for moments we could not move never mind said sir henry you saved my life and i thank you please help me stand up what are you going to do now sir henry s legs were shaking so much from his terrible experience that he could not stand we helped him to a rock he sat there and held his head in his hands we must leave you here sir henry and try to catch stapleton we shall come back as quickly as possible and take you to the hall our case is complete but we must now catch our man i followed holmes along the path back to the house we must search the house said holmes but almost certainly he won t be there he probably heard the noise of our guns so he knows his evil game is finished the front door of the house was open we went in and looked from room to room all the rooms downstairs were empty so we went upstairs and looked in all the rooms except one which was locked there s someone in there i said i heard someone move help me break open this door we threw ourselves against the door and as the lock broke we went in we held our revolvers ready to fire in the middle of the room was a figure tied to a post we could not see whether it was a man or a woman as it was completely covered with sheets only the eyes and nose were free we pulled off the sheets and untied the prisoner from the post it was miss stapleton as we untied her we could see long red bruises across her neck that cruel devil stapleton has beaten her holmes said put her into a chair miss stapleton had fainted from the beating and exhaustion as we put her into the chair she opened her eyes is he safe she asked has he escaped he cannot escape us miss stapleton holmes said no no i don t mean my husband i mean sir henry is he safe yes i said and the hound is dead thank god she said thank god oh the cruel devil look what he has done to me she showed us her arms and we saw with horror that her skin was black and blue where she had been beaten but he has hurt me more in other ways while i thought he loved me i accepted many things but he doesn t love me he has used me then help us now said holmes tell us where he has gone there is an old house on an island in the middle of the marsh she said he kept his hound there he also had the house ready in case he needed to escape he will be there i m sure nobody could find his way into the grimpen marsh in this fog tonight said holmes looking out of the window the fog lay like white wool against the glass and we knew we could not try to follow him until it cleared we decided to take sir henry back to baskerville hall we had to tell him everything about the stapletons and he was deeply hurt when he heard the truth about the woman he loved the news that she was married and the awful fear he had experienced brought on a fever we sent for dr mortimer who came and sat with sir henry throughout the night on the following morning miss stapleton took us to the path through the marsh the fog had lifted and she showed us the sticks which she and her husband had put in to mark the way we followed them through the marsh which smelled of dying plants the wet ground pulled at our feet as we walked from time to time one of us stepped from the path and sank up to his waist in the marsh one man on his own could not hope to escape the pull of the marsh without help he would sink to his death but we did not find any sign of stapleton we searched andsearched without success there is no doubt that he lost hisway in the fog and sank in the marsh somewhere deep down his body lies to this day we reached the island miss stapleton had described and searched the old house this place tells us nothing that we do not already know said holmes these bones show that he hid the hound here but he could not keep it quiet so people heard its cries here is the bottle of phosphorous paint stapleton used it very cleverly on the hound after what we saw and felt last night we cannot be surprised that sir charles died of fright and now i understand how selden knew that the hound was following him in the dark it s not surprising the poor man screamed and ran as he did the old story of the supernatural hound probably gave stapleton the idea of using phosphorus very clever i said it in london and i say it again watson we have never had a more dangerous enemy than the one who is lying out there and he pointed to the great marsh that was all round us looking back it was the end of november more than a month after ourreturn from baskerville hall holmes and i were sitting on either side of a bright fire in our sitting room in baker street since our return holmes had been working hard on two other cases and he had been too busy to discuss the baskerville case but now the other cases were finished and he had been successful in both of them i decided it was a good time to ask him the final questions about stapleton and the hound the picture showed us that stapleton was indeed a baskerville holmes began he was the son of roger baskerville who was sir charles younger brotner roger was a criminal who escaped from prison and ran away to south america everyone thought he had died unmarried but that was not true he had one son also called roger whom we knew as stapleton stapleton married a beautiful south american and came to england where he started a school in the north he discovered that he would inherit the baskerville lands and fortune if sir charles and sir henry both died that is why he moved to devonshire when the school closed when he met sir charles he heard the story of the hellhound he also learned that sir charles believed these supernatural stories and that he had a weak heart stapleton had the idea of buying a huge hound and of using the phosphorus to make it shine like the hound in the story i have found the place where he bought the animal he took it by train to devonshire and walked many miles over the moors with it so that it would not be seen near baskerville hall he needed to get sir charles out of the hall at night this would be easy to do if his wife made sir charles fall in love with her but although he beat her she refused to help him with his evil plan then stapleton met laura lyons we know that he made her write a letter to bring sir charles to the moor gate on that sad night the hound which was shining with phosphorus chased sir charles down the yew alley sir charles terror was so great that his weak heart stopped and he died but the animal did not touch the dead body the hound had run on the grass so it left no footprints except the one found by dr mortimer you see how clever stapleton was neither he nor the hound had touched sir charles so there was no sign of murder the only two people who might suspect him his wife and mrs lyons could not be certain about what he had done anyway neither of them would inform the police about him next stapleton learned that sir henry had reached england so he went to london he hoped to murder sir henry there he took his wife with him but he wasn t sure that she would keep his secret so he did not tell her the truth he locked her up in their hotel she knew that he had some evil plan but she was too frightened to give sir henry a clear warning instead she sent him the letter made of words cut from a newspaper meanwhile stapleton was wearing a false beard and following sir henry he needed something to give the hound sir henry s scent so he paid a maid at sir henry s hotel to steal one of his shoes the first one was a new one and didn t have sir henry s scent on it it was no use for the hound so he put it back and another older shoe was stolen when the shoes were changed i knew that the hound must be a natural and not a supernatural creature next there was the letter made of words cut from a newspaper when i looked at it i held it close to my eyes i noticed a smell of perfume so i guessed that a woman had sent the letter by the time i went to devonshire i knew that there was a real hound and i knew we were looking for a man and a woman i guessed that the stapletons were the pair i had to watch stapleton but i had to hide myself as i have explained i could not tell you what i was doing i stayed in newtown and used the hut on the moor only when necessary your letters were sent to me immediately from baker street and were very helpful when you told me that stapleton had owned a school in the north of england i checked on him and where he had come from i discovered he had come from south america and then everything became clear by the time you found me on the moor i knew everything but i could prove nothing we had to catch the man doing something criminal and so i had to put sir henry in danger dr mortimer tells me that sir henry will be completely better after some rest as you know the two of them have become good friends and are going on a long holiday together sir henry will take some time to forget miss stapleton he loved her deeply and it hurt him badly when he learned the truth about her she was very frightened of her cruel husband but she suspected that he was responsible for sir charles death she knew about the hound and when selden died she guessed that the hound had killed him she knew her husband had the hound at their house on the night sir henry came to dinner they argued about the hound that evening and as they argued stapleton told her about mrs lyons any love she had for her husband disappeared at that moment he knew that she wanted to help sir henry so he beat her and tied her up he probably hoped that when he inherited the baskerville lands she would love him again he certainly thought that she would keep silent if she became lady baskerville but i think he was wrong he had been too cruel to her she could not forgive him or love him again nor i think allow him to enjoy the results of his crime of course he could not frighten sir henry in the same way as sir charles sir henry was a young and healthy man so he kept the hound hungry he knew that the animal would either kill sir henry or would hurt him so badly that it would be easy to complete the murder i had one last question for holmes but stapleton was living so close to baskerville hall and using a false name it looked very strange how would he explain that to the police if after sir henry s death he then inherited the baskerville lands and fortune i don t know how he planned to explain the false name and why he was living at pen house said holmes i can only say that he was a very clever man i am sure he had thought of an answer to the problem but that s enough work for the evening watson i have two tickets for the theatre if we get ready now we shall have time to stop at my favourite restaurant for some dinner on the way txtba www txtba com a voyage to lilliput i was born in nottinghamshire and was the third of five sons my father was not a rich man but he was able to send me to cambridge university where i studied for three years when i left college i continued my studies and became a doctor but i always wanted to travel and so i made several voyages as a ship s doctor when i married my wife mary however i planned to stay at home for a while but after a few years i discovered i was not earning enough money from my patients i decided to go to sea again and this time i joined a ship sailing to the islands in the south pacific ocean we started our journey from bristol on may th at first our voyage went well we sailed across the atlantic round the coast of africa and into the indian ocean but before we could reach the pacific a violent storm hit us and drove us to the north west of tasmania the wind drove our ship on to a rock which broke the ship in half some of the sailors and i managed to get a boat into the water and we rowed away to look for land but when we were too tired to row any more a great wave hit our small boat and we all fell into the sea i do not know what happened to my companions but i suppose they were all drowned the wind and waves pushed me along as i struggled to keep my head above water i became very tired and soon felt i could not swim any more luckily just then my feet touched the ground i walked out of the sea and on to a beach where there was no sign of any people or houses i was so exhausted that i lay down and went to sleep when i woke up next morning and tried to get up i could not move i was lying on my back and my whole body my arms and legs were strongly fastened to the ground even my hair which was long and thick was tied to the ground the sun began to grow hot and i was very uncomfortable soon i felt something alive moving along my leg and up my body to my face and when i looked down i saw a very small human being only fifteen centimetres tall he had a bow and arrow in his hands and there were forty more of these little men fol lowing him i was so surprised that i gave a great shout they all jumped back very frightened and some hurt themselves by falling off my body meanwhile i was struggling to unfas ten myself but just as i managed to pull my left arm free of the ropes i felt a hundred arrows land on my free hand and more arrows on my face and body this was very painful and made me cry aloud i lay quietly to see what would happen next when they saw i was no longer struggling they quickly built a platform next to my head and an official climbed up there to speak to me although i could not understand his lan guage i understood that they would be friendly towards me if i did not try to harm them by now i was extremely hungry so i used sign language to beg the official for food he seemed to understand me because immediately ladders were put against my sides and little men climbed up with baskets of food and drink they were surprised at how much i could eat and drink in just one mouthful i ate three of their meat dishes and three of their loaves of bread i drank two of their barrels of wine and was still thirsty because that was only half a litre while they were bringing me food i wondered whether to pick up a handful of the little men and throw them to their death but i was afraid they would shoot at me again and anyway i was grateful for their kindness in giving me food and drink so i did not move after some time another official climbed up to the platform and spoke to me from his signs i understood that they were going to move me the king of this country which was called lilliput had ordered his people to carry me to the capital city about a kilometre away i made signs to ask whether i could be untied but the official politely refused while i was eating a platform had been prepared to carry me the people of lilliput known as the lilliputians are very intelligent and clever with their hands for me five hun dred men built a special wooden platform with twenty two wheels nine hundred of the strongest men worked for about three hours to lift me on to the platform and one thousand five hundred of the king s largest horses each eleven and a half centimetres high pulled me to the capital i did not know about any of this because they had put a sleeping powder in my wine and i was in a deep sleep the king had decided i would stay in the largest available building just outside the city gates its door was only a metre high and half a metre wide so i could only just get inside on my hands and knees my guards put ninety one chains on my left leg so that i could not escape then they cut the ropes that tied me and i was able to get to my feet as i stood up i heard cries of astonishment all around me i felt rather miser able but at least i could walk about now in a two metre cir cle i was certainly an interesting sight for the lilliputians who had come out of the city in crowds of several thousand to see me now i had a good view of the countryside the fields looked like flowerbeds in a garden and even the tallest trees were on ly two metres high i was soon visited by the king himself he has a strong handsome face and is very popular among his people he ar rived with his queen his children and his lords and ladies all dressed in beautiful gold and silver clothes in order to make conversation easier i lay on my side so that my face was close to him i spoke to him in all the languages i knew but we still could not understand each other the king ordered his people to make me a bed using six hundred lilliputian beds it was not very comfortable but it was better than sleeping on the stone floor he ordered the crowds of sightseers to go back to their homes so that the work of the country could continue and i would not be annoyed for a long time he discussed with his lords in private what should be done with me i was told all this later by a good friend of mine clearly such a large person could be a danger to his small people at last it was decided that as i had behaved so well up to now i would be kept alive food and drink would be brought to me every day from all the vil lages six hundred people would be my servants three hun dred men would make me a new suit and six teachers would teach me their language and so in about three weeks i began to speak the language of lilliput the king often visited me and every time he came i asked him to take off my chains he explained that first i must promise not to fight against lilliput or hurt lil liputians and that i must be searched for weapons i agreed to both these things and carefully picked up two of his officers in my hands i put them first in one pocket then moved them to all my other pockets except two which i kept secret as they searched they wrote down in a notebook details of all the things they found afterwards i read some of their report in the second coat pocket we found two very large pieces of wood and inside them were great pieces of metal very sharp in another pocket there was a most wonderful engine at the end of a long chain the engine was inside a huge round con tainer which was made half of silver and half of another metal this second metal was very strange as we could see through it to some mysterious writing and pictures the en gine made a continuous loud noise the officers could not guess what these things were but they were of course my two pocket knives and my watch they also found my comb a purse with several gold and silver coins my gun and bullets the king wanted to know what the gun was used for bring it out he ordered me and show me how it works i took the gun out and put a bullet into it den t be afraid i warned the king then i fired the gun into the air it was the loudest noise the lilliputians had ever heard hundreds of them thought they were dead and fell down the king himself was very frightened as i gave my gun to the officials to keep i warned them to be careful with it they allowed me to keep all my other things and i hoped that one day soon i would be free life in lilliput i was careful to behave as well as possible to persuade the king to give me my freedom lilliputians soon began to lose their fear of me they called me the man mountain sometimes i lay down and let them dance on my hand and from time to time children came to play games in my hair by now i was able to speak their language well one day the king invited me to watch the regular entertain ments which are greatly enjoyed by him his family and his lords and ladies i was most interested in the rope dancing a very thin rope is fixed thirty centimetres above the ground people who want to become the king s most important officials jump and dance on this rope and whoever jumps highest with out falling gets the best job sometimes the king orders his lords to dance on the rope to show that they can still do it this sport is of course rather dangerous and there are occa sional deaths as a result it seems a strange way of choosing of ficials there was another interesting entertainment the king holds a stick in front of him and sometimes moves it up and down one by one people come up to him and jump over the stick or crawl under it they go on jumping and crawling as the king moves the stick the winner is the one who jumps and crawls for the longest time and he receives a blue ribbon to wear round his waist the second best receives a red ribbon and the third best gets a green one many of the lil liput lords wear their ribbons proudly at all times i had cer tainly never seen entertainment like this in any of the countries i had visited before some days later a strange black thing was seen on the beach where i had first arrived in lilliput when the people realized it was not alive they decided that it must belong to the manmountain and the king ordered them to bring it to me i thought i knew what it was when it arrived it was rather dirty because it had been pulled along the ground by horses but i was delighted to see that it was in fact my hat i had lost it in the sea when swimming away from the ship i begged the king so often for my freedom that at last he and his lords agreed that i need not be a prisoner any longer however i had to promise certain things to help the lilliputians in war and peace to give two hours warning before a visit to their capital so that people could stay indoors to be careful not to step on any lilliputians or their animals to carry important messages for the king if necessary to help the king s workmen carry heavy stones to stay in lilliput until the king allowed me to leave on his side the king promised i would receive food and drink enough for lilliputians i agreed to everything at once my chains were broken and i was free at last the first thing i did was visit the capital city the people were warned so that they would not be in danger i stepped carefully over the city wall which was less than a metre high and walked slowly through the two main streets it is usually a very busy city with shops and markets full of people but to day the streets were empty there were crowds watching me from every window in the middle of the city is the king s palace the king had invited me to enter it so i stepped over the surrounding wall into the palace garden but unfortunately the palace itself has walls a metre and a half high around it i did not want to damage these walls by trying to climb over them so i walked carefully back out of the city and into the king s park here i cut down several of the largest trees with my knife and made two wooden boxes when i returned to the palace with my boxes i was able to stand on one box on one side of the wall and step on to the other box on the other side i lay down on the ground and looked through the win dows right into the king s rooms you cannot imagine a more beautiful place to live in the rooms and furniture are perfect in every detail as i was looking in i could see the queen surrounded by her lords and ladies she kindly put her hand ont of the window for me to kiss i think i should give you some general information about lilliput most lilliputians are about fifteen centimetres tall the birds and animals are of course much smaller than the people and the tallest trees are only a little taller than i am all crimes here are punished but if someone is accused of a crime and then it is proved that the accuser is lying the accus er is immediately killed lilliputians believe that there are two sides to the law criminals must be punished but people of good character must be rewarded so if a man can prove that he has obeyed every law for six years he receives a present of money from the king they also believe that any man who is honest truthful and good can serve his king and country it is more important to have a good character than to be clever or intelligent however only those who believe in god are allowed to be the king s officials many of their laws and customs are very different from ours but human nature is the same in every country the lil liputians like us have learnt bad ways choosing officials because they are able to dance on a rope is just one example now i shall return to my adventures in lilliput about two weeks after my first visit to the capital i was visited by one of the king s most important officials his name was reldresal and he had helped me many times since i had arrived in lil liput i started the conversation i m so glad they ve taken away my chains i told him well my friend he answered let me tell you some thing you re only free because the king knows we re in a very dangerous situation dangerous i cried what do you mean lilliput has enemies at home and abroad he explained for six years now we ve had two political groups the high heels and the low heels perhaps the high heels were more popular in the past but as you can see our present king and all bis officials wear the lowest heels the two groups hate each other and a high heel will refuse to speak to a low heel that s the problem in lilliput now we re getting in formation that the people of blefuscu are going to attack us have you heard of blefuscu it s an island very near us almost as large and important as lilliput they ve been at war with us for three years you see but how did this war start i asked well you know of course that most people used to break their boiled eggs at the larger end but our king s grandfather once cut a finger while breaking his egg this way and so his father the king ordered all lilliputians from then on to break the smaller end of their eggs people who do that are called small endians but lilliputians feel strongly about this and some big endians have fought angrily against this law as many as eleven thousand people have been killed because they refused to break their eggs at the smaller end some of the big endians have escaped to join our enemies in blefuscu the king of blefuscu has always wanted to defeat lilliput in war and now we hear that he s prepared a large number of ships which will attack us very soon so you see my friend how much our king needs your help in order to defeat his enemies i did not hesitate for a moment please tell the king i answered warmly that l am ready to give my life to save him or his country lilliput at war the island of blefuscu is only about a kilometre to the north of lilliput i knew that just beyond the narrow sea separating the two countries there were at least fifty war ships ready to attack us with many other smaller ships but i kept away from that side of the coast so that the people of blefuscu would not see me i had a secret plan from the king s workmen i ordered fifty heavy metal hooks each fastened to a piece of strong rope i took off my coat and shoes and walked into the sea with the hooks and ropes in my hands the water was deep in the middle so i had to swim for a few metres but it only took me half an hour to get to blefuscu when the blefuscans saw me they were so frightened that they jumped out of their ships and swam to the beach i then used one hook for each ship and tied all the ropes together at one end while i was doing this the enemy shot thousands of arrows at me which caused me a lot of pain i was afraid of getting an arrow in my eyes but i suddenly remembered i still had an old pair of reading glasses in my pocket so i put them on and continued my work when i was ready i started walking into the shallow water away from blefuscu as i walked through the waves i pulled the enemy s warships be hind me when the people of blefuscu realized that all their warships were disappearing their cries were terrible to hear as i came nearer to lilliput i saw the king and all his lords and ladies standing on the beach they could only see blefuscu s warships coming closer as i was swimming and my head was occasionally under the water therefore they sup posed that i had drowned and that the blefuscan ships were attacking but when they saw me walking out of the sea they welcomed me warmly with cries of astonishment and delight the king himself came down to the water to meet me everyone in lilliput is grateful to you he cried for your bravery you will be one of my lords from now on thank you sir i replied and now he continued go back and steal all the ene my s ships so that we can defeat blefuscu for ever we ll de stroy the big endians and i ll become king of the whole world but i would not agree to this plan sir i replied i will never help to take a brave nation s freedom away lilliput and blefuscu should live in peace now the king could not persuade me and unfortunately he nev er forgot that i had refused to do what he wanted although i had saved his country from attack by blefuscan warships he preferred to remember my refusal from this time on i heard from my friends that there were secret conversations in the palace between the king and some of his lords who were jealous of me these conversations nearly led to my death in the end about three weeks later the king of blefuscu sent his offi cials to ask for peace between the two countries after the ble fuscans had arranged everything with the lilliputian officials they came to visit me they had heard how i had prevented the king from destroying all their ships after thanking me they invited me to visit their country however when i asked the king of lilliput if i could visit blefuscu he agreed but very coldly i learnt later that he and some of his lords considered i was wrong to have a conversa tion with enemies of lilliput now i was beginning to under stand how difficult and dangerous political life can be a few days later i had another chance to help the king i was woken at midnight by the cries of hundreds of lilliputians outside my house fire fire they shouted the queen s rooms in the palace are burning come quickly man mountain so i pulled on my clothes and hurried to the palace a large part of the building was in flames people were climbing lad ders up the walls and throwing water on the flames but the fire was burning more strongly every minute at least the queen and her ladies had escaped but there seemed to be no way of saving this beautiful palace suddenly i had an idea the evening before i had drunk a lot of good wine and very luckily i had not made water since then in three minutes i managed to put out the whole fire and the lovely old building was safe i went home without waiting for the king s thanks because i was not sure what he would say although i had certainly saved the palace i knew it was a crime punishable by death to make water anywhere near the palace i heard later that the queen was so angry that she refused to enter any of the dam aged rooms ever again and promised to take her revenge on me gulliver escapes from lilliput i soon discovered that flimnap one of the king s highest officials was my secret enemy he had always disliked me although he pretended to like me but now he began to suspect his wife of visiting me privately and he became jealous of course his wife did visit me but always with her daughters and other ladies who came for regular afternoon vis its when visitors arrived at my house i used to bring the coaches and horses inside and put them carefully on my table there was a high edge round the table so that nobody would fall off i sat in my chair with my face close to the table and while i was talking to one group of visitors the others used to drive round the table i spent many hours like this in very enjoyable conversation in the end flimnap realized that his wife was not in love with me and had not done anything wrong but he was still angry with me there were other lords who also disliked me and together they managed to persuade the king that i was a danger to lilliput i knew they were discussing me in private but i was seriously alarmed when i discovered what they had decided luckily as well as reldresal i had another good friend among the king s officials late one night he visited me secretly in order to warn me you know he began that you ve had enemies here for some time many of the lords are jealous of your great success against blefuscu and flimnap still hates you they accuse you of crimes against lilliput crimes punishable by death but i cried that s not right i only want to help lilliput listen he said i must tell you what i ve heard al though my life is in danger if i do they ve accused you of making water in the king s palace refusing to take all the en emy s ships refusing to destroy all the big endians seeing the enemy s officials privately and planning to visit blefuscu in order to help the enemy against lilliput this is unbelievable i cried i must say continued my friend that our king remind ed his lords how much you had helped the country but your enemies wanted to destroy you and they suggested setting fire to your house at night then you would die in the fire what i shouted angrily be quiet nobody must hear us anyway the king decided not to kill you and that s when your friend reldresal started speaking he agreed you d made mistakes but said that a good king should always be generous as our king is and he suggested that a suitable punishment would be for you to lose your sight you d still be strong enough to work for us but you wouldn t be able to help the big endians i covered my eyes with my hands i had wanted to help these people and their king how could they decide to punish me as cruelly as this your enemies were most disappointed with reldresal s plan my friend went on they said you were a big endi an in your heart and reminded the king how much you cost lilliput in food and drink reldresal spoke again to suggest saving money by giving you a little less food every day in this way you d become ill and in a few months you d die and so they all agreed in three days reldresal will be sent to explain your punishment to you he ll inform you that the king has been very kind to you and that you re lucky to lose only your eyes you ll be tied dowu and very sharp arrows will be shot into your eyes the king s doctors will make sure that you can no longer see this is terrible news i said but thank you for warning me my dear friend you alone must decide what to do he replied and now i must leave you so that nobody suspects me of warning you when i was alone i thought about the situation for a long time perhaps i was wrong but i could not see that the king was being kind and generous in ordering such an inhuman pun ishment what should i do i could ask for a trial but i was not confident of the judges honesty i could attack the capital and kill all the lilliputians but when i remembered the king s past kindness to me i did not want to do that at last i decided to escape and so before reldresal came to tell me of my punishment i went to the north of lilliput where our ships lay i took my clothes off and put them into one of the largest warships i also put a blanket into it then i stepped into the sea and swam to blefuscu by pulling the lilliput warship behind me i kept my clothes and blanket dry when i arrived the king of blefuscu sent two guides to show me the way to the capital there i met the king the queen and the lords and ladies in their coaches i explained that i had come to visit blefuscu as i had been invited how ever i did not say anything about the punishment waiting for me in lilliput they welcomed me warmly that night as there was no building big enough for me i slept on the ground covered by my blanket it was not as comfortable as my bed in lilliput but i did not mind i did not spend long in blefuscu only three days after my arrival i noticed a boat in the sea near the beach it was a real boat large enough for me perhaps it had been driven there by a storm i swam out to it and tied ropes to it then with the help of twenty of blefuscu s ships and three thousand sailors i pulled it on to the beach it was not badly damaged and it was exciting to be able to start planning my journey back to england and my home during this time the king of lilliput had written to ask the king of blefuscu to send me back as a prisoner so that i could receive my punishment the king of blefuscu however replied that i was too strong to be taken prisoner and that i would soon be returning to my country anyway secretly he invited me to stay and help him in blefuscu but i no longer believed in the promises of kings or their officials so i politely refused i was now impatient to start my voyage home and the king ordered his workmen to repair the boat and prepare everything i needed i had the meat of one hundred cattle and three hun dred sheep to eat on the journey and i also had some live ani mals to show to my friends in england about one month later i left blefuscu on september th the king the queen and their lords and ladies all came down to the beach to wave goodbye after sailing all day i reached a small island where i slept that night on the third day september th i saw a sail and was delighted to discover that it was an english ship on its way home to england the captain picked me up and i told him my story at first he thought i was mad but when i took the live animals out of my pocket to show him he be lieved me we arrived home at last on april th and i saw my dear wife and children again at first i was delighted to be at home again i earned quite a lot of money by showing my lil liputian animals to people and in the end i sold them for a high price but as the days passed i became restless and wanted to see more of the world and so only two months later i said goodbye to my family and sailed away again a voyage to brobdingnag i left bristol on june th in a ship which was sailing to india we had good sailing weather until we reached the cape of good hope in south africa where we landed to get fresh water we had to stay there for the winter however because the ship needed repairs and the captain was ill in the spring we left africa and sailed round the island of madagascar into the indian ocean but on th april the wind began to blow very violently from the west and we were driv en to the east of the molucca islands on nd may the wind stopped blowing and the sea was calm but our captain who knew that part of the world very well warned us that there would be a storm the next day so we prepared the ship as well as we could and waited the captain was right on rd may the wind began to get stronger it was a wild dangerous wind blowing from the south this time we had to take down our sails as the storm hit our ship huge waves crashed down on to us and the wind drove our helpless ship eastwards into the pacific ocean for several days we struggled with the wind and waves but at last the storm died away and the sea was calm again luckily our ship was not badly damaged but we had been driven over two thousand kilometres to the east none of us knew exactly where we were so the captain decided to contin ue sailing eastwards where we had never been before we sailed on for another two weeks finally on th june we saw a large island with a small piece of land joined to it i later discovered that this country was called brobdingnag the captain sent some of his sailors in a boat to land there and bring back some fresh water i went with them because i was interested in seeing a new country we were delighted to be on land again and while the men looked for a river or a lake i walked for about a kilometre away from the beach when i returned to my astonishment i saw that the sailors were already in the boat they were rowing as fast as they could towards the ship i was going to shout to tell them they had forgotten me when suddenly i saw a huge creature walk ing after them into the sea i realizea he could not catch them because they had nearly got to the ship but i did not wait to see the end of that adventure i ran away from him as fast as possible and did not stop until i found myself in some fields the grass was about seven metres high and the corn about thirteen metres high it took me an hour to cross just one field which had a hedge at least forty metres high the trees were much taller than that just as i was trying to find a hole in the hedge so that i could get into the next field i saw an other giant coming towards me he seemed as tall as a moun tain and every one of his steps measured about ten metres in fear and astonishment i hid in the corn and hoped he would not notice me he shouted in a voice like thunder and seven other giants appeared they seemed to be his servants when he gave the order they began to cut the corn in the field where i was hiding as they moved towards me i moved away but at last i came to a part of the field where rain had knocked down the corn there was no longer anywhere for me to hide and i knew i would be cut to pieces by the giants sharp knives i lay down and prepared to die i could not stop myself thinking of lilliput there i myself had been a giant an important person who had become famous for helping the people of that small country here it was the opposite i was like a lilliputian in europe and i began to understand how a very small creature feels suddenly i noticed that one of the giants was very close to me as his huge foot rose over my head i screamed as loudly as i could he looked around on the ground and finally saw me he stared at me for a moment then very carefully he picked me up with finger and thumb and looked at me i was now twenty metres up in the air and i desperately hoped he would not decide to throw me to the ground i did not struggle and spoke politely to him although i knew he did not understand any of my languages he took me to the farmer who soon realized that i was not an animal but an in telligent being he carefully put me in his pocket and took me home to show to his wife when she saw me she screamed and jumped back in fear perhaps thinking i was an insect but in a little while she became used to me and was very kind to me gulliver and his master soon after we arrived the whole family sat down at the table for dinner there was a large piece of meat on a plate about eight metres across the farmer put me on the table with some small pieces of bread and meat in front of me i was very frightened of falling off the edge of the table which was ten metres from the ground the farmer and his family were delighted to watch me eating food with my own small knife and fork but when i started walking across the table to the farmer his youngest son a boy of about ten picked me up by the legs he held me so high in the air that my whole body trembled fortunately his father took me away at once and angrily hit the boy hard on the head but i re membered how cruel children can he to small animals and i did not want the boy to take his revenge on me so i fell on my knees and asked them not to punish the child any more they seemed to understand just then i heard a noise behind me it sounded like twelve machines running at the same time i turned my head and saw a huge cat three times larger than one of our cows the farmer s wife held it in her arms so that it could not jump at me but in fact because i showed no fear there was no dan ger and the cat even seeemed a little afraid of me at the end of dinner a servant came in with the farmer s one year old son in her arms he immediately started crying and screaming because he wanted to play with me his moth er smiled and put me in his hand when he picked me up and put my head in his mouth i shouted so loudly that he dropped me luckily i was not hurt but it showed me how danger ous life was going to be in brobdingnag after eating the farmer or my master as i shall now call him went back to his work in the fields i think he told his wife to take good care of me because she put me carefully on her bed and locked the bedroom door i was exhausted and slept for two hours when i woke up i felt very small and lonely in such a huge room and on such a large bed suddenly i saw two huge rats run towards me across the bed one came right up to my face so i pulled out my sword and cut open his stomach the other ran away at once i walked up and down on the bed to con trol my trembling legs and looked at the dead rat it was as large as a big dog and its tail measured two metres when my master s wife came into the room some time later i showed her how i had killed the rat she was delighted that i was not hurt and threw the dead rat out of the window my master had a daughter who was about nine years old she was given the special responsibility of taking care of me and i owe her my life during my stay in her country we were always together and she saved me from many dangerous situa tions i called her glumdalclitch which means little nurse she was good at sewing and managed to make some clothes for me in the thinnest material available she also made me a small bed which was placed on a shelf too high for rats to reach perhaps the most useful thing she did was to teach me the language so that in a few days i could speak it quite well soon all my master s neighbours were talking about the strange little creature he had found in a field one of them came to see me and as i walked towards him across the table he put on his glasses his eyes behind the glasses looked like the full moon shining into two windows i thought this was very funny and laughed loudly unfortunately that made him very angry i heard him whispering to my master all evening and i was sorry i had laughed at him next day glumdalclitch came to me in tears you ll never guess what s happened she told me sadly our neighbour has advised father to show you to people for money father s going to take you to market tomorrow where there ll be crowds of people ready to pay for entertain ment i m so ashamed and perhaps you ll get hurt other people won t be as careful with you as i am don t worry glumdalclitch i replied as i m a stranger here i don t mind being shown to people like a strange wild animal i must do what your father wants i was secretly hoping i would one day find a way of escaping and returning to my own country so the next day my master and his daughter got on their huge horse glumdalclitch carried me inside a small box which had air holes so that i could breathe when we arrived at the market town my master hired the largest room in the public house and placed me upon the table there his daugh ter stayed close to me to make sure that nobody hurt me i was told to speak in their language pull out my sword drink from a cup and do other things to amuse the crowd only thirty people were allowed in to see me at one time on that first day everybody wanted to see me and i was shown to over three hundred and fifty people my master s plan was so successful that he arranged to show me again on the next market day i did not look forward to this at all i was so tired with the journey and the entertainment that i could only walk an speak with difficulty for the next three days even when we were at home neighbours and friends from all parts of the country came to look at me and my master made me work hard to amuse them so i had almost no rest my master finally realized that he could make a fortune by showing me to people all over the country so about two months after my arrival in brobdingnag we left the farm and started our journey to the capital as before glumdalclitch came with us to take care of me on the way we stopped in many towns and villages so that i could be shown to people at last after a journey of nearly five thousand kilometres we arrived at the capital now i had to work even harder as peo ple came to look at me ten times a day at the king s palace although glumdalclitch tried to make things as comfortable as possible for me such an exhausting life was be ginning to have a bad effect on my health i was becoming thinner and thinner when my master noticed this he thought i would not live much longer but it was clear that he wanted to make as much money out of me as he could while he was thinking how to do this he was asked to bring me to the palace the queen and her ladies had heard about me and wanted to see me when we arrived in front of the queen i fell on my knees and begged to be allowed to kiss her foot but she kindly held out her hand to me i took her little finger in both my arms and put it very politely to my lips she seemed very pleased with me and finally she said would you enjoy living here in the palace do you think great queen i answered i must do what my master wants but if i were free i would want to spend my whole life obeying your orders she immediately arranged to buy me from my master he was delighted to receive a good price for me especially as he felt sure i would not live longer than a month i also begged the queen to let glumdalclitch stay with me because she had always taken such good care of me the queen agreed and glumdalclitch could not hide her happiness when my master had left the palace alone the queen said to me why didn t you say goodbye to him and why did you look at him so coldly madam i must tell you i replied that since he found me my master has used me as an easy way of making money for himself he s made me work so hard that i feel tired and ill he s sold me to you only because he thinks i m going to die soon but i feel better already now that i belong to such a great and good queen the queen was clearly surprised to hear such intelligent words from such a small creature and decided to show me to her husband when the king saw me he thought at first that i must be a mechanical toy however when he heard my an swers to his questions he realized i must be alive and he could not hide his astonishment to discover what kind of animal i was he sent for three of his cleverest professors after looking at me carefully they decided that i was a creature outside the laws of nature i was much too small to climb their trees or dig their fields or kill and eat their animals they could not understand where i had come from or how i could possibly survive and when i told them that in my country there were millions just like me they did not believe me but just smiled however the king was more intelligent than they were after speaking to glumdal clitch and questioning me again he realized that my story must be true they took very good care of me the queen s workmen made a special bedroom for me it was a wooden box with windows a door and two cupboards the ceiling could be b lifted off so that glumdalclitch could change my sheets and tidy my room the workmen even made me two little chairs and a table and a lock for the door so that no rats could get in the queen became so fond of me that she could not eat without me my small table and chair were always placed on the dinner table near her left elbow and glumdalclitch stood near me in case i needed her help i ate off tiny silver plates with silver knives and forks but i never got used to seeing the queen eat in one mouthful she ate as much as twelve english farmers could eat in a whole meal she drank from a cup as big as one of our barrels and her knives were like huge swords i was quite frightened of them on wednesday which is a day of rest in brobdingnag like our sunday the king and queen always had dinner together with their children in the king s rooms i was usually invited too my little chair and table were at the king s left elbow he enjoyed very much hearing me talk about england our laws our universities our great buildings he listened so po litely that i perhaps talked a little too much about my dear country in the end he looked at me kindly but could not stop himself laughing he turned to one of his lords how amusing it is he said to him that an insect like this should talk of such important matters he thinks his country is so highly developed but i suppose even tiny crea tures like him have a hole in the ground that they call a home they argue they love they fight and they die as we do but of course the poor little animals aren t on our level i could not believe what i was hearing he was laughing at my country a country famous for its beautiful cities and palaces its great kings and queens its brave and honest people however there was nothing i could do about it and i simply had to accept the situation the worst problem i had at the palace was the queen s dwarf until i arrived he had always been the smallest person in the country he was about ten metres tall as i was much smaller than him he was very rude to me and behaved very badly especially when nobody was looking once he took a large bone from the table and stood it on the queen s plate then he took me in both hands and pushed my legs into the top of the bone i could not pull myself out and had to stay there feeling and looking extremely stupid when the queen finally saw me she could not stop herself laughing but she was angry with the dwarf at the same time in brobdingnag there are large numbers of flies in summer and these awful insects each as big as an english bird gave me no peace the dwarf used to catch some in his hands and then let them out suddenly under my nose he did this both to frighten me and amuse the queen i had to use my knife to cut them to pieces as they flew around me another time the dwarf picked me up and dropped me quickly into a bowl of milk on the table luckily i am a good swimmer so i managed to keep my head out of the milk as soon as glumdalclitch saw i was in danger she ran from the other side of the room to rescue me i was not hurt but this time the dwarf was sent away from the palace as a punishment i was very pleased i would now like to describe brobdingnag the people who draw our european maps think there is nothing but sea be tween japan and america but they are wrong brobdingnag is quite a large country joined on to northwest america but separated from the rest of america by high mountains it is about ten thousand kilometres long and from five to eight thousand wide the sea around it is so rough and there are so many rocks in the water that no large ships can land on any of the beaches this means that the people of brobdingnag do not normally have visitors from other parts of the world there are fifty one cities and a large number of towns and villages the capital stands on both sides of a river and has more than eighty thousand houses it covers three hundred and forty square kilometres the king s palace covers about eleven square kilometres the main rooms are eighty metres high the palace kitchen is huge if i described it with its great pots on the fire and the mountains of food on the tables perhaps you would not believe me travellers are often accused of not telling the truth when they return to avoid this hap pening to me i am being careful to describe what i saw as ex actly and carefully as possible more adventures in brobdingnag because i was so small i had several dangerous acci dents during my stay at the palace one day glumdal clitch put me down on the grass in the palace garden while she went for a walk with some of the queen s ladies a small white dog which belonged to one of the gardeners appeared and seemed very interested in me he took me in his mouth and carried me to his master luckily he had been well trained and did not try to bite me so i was not hurt one day the queen said to me it would be good for your health to do some rowing or sailing what do you think would you like me to arrange it for you madam i answered i d love to row or sail a little every day but where can we find a boat that s small enough leave that to me she replied and called for her work men she ordered them to make a tiny boat with sails they also made a wooden container about a hundred metres long seventeen metres wide and three metres deep this container was filled with water and i was carefully placed in my boat on the water every day i used to row or sail there while the queen and her ladies watched there was no wind of course but the ladies blew hard to move my boat along i nearly lost my life again when a lady picked me up to put me in the boat she was not careful enough and dropped me with horror i felt myself falling through the air but instead of crashing to the ground i was caught by my trousers on a pin in her clothes i had to stay there without moving a finger until glumdalclitch came running to rescue me but the greatest danger to me in brobdingnag came from a monkey one day glumdalclitch left me alone in her bedroom while she visited some of the ladies it was a warm day and her window was open i was in the box which i used as my bedroom with the door open suddenly i heard the noise of an animal jumping through the window and immediately i hid at the back of my box the monkey which appeared huge to me very soon discovered my hiding place he picked me up and held me close to him like a baby when he heard someone opening the bedroom door he jumped out of the window and ran on to the roof i thought i had never been in such great danger he was running on three legs and holding me in the fourth at any moment he could let me fall and we were at least three hun dred metres above the ground i could hear a lot of shouting in the palace the servants had realized what was happening and brought ladders to climb up on to the roof glumdalclitch was crying and hundreds of people were watching from the garden meanwhile the monkey was sitting calmly on top of the roof he was taking food from his mouth and trying to push it into my mouth he still seemed to think i was his ba by i suppose it was an amusing sight for the crowd below but i was in terrible fear of falling finally several servants climbed on the roof and as they came nearer the monkey put me down and ran away i was rescued and brought down to the ground i had to stay in bed for two weeks after this before i felt well enough to meet peo ple again the monkey was caught and killed when i next saw the king he asked me about this experi ence how did you feel he said when the monkey was holding you up on the roof sir i replied bravely i was afraid that s true but next time an animal like that attacks me i shall not hesitate i ll pull out my sword like this and i showed him what i would do and give the creature such a wound that it will never come near me again but while i waved my tiny sword in the air the king and his lords laughed loudly i had wanted to prove my bravery but i failed because to them i was only an unimportant little creature i realized later that this often happens in england when we laugh at someone of no family fortune or intelli gence who pretends to be as important as our great leaders in the next few weeks i began to have some very interest ing conversations with the king he was an intelligent un derstanding person tell me more about your country he said to me one day i would like to hear about your laws your political life and your customs tell me everything there may be something that we can usefully copy here in brobdingnag i shall be delighted sir i answered proudly our king controls our three great countries scotland ireland and eng land we grow much of our own food and our weather is nei ther too hot nor too cold there are two groups of men who make our laws one is called the house of lords they are men from the oldest and greatest families in the country the other is called the house of commons these are the most honest intelligent and sensible men in the country and are freely chosen by the people we have judges to decide punish ments for criminals and we have a large army which cannot be defeated by any other in the world while i was talking the king was making notes for sev eral days i continued my explanation and i also described british history over the last hundred years then the king asked me a large number of questions these were some of them how do you teach and train young people of good family if the last son of an old family dies how do you make new lords for the house of lords are these lords really the most suitable people to make the country s laws and in the house of commons are these men really so honest and intelligent do rich men never buy their way into this house you say the lawmakers receive no pay but are you sure that they never ac cept bribes then he asked questions about our lawcourts why are your trials so long and so expensive how much do your lawyers and judges really know about the laws how carefully do they decide between right and wrong and why he went on are you so often at war either you enjoy fighting or you have very difficult neighbours why do you need an army at all you would not be afraid of any other country if you were peaceful people and in the last hundred years you ve done nothing but rob fight and mur der your recent history shows the very worst effects of cruel ty jealousy dishonesty and madness i tried to answer the king as well as i could but he did not think our system was a good one no my little friend he said kindly but seriously i m sorry for you you ve proved to me that your country has nothing valuable to offer us perhaps once in the past your political life was adequately organized but now it is clear that there is laziness and selfishness in every part of the system your politicians can be bribed your soldiers aren t really brave your judges and lawyers are neither reasonable nor hon est and your lawmakers themselves know little and do less i sincerely hope that you who have spent most of your life trav elling have a better character than most englishmen but from what you ve told me i m afraid that your countrymen are foe worst little nation of insects that has ever crawled upon the ground i am very sorry to have to report these words of the king s and i only do so because of my love of the truth i must tell you exactly what happened even if i do not agree with it i had to listen patiently while he was giving his extraordinary opinions of my dear country we must remember however that this king lives in a country almost completely separate from the rest of the world because he does not know other countries systems or customs he has a certain narrowness of thinking which we europeans do not have of course you will find it difficult to believe what happened next sir i said i d like to give you something to thank you for your kindness to me since i arrived at the palace three or four hundred years ago we europeans discovered how to make a special powder when you set fire to it it burns and ex plodes immediately with a noise louder than thunder you can use it to shoot heavy balls of metal from large guns it can destroy the largest ships it can kill a whole army it can cut men s bodies in half it can destroy the strongest walls it s called gunpowder and it s easy and cheap to make to show you how grateful i am to you i m offering to explain how to make it then you will be able to destroy all your enemies i was very surprised by the king s reply no he cried in horror don t tell me i don t want to know how to murder people like that i would rather give half my country away than know the secret of this powder how can a tiny creature like you have such inhuman cruel ideas never speak to me of this again how strange that such an excellent king should not take the chance i was offering him no european king would hesitate for a moment but he had other strange ideas he believed very simply that every problem can be solved by honest sen sible people and that the political life of a country must have no secrets and must be open for all to see and understand of course we know that this is impossible so perhaps his opinion of us is not worth considering gulliver escapes from brobdingnag i was still hoping to return to england one day but the ship in which i had arrived in brobdingnag was the first that had ever come near the coast so i could not see how i could get away i began to think more and more about my family and my home by now i had been in brobdingnag for about two years when the king and queen travelled to the south coast glum dalclitch and i went with them i really wanted to be close to the sea again which i had not seen or even smelt for so long as glumdalclitch was ill i asked a young servant to take me down to the beach for some fresh air the boy carried me in my travelling box and put me down on the beach while he looked for birds eggs among the rocks i looked sadly at the sea but stayed in my box and after a while i fell asleep i was woken suddenly when my box was lifted high in the air i can only suppose that a large bird took hold of the ring on top of the box with his talons and flew away with it through the windows i could see the sky and clouds passing by and i could hear the noise of the bird s wings then i was falling so fast that i felt quite breathless there was a loud crash as the box fell into the sea perhaps the bird had been attacked by others and so had to drop what he was carrying luckily the box had been well made and not much sea water came in but i do not think any traveller has ever been in a worse situation than i was then i wondered how long i would survive with no food or drink in the middle of the ocean i felt sure i would never see poor glumdalclitch again and i knew how sad she would be to lose me several hours passed and then i suddenly heard a strange noise above my head people were fastening a rope to the ring then my box was pulled through the water was it a ship that was pulling me along help help i shouted as loudly as i could i was delighted to hear english voices reply who s there they cried i m english i shouted back desperately please help me to get out of here just put your finger into the ring on top of the box and lift it out of the water quickly there were great shouts of laughter he s mad i heard one man say ten men couldn t lift that huge box said another there was more laughter indeed because i had been with giants for so long i had forgotten that my countrymen were as small as me the only thing the sailors could do was to cut a hole in the top of my box and help me to climb out i was exhausted and unable to walk far they took me to their captain welcome to my ship he said kindly you re lucky we found you my men saw that huge box on the water and we decided to pull it along behind the ship then we realized there was a man inside why were you locked up in there was it a punishment for some terrible crime but tell me all about it later now you need to sleep and then eat when i told him my story a few hours later he found it difficult to believe but after a while he began to accept that what i told him must be true but why do you shout so loudly he asked we can hear you perfectly well if you speak normally you see i explained for two years i ve had to shout to make myself understood by the giants i was like a man in the street who was trying to talk to another man at the top of a very tall building and another thing your sailors all seem very small to me because i ve been used to looking up at peo ple twenty metres tall he shook his head well what a story i think you should write a book about it when you get home i stayed on the ship for several months as we sailed slowly home to england finally we arrived in bristol on june rd when i reached home my wife made me promise never to go to sea again and i thought my adventures had come to an end the flying island of laputa i had only been at home for about ten days when a friend of mine asked me to join him on a journey to the east indies i still wanted to see more of the world and as he was offering to give me double the usual pay i managed to per suade my wife to let me go the voyage took eight months and after stopping for a short time in malaysia we arrived in the gulf of tongking i ll have to stay here for a while on business my friend the captain told me but you can take the ship and some of the sailors go and see what you can buy and sell in the islands around here that sounded interesting to me so i agreed unfortunately we sailed straight into a terrible storm which drove us many miles eastward then by a very unlucky chance we were seen and chased by two pirate ships our ship was not fast enough to escape and the pirates caught us they decided to keep the sailors to help sail the ship but they did not need me i suppose i was lucky they did not kill me instead they left me alone in a small boat in the middle of the ocean with only enough food for a few days while they sailed away i am sure the pirates thought i would die however i saw land some hours later and i managed to sail the boat to it as i stepped out of the boat and walked up the beach i noticed that although the sun had been very hot the air suddenly seemed cooler at first i thought a cloud was passing over the sun but when i looked up i saw to my great astonishment a large island in the sky between me and the sun it was moving towards me and there were people running around on it i waved my arms and shouted as loudly as possible help help i cried rescue me when the island was about a hundred metres over my head they let down a seat on a chain i sat on it and was pulled up to the island i had discovered the flying island of laputa laputans are certainly strange looking people their heads always turn either to right or left one of their eyes turns in wards the other upwards their main interests are music and mathematics they spend so much time thinking abut mathe matical problems that they do not notice what is happening around them in fact rich laputans employ a servant whose job is to follow his master everywhere the servant warns him if he is going to step into a hole and reminds him to reply if someone speaks to him i was taken to see the king but had to wait for at least an hour while he struggled with a difficult mathematical question however when he had finished he spoke politely to me and ordered his servants to show me to a room for dinner they gave me three kinds of meat a square of beef a triangle of chicken and a circle of lamb even the bread was cut into mathematical shapes in the evening a teacher arrived to help me learn the language and in a few days i was able to make conversation with the island people laputa is a circle of land about eight kilometres across covered with houses and other buildings it is moved by a sim ple machine which uses magnets to pull the island closer to land or push it higher into the sky the island always moves slowly it can only fly over the country called balnibarbi which belongs to the king of laputa it is difficult talking to laputans as they have little interest in anything except music and mathematics they are howev er very worried about the future of the earth the sun and the stars and they often discuss this i heard a conversation about this shortly before i left laputa how are you my friend one man asked another as well as can be expected came the reply and how is the sun do you think i thought he looked rather feverish this morning i m afraid he ll get too hot and destroy himself one day if he goes on like this i know it s very worrying and what about the earth it s only thirty years until the next falling star comes this way and the earth was very nearly destroyed by the last one that s right we know that the next falling star is almost certain to get too close to the sun and catch fire and when the earth passes through that fire it ll be destroyed immedi ately only thirty years that s not much to look forward to is it and the two men shook their heads sadly after several months on the island i asked if i could visit the country underneath us the king agreed and ordered his officials to put me down on balnibarbi and show me round the capital lagado the most interesting place i saw there was the university which was full of very clever men with very clever ideas they were all working hard to find better faster cheaper easier ways of doing and making things they had ideas for building houses from the roof downwards turning rocks into soft material making rivers run uphill and saving sunshine in bottles i cannot remember half of the astonishingly clever ideas which they were working on one day they told me they would find the answers to all these problems and then their country would be the most wonderful place in the world meanwhile i noticed that the people looked hungry and mis erable their clothes were old and full of holes their houses were badly built and falling down there were no vegetables or corn growing in the fields when i visited the school of mathematics i could not un derstand why the students looked so unhappy what s the matter young man i asked one of them you look quite ill yes sir he answered you see we ve only just eaten our lessons for today and it s made us feel rather sick eaten them i repeated in surprise why did you do that oh that s the way we learn here sir he replied our professors write mathematical questions and answers on paper then we eat the paper after that we re only supposed to have bread and water for three days while the information moves upwards to our heads but it s awful sir not eating much for three days and we often feel sick er excuse me sir and he ran past me out of the room this highly developed system of teaching did not seem to be working well glubbdubdrib and luggnagg although the laputans were kind to me i did not want to spend a long time in their country therefore i de cided to travel from balnibarbi to the island of luggnagg from there to japan and then home to england but before i went to luggnagg an official i had met in lagado persuaded me to visit the small island of glubbdubdrib you ll find it a very interesting place he told me glubbdubdrib means the island of magicians all the impor tant people there are good at magic you see the president is the best magician of them all but i must warn you he has some very strange servants they re all ghosts by using magic he can order the ghost of any dead person to be his ser vant for twenty four hours and the ghost must obey it seemed unbelievable but it was true when we arrived on the island we were invited to the president s palace his servants certainly looked strange to me there was a smell of death about them when the president no longer needed them he waved a hand and they simply disappeared i visited the president every day during my stay and soon got used to seeing the ghosts one day the president said gulliver would you like to call a ghost it could be anyone from the beginning of the world up to the present day you could ask them questions about their lives and you can be sure they ll tell the truthghosts always do that s very kind of you sir i replied and thought hard for a moment first i d like to see alexander the great please the president pointed out of the window there in a large field was the ghost of alexander with his huge army this famous king lived long ago in macedonia in northern greece his kingdom covered many countries from greece to egypt from persia to parts of india but he died very young when he was only thirty three and no one knew why the presi dent called him into the room great king i said to him just tell me one thing were you murdered or did you die naturally young man he replied nobody murdered me i drank too much and died of a fever so in these few words i had learnt one of the secrets of history i turned to the president and now may we see julius caesar and brutus the two romans took alexander s place brutus of course had killed julius caesar in rome on th march bc one of the most famous murders in history it is terrible to die by the hand of a friend great caesar i said how do you feel about your mur derer brutus do not call him that replied caesar he is a brave good man the best in rome and he did the right thing for rome by killing me in death as in life he has always been my friend i cannot remember how many more ghosts i called to appear i was very interested in their answers to my questions which often seemed to offer a different view of his tory from the one i had been taught at school however it was soon time to leave glubbdubdrib and sail to luggnagg a much larger island to the south east of japan the luggnuggians are polite and generous people and i stayed here for three months i made many friends among them one day one of them asked me have you ever seen any of our struldbrugs i don t think so i replied what s that well a struldbrug is a human being who will never die but will live for ever if a luggnuggian baby is born with a round spot above its left eye which never disappears it s a struldbrug we have over a thousand of them in the country how wonderful i cried how exciting how lucky you are in luggnagg where a child has a chance of living for ever and how especially lucky the struldbrugs are disease disas ter and death can never touch them and imagine how much we can learn from them i expect they re among the most im portant people in the country they ve lived through history and know so much which they re certain to pass on to the rest of us if i had the chance i d like to spend my whole life listening to the intelligent conversation of these extraordinary people here in luggnagg well of course answered my luggnuggian friend with a smue we ll be delighted if you stay longer with us but i d like to know how you would plan your life if you were a struldbrug that s easy i replied first i d work hard and earn a lot of money in about two hundred years i d be the richest man in luggnagg i d study too so that i knew more about everything than the cleverest professors i d also write down everything important that happened over the years so that students of history would come to me for help i d teach young people what i had learnt but most of my time i d spend with other struldbrugs friends of mine together we could help to destroy crime in the world and begin to build a new and bet ter life for everyone i had only just finished describing the happiness of endless life when i realized that my friend s shoulders were shaking and tears of laughter were running down his face i really must explain he said you see you ve made a very understandable mistake you suppose that if someone lives for ever he is young healthy and strong for ever too and that doesn t happen our struldbrugs have a terrible life after living for about eighty years they become ill and miser able they have no friends and they can t remember much of the past at that age the law considers them to be dead so their children inherit their houses and money then they sometimes have to beg to get enough food to eat they lose their teeth and hair they forget the names of their families and the only thing they want is to die but that s impossible i realized how stupid i had been and felt very sorry for the poor struldbrugs i finally left luggnagg on a boat sailing to japan from there i found a ship which was returning to england my voy age to laputa balnibarbi glubbdubdrib and luggnagg had taken me away from home for five and a half years a voyage to the country of the houyhnhnme it was not long before i started my next voyage on th september as captain of my own ship this time the owner of the ship wanted me to sail to the indiano ocean to do some business for him there but i was very unlucky on the way i had to employ some new sailors from barbados but they were men of very bad character i heard them whispering to the other sailors several times but i did not suspect what they were planning one morning as we were sailing round the cape of good hope they attacked me and tied me up they told me they were going to take control of the ship and become pirates there was nothing i could do they left me alone on the beach of a small island in the middle of the indi an ocean as the ship sailed away i realized i had no idea where i was i found a road away from the beach and walked very quietly and carefully along in case i was attacked several strange looking animals were lying in a field and some were sitting in a tree their heads and chests were covered in hair and they had beards as well they walked sometimes on two and sometimes on four legs and could climb trees they were certainly the ugliest animals i had ever seen in all my travels when i met one of these creatures on the road his face showed great surprise and he lifted a foot high in the air i did not know if he was going to attack me or not but i hit him hard with the side of my sword he screamed so loudly that all the other animals ran to help him there were about forty of them around me i kept them away by waving my sword in the air but their wild cries frightened me and the horrible smell from their bodies made me feel sick suddenly they all ran away i noticed that a horse was com ing along the road so i supposed the animals were afraid of him the horse stopped when he saw me and seemed very surprised he neighed several times in a very intelligent gen tle way and i almost wondered if he was speaking in his own language when another horse came along the two horses walked up and down together while neighing to each other they seemed like two important people discussing a difficult problem i watched this with astonishment and decided that if the animals in this country seemed so sensible the human beings must be the most intelligent in the world the two horses then came close to me looking at my face and clothes with great interest they talked to each other a gain and then the first horse made clear signs for me to follow him he led me to a long low building inside there were several lange airy rooms with no furniture other horses were sitting or lying comfortably on the floor on clean blankets but where was the master of the house were these horses his ser vants i began to wonder if i was going mad then i realized that the house did not belong to a human but to the horse who had brought me here in this country horses not people were in control i started learning a little of their language their word houyhnhnm means a horse and the word itself sounds very like the noise a horse makes i found it very difficult to say this word and so i decided to shorten it and call them houys their servants were the horrible looking animals i had seen earlier they did all the hard work and lived in dirty little rooms in another building where they were tied to the walls to my horror these ugly animals called yahoos had human faces which looked very similar to mine i did not want anyone to think i was a yahoo so i tried to make it clear that my habits were very different from theirs at least i was allowed to sleep in a separate room from them at first i thought i would die of hunger as i could not eat the yahoos dirty meat or the houys grass and corn but i soon learnt how to bake little cakes made of corn which i ate with warm milk sometimes i caught a bird an cooked it or picked leaves of plants to eat with my bread my houy master was very interested in me and as soon as i could speak the language he asked me to explain where i had come from well master i neighed i ve come from a country on the other side of the world and you may not believe this but in my country all the important people look like yahoos but how is that possible he asked gently your houys surely wouldn t allow unintelligent creatures like yahoos to control the country it may seem strange i agreed but you see i was sur prised to find that in this country the houys are the sensitive and intelligent creatures and if i m lucky enough to return home i ll tell my friends all about it but i m afraid they may accuse me of lying my master looked quite worried what is lying he asked in their language there is no word which means telling lies and my master had great difficulty in understanding me i tried to explain oh he answered still unsure but why does anyone tell a lie there s no reason for doing it we use language in this country in order to understand each other and to give and re ceive information if you don t tell the truth how can people understand each other i began to see how different houy life was from what i was used to but tell me he continued about your country i was delighted to describe recent english history to him especially some of our most successful wars but why does one country attack another he asked there are many reasons i replied a king or his lords may want more land or there may be a difference of opinion between two countries for example whether uniforms should be black white red or grey sometimes we fight because the enemy s too strong sometimes because he isn t strong enough sometimes our neighbours want the things we have or have the things we want so we both fight until they take ours or give us theirs we often attack our best friend if we want some of his land there s always a war somewhere for this reason being a soldier is one of the best jobs you can have a soldier repeated my master i m not quite sure what that is a soldier is a yahoo who works for his king and country his orders are to kill as many people as he can i answered people who ve never hurt him asked the houy that s right i said pleased that he seemed to under stand at last soldiers have killed thousands of people in re cent history he shook his head and looked sad i think you must be what was your word ah yes lying to me how could you and your countrymen kill so many other yahoos and why would you want to i smiled as i replied proudly sir you don t know much about european war with our guns and bullets and gunpow der we can destroy a thousand ships a hundred cities and twenty thousand men you see be quiet he ordered i ve heard enough i know ya hoos are bad but i didn t realize they could possibly do such terrible things after these conversations i began to wonder whether the houys were right why do we humans so often fight wars and tell lies peace and truth began to seem more important than making war or making money i became more and more used to the houys ideas and way of life as the houys did i hated the yahoos for their dirty habits and unpleasant character by the time i had been there a year i walked and neighed like the houys i felt such a strong love for them that i planned to spend the rest of my life among them and to try to become more like them it is a great sadness to me even today that this was not possible one day my houy master said can you explain something to me why are the yahoos so violently fond of those shining stones in the fields they dig for days to get them out of the ground and hide them jealously from other yahoos i expect they ve found pieces of gold or silver i said because he did not seem to understand i added we use them as money to pay for things you see how strange he replied we share everything here no houy needs what do you call it money perhaps you can imagine how i felt i knew i could be hap py for ever with these sensible gentle creatures who never lied or stole in a country which had no disease no crime no wars but this perfect happiness did not last long i m sorry said my master one day my friends and i have decided you can t stay here any longer you see you re neither one of us nor a yahoo no i cried desperately don t send me away how can i go back to england to live with those awful yahoos i m afraid you must he replied gently my servants will help you make a boat and so two months later although i was very sad to leave i said goodbye to my dear master and his family and rowed away from the land of the houys i knew that i would never find happiness anywhere else after several days travelling eastwards i arrived in aus tralia and from there managed to find a ship returning to eu rope i did not enjoy the voyage the sailors all laughed at me because i walked and neighed like a horse they looked just like those horrible yahoos and at first i could not let them touch me or come near me their ugly faces and unpleasant smell made me feel quite ill and when i arrived home in england after being away for five years my wife and children were delighted to see me be cause they had thought i was dead but to my horror they looked and smelt like yahoos too and i told them to keep away from me even now five years later i do not let my children get close to me although i sometimes allow my wife to sit with me while i eat i try to accept my countrymen now but the proud ones who are so full of their own self importance well they had better not come near me how sad that people cannot learn from the houys i was hoping that perhaps human beings would change their ways after reading the stories of my life with the houys but they accuse me of lying in my book and now i realize that people still lie steal and fight just as they have always done and probably will always do i will say no more clearly there is no hope for human be ings i was stupid to think that i could bring reason and truth into their lives and thoughts humans are all yahoos and yaboos they will remain houyhnhnm houy the picture for several years mr williams worked for the museum at the university of oxford enlarging its already famous collection of drawings and pictures of english country houses and churches it is hard to imagine anything less alarming than collecting pictures of houses and churches but mr williams found that even this peaceful work had its unexpected dark corners he bought many pictures for the museum from the london shop of mr j w britnell twice a year mr britnell sent a list of pictures to all his regular customers who could then choose which pictures they wanted to look at before deciding whether to buy in february mr williams received a list from mr britnell with the following letter dear sir i think you might be interested in picture number in our list which i will be happy to send to you if you wish j w britnell mr williams turned to number in the list and found the following note number artist unknown picture of an english country house early nineteenth century centimetres by centimetres it did not sound very interesting and the price seemed high however mr williams added it to the pictures that he asked mr britnell to send to him the pictures arrived at the museum one saturday afternoon just after mr williams had left they were brought round to his rooms in college so that he could look at them over the weekend mr williams found them on his table when he and his friend mr binks came in to have tea picture number showed the front of quite a large country house it had three rows of windows with the door in the middle of the bottom row there were trees on both sides of the house and a large lawn in front of it the letters a w f were written in the corner of the picture mr williams thought that it was not very well done probably the work of an amateur artist and he could not understand why mr britnell thought it was worth twenty pounds he turned it over and saw that there was a piece of paper on the back with part of a name on it all he could read were the ends of two lines of writing the first said ngly hall the second ssex mr williams thought that it would be interesting to see if he could find the name of the house in one of his guidebooks be fore sending the picture back on monday morning meanwhile he put the picture on the table lit the lamp because it was now getting dark and made the tea while they were having tea his friend picked up the picture looked at it and said where s this house williams that s just what i was going to find out said williams taking a book from the shelf if you look at the back you ll see it s something hall in either essex or sussex half the name s missing you see i don t suppose you recognize the house do you no i don t said mr binks it s from britnell i suppose isn t it is it for the museum well i would buy it if the price was two pounds replied mr williams but for some reason he wants twenty pounds for it i can t think why it s not a very good picture and there aren t even any figures in it to make it more interesting i agree it s not worth twenty pounds said binks but i don t think it s too bad the light seems rather good to me and i think there is a figure here just at the edge in the front let me see said williams well it s true the light is quite well done where s the figure oh yes just the head in the very front of the picture and indeed there was right on the edge of the picturejust the head of a man or a woman who was looking towards the house williams had not noticed it before still he said though it s better than i thought at first i can t spend twenty pounds of the museum s money on a picture of a house i don t even know mr binks who had some work to finish soon left and mr williams spent the time before dinner trying to find the name of the house in his guidebooks if i knew the letter before the ngly he said to himself it would be easy enough but there are many more names ending in ngly than i thought dinner in mr williams college was at seven o clock and afterwards a few of his friends came back to his rooms to play cards during a pause in the game mr williams picked up the picture from the table without looking at it and passed it to a man named garwood who was interested in pictures garwood looked at it and said this is really a very fine picture you know williams the light is very well done in my opinion and though the figure is rather unpleasant it is quite interesting yes isn t it said williams who was too busy giving drinks to his guests to look at the picture again when his visitors had gone williams had to finish writing a letter so it was after midnight before he was ready to go to bed the picture lay face upwards on the table where garwood had left it and as williams was putting out the lamp he saw it for a moment he was too surprised to move then he slowly picked up the picture and stared at it in horror in the middle of the lawn in front of the unknown house there was a figure where there had been no figure earlier it was crawling on hands and knees towards the house and it was covered in a strange black garment with a white cross on the back after a second or two mr williams took the picture by one corner and carried it to an empty room there he locked it face downwards in a cupboard then closed and locked the door of the empty room he went back to his own room and locked the door behind him before going to bed he sat down and wrote a note describing in detail the extraordinary change in the picture since he had received it he was glad to remember that mr garwood who had looked at the picture earlier in the evening had also seen a rather unpleasant figure he decided that in the morning he must ask someone to look carefully at the picture with him and he must try very hard to discover the name of the house he would ask his neighbour mr nisbet to have breakfast with him then he would spend the morning looking for the house in his guidebooks mr nisbet arrived at nine o clock and the two men sat down to breakfast when they had finished mr williams feeling both nervous and excited hurried to the empty room he unlocked the cupboard took out the picture still face downwards and without looking at it went back to his own room and put it into nisbet s hands now nisbet he said i want you to tell me what you see in that picture describe it please in detail i ll tell you why afterwards well said nisbet i have here a picture of an english country house by moonlight moonligh are you sure oh yes the moon is shown quite clearly and there are clouds in the sky all right go on but i m sure added williams quietly that there was no moon when i first saw it well there s not much more i can say nisbet continued the house has three rows of windows five in each row except at the bottom where there s a door instead of the middle one and but what about figures said williams with great interest figures replied nisbet there aren t any what no figure on the grass in front no not a thing are you sure of course i am but there s one other thing what s that one of me windows on the ground floor on the left of the door is open is it really oh dear i suppose he s got into the house said williams with great excitement he hurried across to where nisbet was sitting and taking the picture from him saw for himself it was quite true there was no figure on the lawn and there was the open window for a moment williams was too surprised to speak then he sat down at his desk and wrote for a few minutes when he had finished he brought two papers across to nisbet he asked him to sign the first one which was nisbet s own de scription of the picture then to read the other one which was the note williams had written the night before what can it all mean asked nisbet that s what i must find out said williams now there are three things i must do first i must ask garwood exactly what he saw when he looked at the picture last night then i must have the picture photographed before it goes any further and thirdly i must find out where this house is i can take the photograph for you myself said nisbet but you know i think we are seeing something terrible happening here the question is has it already happened or is it going to happen you really must find out where this house is he looked at the picture again and shook his head i think you are right you know he has got in i m sure there will be some trouble in that house i ll tell you what i ll do said williams i ll show the picture to old doctor green he grew up in essex and he often goes to sussex to see his brother who lives there he s been going there for years he must know both places quite well that s a very good idea agreed nisbet but i think i heard green say that he was going away this weekend you re right said williams i remember now he s gone to brighton for the weekend i ll leave a note asking him to see me as soon as he returns meanwhile you take the picture and photograph it and i ll see garwood and ask him what he saw when he looked at it last night he paused you know he added i don t think twenty pounds is too much to ask for this picture after all in a short time williams returned to his room bringing mr garwood with him mr garwood said that when he had looked at the picture the figure was just starting to crawl across the lawn he remembered that it was wearing a black garment with something white on the back he was not sure if it was a cross while he was writing this down mr nisbet returned and said that he had photographed the picture what are you going to do now williams asked mr gar wood are you going to sit and watch the picture all day no i don t think we need to do that replied williams you see there has been plenty of time since i looked at it last night for the creature in the picture to finish what he wants to do but he has only gone into the house the window is open and he must still be in there i think he wants us to see what happens next anyway i don t think the picture will change much during the day i suggest that we all go for a walk after lunch and come back here for tea i ll leave the picture on my table and lock the door my servant has a key and can get in if he wants to but nobody else can the others agreed that this was a good plan they also wanted to avoid talking to anyone about this extraordinary picture knowing what excitement and argument it would cause at about five o clock they came back to mr williams rooms for tea when they entered the room they were surprised to find mr filcher the servant sitting in mr williams armchair and staring in horror at the picture on the table mr filcher had worked in the college for many years and had never before behaved in so unusual a way he seemed to feel this himself and tried to jump to his feet when the three men came in i m sorry sir he said i didn t mean to sit down that s all right robert said mr williams i was going to ask you some time what you thought of that picture well sir replied the servant of course i don t really understand pictures but i wouldn t like my little girl to see it i m sure it would give her bad dreams it doesn t seem the right kind of picture to leave lying around it could frighten anybody seeing that awful thing carrying off the poor baby that s what i think sir will you need me any more today sir thank you sir filcher left the room and the three men went at once to look at the picture there was the house as before under the moon and the clouds but the window that had been open was now shut and the figure was once more on the lawn but not crawling this time now it was walking with long steps to wards the front of the picture the moon was behind it and the black material of its garment nearly covered its face the three men were deeply thankful that they could see no more of the face than a high white forehead and a few long thin hairs its legs beneath the garment were borribly thin and its arms held something which seemed to be a child whether dead or living it was not possible to say the three friends watched the picture until it was time for dinner but it did not change at all they hurried back to williams rooms as soon as dinner was finished the picture was where they had left it but the figure had gone and the house was quiet under the moon and the clouds well said mr williams now we really must try to find where this house is they got out the guidebooks and began to work it was nearly two hours later when williams suddenly cried ha this looks like it he read aloud from the cuide to essex that he was holding anningly interesting twelfth century church containing the tombs of the francis family whose home anningly hall stands just behind the church the family is now extinct the last member of the family disappeared very mysteriously in while still a child his father sir arthur francis a well known amateur artist lived quite alone after that until he was found dead in his house three years later after he had just completed a picture of the hall as mr williams finished reading there was a knock on the door and doctor green came in he had just returned from brighton and had found williams note he agreed at once that the picture was of anningly hall which was not far from where he had grown up have you any explanation of the figure green asked williams i don t know i m sure williams doctor green replied when i was a boy some of the old people in anningly still used to talk about the disappearance of the francis child they said that sir arthur had a lot of trouble with some of the local people coming onto his land to steal his fish and his birds he decided to catch them all and have them punished and one by one he did until there was only one left this was a man called gawdy whose family had once been rich and important in that part of essex in fact some of them had their tombs in the village church too however the family had lost all their land and their money over the years and gawdy felt rather bitter about it all for a long time sir arthur could not catch him doing anything wrong until one night his men found gawdy with some dead birds in sir arthur s woods there was a fight and one of the men was shot this was just what sir arthur needed the judge was all on his side of course and poor gawdy was hanged a few days later people thought that some friend of gawdy s stole sir arthur s little boy in revenge to put an end to the francis family as well but i should say now that it looks more as if old gawdy managed the job him self brrrr i don t like to think about it let s have a drink shall we the story of the picture was told to a few people some believed it and some did not mr britnell knew nothing about it except that the picture was unusual in some way it is now in the museum and although it has been carefully watched no one has ever seen it change again j w j w a w f ngly ngly rats and if you walked through the bedrooms now you d see the dirty grey bedsheets rising and falling like the waves of the sea rising and falling with what why with the rats crawling underneath them but was it rats i ask because in another story it was not i cannot put a date to the story but i was young when i heard it and the teller was old it happened in suffolk at a place where the coast road climbs a little hill as it travels northwards at the top of the hill on the left stands a tall narrow house built about behind it are the gardens and other buildings and in front lies open heath with a view of the distant sea the house was once a well known inn though i believe few people stay there now to this inn came mr thomson a young man from the university of cambridge in search of peace and pleasant surroundings in which to study he found both the innkeeper and his wife kept a comfortable house and mr thomson was the only guest it was fine spring weather and mr thomson s days passed very happily his plan was to stay a month studying all morning walking on the heath in the afternoon and talking with the local people in the bar in the evening on one of his walks over the heath he came upon a large white stone with a square hole in the top no doubt it had once held a post of some kind he looked around him at the wide open heath and beyond that the sea shining in the bright sunlight and decided that the stone had probably once held a sign to guide the local sailors back to their homes in the bar that evening he spoke of the stone and his idea that it had perhaps once held a sign to guide sailors yes said mr betts the innkeeper i ve heard they could see it from out at sea but whatever was there fell down long before our time a good thing it did too said one of the villagers it wasn t a lucky sign that s what the old men used to say not lucky for the fishing i mean why ever not said thomson well i never saw it myself answered the other but those old fishermen had some strange ideas and i wouldn t be surprised if they pulled it down themselves it was impossible to get anything clearer than this and people soon began to talk about something else one day mr thomson decided not to have a walk in the afternoon but to continue studying he returned to his room after an early lunch and read on until about three o clock then he put down his book rose and went out into the passage thinking that he would have a rest for five minutes the house was completely silent he remembered that it was market day and everyone had gone into the local town as he stood there the idea came to him to look at the four other rooms along the passage he was sure that the bettses would not mind the room opposite his was big but had no view of the sea the next two were both smaller than his with only one window each his had two he walked down the passage to the door at the end and found that it was locked thomson decided that he must see inside that room perhaps the key of his room would unlock the door it did not so he fetched the keys from the other three rooms and tried them one of them fitted the lock and he opened the door the room had two windows looking south and west and hot bright sunshine filled the room here there was no carpet only wooden floorboards no pictures no furniture except a bed in the farther corner a metal bed covered with a bluishgrey blanket you could not imagine a more ordinary room but there was something that made thomson close the door very quickly and very quietly behind him and then lean against the wall in the passage trembling all over under the blanket someone lay and not only lay but moved it was certainly some one and not some thing be cause the shape of the head and body was clear under the blanket however it was all covered and no one lies with covered head except a dead person and this was not dead not truly dead because it was moving and shaking thomson tried to tell himself that he was imagining things but on this bright sunny day that was impossible what should he do first lock the door again with a trembling hand he turned the key in the lock but as he did so it made a little noise and at once soft footsteps were heard coming towards the door thomson ran to his room and locked himself in although he knew it was useless how could doors and locks stop what he suspected he stood listening for several minutes but no sound came from the passage now he could not think what to do he wanted to pack his bags and leave the inn at once but only that morning he had told mr and mrs betts that he would stay for another week if he left suddenly they would surely guess the reason then he thought either the bettses knew about the creature in that room but still stayed in the house or they knew nothing about it perhaps they knew just enough to make them keep the room locked but not enough to make them leave the house in any case they did not seem to be afraid of whatever was in that room so why should he be afraid of it he decided to stay another week as he had arranged as the days passed thomson listened hard for sounds from the room at the end of the passage but he heard nothing of course he could not ask mr or mrs betts about it and he did not think he could ask anyone else however he wanted very much to find some kind of explanation so he decided that he would try to see inside the locked room once again before he left the inn he made a simple plan he would arrange to leave by an afternoon train and would have his luggage put on the cart for the station then just before leaving he would go back upstairs to make sure that he had not left anything behind but instead of going to his own room he would go to the other he put oil on the key to make it easier to open the door quietly his last day arrived after lunch his luggage was taken downstairs and put on the cart for the station mr and mrs betts came to the front door to say goodbye thomson thanked them for making him so comfortable and they thanked him for staying with them then as he had planned thomson said i ll just check that i haven t left a book or anything in my room no please don t worry i can do it myself he hurried up the stairs to the locked room turned the key quietly and opened the door he almost laughed aloud leaning or perhaps sitting on the edge of the bed was nothing more than an ordinary scarecrow a scarecrow out of the garden of course just put away in the empty room yes but suddenly amusement stopped do scarecrows have bony feet do their heads roll from side to side on their shoulders have they got heavy metal chains around their necks can they get up and move across the floor with rolling head and arms close at their sides and shake with the cold thomson shut the door with a bang jumped down the stairs and fell in a faint at the door of the inn when he became conscious again mr betts was standing over him with a glass of whisky and a serious face you shouldn t do it sir said betts you shouldn t go looking into people s secrets especially when they ve done their best to make you comfortable thomson said that he was very sorry but the innkeeper and his wife found it hard to accept his apologies who knows what damage it will do to the good name of the inn said mr betts and his wife agreed at last thomson managed to make mr and mrs betts believe that he would not say anything about what he had seen by that time he had missed his train but he decided to go into town and spend the night at the station hotel before he went mr betts told him what little he knew they say he used to be the innkeeper here many years ago and he worked with the thieves who robbed and murdered travellers on the heath that s why he was hanged in chains they say up at the gallows on that white stone you saw yes the fishermen pulled the gallows down i bleieve because they saw it out at sea and they said it kept the fish away we heard all this from the peple who sold us the inn you keep that room shut up they said but don t move the bed out and you ll find there won t be any trouble and we haven t had any trouble he hasn t once come out into the house though who knows what he might do now i ve never seen him myself and i don t want to but i do hope you ll keep it a secret sir if word gets out people won t want to come and stay here will they the promise of silence was kept for many years i heard the story when mr thomson now an old man came to stay with my father i was told to take him up to his room but when we got there mr thomson stepped forward and threw the door open himself he stood there in the doorway for some moments looking carefully into every corner of the room then he turned to me i beg your pardon he said a strange way to behave i know but there is a very good reason for it a few days later i heard what the reason was and you have heard it now casting the runes th april dear mr karswell i am turning your paper on the truth of alchemy which you have kindly offered to read at our next club meeting unfortunately we do not feel able to accept your offer w gayton secretary th april dear mr karswell i am afraid that i am not able to arrange a meeting with you to discuss your offer to read a paper on alchemy however the club considered your offer most carefully and we did not refuse it until we had asked for the opinion of an expert in these matters w gayton secretary th april the secretary writes to inform mr karswell that it is impossible for him to give the name of any person or persons who were asked for an opinion on mr karswell s paper on alchemy the secretary also wishes to say that he cannot reply to any further letters on this matter and who is mr karswell asked the secretary s wife she had called at his office and had just picked up and read the last of these letters well my dear replied her husband just at present mr karswell is a very angry man all i know abut him is that he s rich lives at lufford abbey in warwickshire and considers himself to be an alchemist and i don t want to meet him for the next week or two now shall we go what have you been doing to make him angry asked the secretary s wife the usual thing my dear he sent us a paper which he wanted to read at our next meeting we showed it to edward dunning almost the only man in england who knows about these things and he said it was no good so we refused it now karswell wants to see me about it and to find out whose opinion we asked for well you ve seen my reply to that of course you mustn t say anything about it to anyone you know very well that i would never do a thing like that indeed i hope he doesn t discover that it was poor mr dunning why do you say poor mr dunning said the secretary he s a very happy man and quite rich i believe he has a comfortable home and plenty of time to spend on his hobbies i only meant that i would be sorry for him if mr karswell discovered his name and made trouble for him oh yes he would be poor mr dunning then agreed her husband the secretary and his wife were lunching with friends that day a mr and mrs bennett who came from warwickshire mrs gayton decided to ask them if they knew mr karswell however before she could do so mrs bennett said to her hus band i saw mr karswell this morning he was coming out of the british museum as i was driving past did you really said her husband i wonder what brings him up to london is he a friend of yours asked the secretary smiling at his wife oh no said mr and mrs bennett together he s one of our neighbours in warwickshire explained mrs bennett but he s not at all popular nobody knows what he does with his time and they say he believes in all kinds of strange and unpleasant things if he thinks you have been impolite to him he never forgets it and he never does anything kind for his neighbours but my dear said her husband you re forgetting the christmas party he gave for the children oh no i m not replied his wife that s a good exam ple of what i mean she turned to the secretary and his wife the first winter he was at lufford this horrible man invited all the village children to a christmas party at his house he said that he had some of these new moving pictures to show them everyone was rather surprised because they thought hat he didn t like children he used to be very angry if any of the village children came on to his land however the chil dren all went and a friend of ours mr farrer went with them to see that everything was all right and was it asked the secretary indeed it was not replied mrs bennett our friend said it was obvious that mr karswell wanted to frighten the children to death and he very nearly did so the first film was red riding hood and the wolf was so terrible that several of the smaller children had to leave the room the other films were more and more frightening at the end mr karswell showed a film of a little boy in the park surrounding lufford abbey every child in the room could recognize the place there was a horrible creature in white following the little boy at first you could see it hiding in the trees then it became clearer and clearer and at last it caught the little boy and pulled him to pieces our friend said that it gave him some very bad dreams so you can imagine how the children felt of course this was too much and mr farrer told karswell that he must stop it all mr karswell said was oh the dear children want to go home to bed do they very well just one last picture and then he showed a short film of horrible creatures with wings and lots of legs they seemed to be crawling out of the picture to get among the children of course the children were terribly frightened and they all started screaming and running out of the room some of them were quite badly hurt because they were all trying to get out of the room at the same time there was the most awful trouble in the village afterwards several of the fathers wanted to go to lufford abbey and break all the windows but the gates were locked when they got there so you see why mr karswell is not one of our friends yes agreed her husband i think karswell is a very dangerous man i feel sorry for anyone who makes an enemy of him is he the man asked the secretary who wrote a history of witchcraft about ten years ago yes that s the man replied mr bennett do you remember what the newspaers said about it yes i do said the secretary they all said that it was a really bad book in fact i knew the man who wrote the sharpest report of them all so did you of course you remember john harrington he was at cambridge with us oh very well indeed but i had heard nothing of him between the time we left university and the day i read about his accident in the newspaper what happened to him asked one of the ladies it was very strange said mr bennett he fell out of a tree and broke his neck the mystery was why he had climbed the tree in the first place there he was an ordinary man walking home along a country road late one evening and suddenly he began to run as fast as he could finally he climbed up a tree beside the road a dead branch broke he fell and was killed when they found him the next morning he had a terrible expression of fear on his face it was quite clear that he had been chased by something and people talked about mad dogs and so on but no one ever found the answer that was in and ever since then his brother henry who was also at cambridge with us has been trying to find out the truth of what happened he thinks that someone wanted to harm his brother but of course he has never been able to prove anything after a pause mr bennett asked the secretary did you ever read karswell s history of witchcraft yes i did said the secretary and was it as bad as harrington said oh yes it was badly written but what it said was very bad too although karswell seemed to believe every word of what he was saying i didn t read the book but i remember what harrington wrote about it said mr bennett if anyone wrote like that about one of my books i would never write another i m sure i don t think karswell feels the same way replied the secretary but it s half past three we must go thank you for an excellent lunch on the way home mrs gayton said i hope that horrible man karswell doesn t discover that it was mr dunning who said his paper was no good i don t think he s likely to do that replied her husband dunning won t tell him and neither shall i the only way karswell might find out is by asking the people at the british museum library for the name of anyone who studies all their old books about alchemy let s hope he won t think of that but mr karswell was a very clever man one evening later in the same week mr edward dunning was returning from the british museum library where he had been working all day to his comfortable home he lived alone there except for the two women who cooked and cleaned for him a train took him most of the way home then he caught a bus for the last mile or two he had finished reading his newspaper by the time he got on the bus so he amused himself by reading the different notices on the windows opposite him he already knew most of them quite well but there seemed to be a new one in the corner that he had not seen before it was yellow with blue letters and all he could read was the name john harrington soon the bus was nearly empty and he changed his seat so that he could read the rest of it it said remember john harrington of the laurels ashbrooke warwickshire who died th september he was allowed three months mr dunning stared at this notice for a long time he was the only passenger on the bus when it reached his stop and as he was getting off he said to the driver i was looking at that new notice on the window the blue and yellow one it s rather strange isn t it which one is that sir asked the driver i don t think i know it why this one here said mr dunning turning to point to it then he suddenly stopped the window was now quite clear the blue and yellow notice with its strange message had completely disappeared but i m sure mr dunning began staring at the window then he turned back to the driver i m sorry perhaps i imagined it he said he hurried off the bus and walked home feeling rather worried the notice had been there on the window he was sure of it but what possible explanation could there be for its disappearing like that the following afternoon mr dunning was walking from the british museum to the station when he saw some way ahead of him a man holding some leaflets ready to give to people as they passed however mr dunning did not see him give anyone a leaflet until he himself reached the place one was pushed into his hand as he passed the man s hand touched his and gave mr dunning an unpleasant surprise the hand seemed unnaturally rough and hot as mr dunning walked on he looked quickly at the leaflet and noticed the name harrington he stopped in alarm and felt in his pocket for his glasses but in that second someone took the leaflet out of his hand he turned quickly but whoever it was had disappeared and so had the man with the leaflets the next day in the british museum he was arranging his papers on the desk when he thought he heard his own name whispered behind him he turned round hurriedly knocking some of his papers on to the floor but saw no one he recognized he picked up his papers and was beginning to work when a large man at the table behind him who was just getting up to leave touched him on the shoulder may i give you these he said holding out a number of papers i think they must be yours yes they are mine thank you said mr dunning a moment later the man had left the room later mr dunning asked the librarian if he knew the large man s name oh yes that s mr karswell said the librarian in fact he asked me the other day who were the experts on alchemy so i told him that you were the only one in the country i ll introduce you if you like i m sure he d like to meet you no no please don t said dunning he is someone i would very much prefer to avoid on the way home from the museum mr dunning felt strangely unwell usually he looked forward to an evening spent alone with his books but now he wanted to be with other people unfortunately the train and the bus were unusually empty when he reached his house he was surprised to find the doctor waiting for him i m sorry dunning said the doctor i m afraid i ve had to send both your servants to hospital oh dear said mr dunning what s the matter with them they told me they d bought some fish for their lunch from a man who came to the door and it has made them quite ill i m very sorry to hear that said mr dunning it s strange said the doctor i ve spoken to the neighbours and no one else has seen anyone selling fish now don t worry they re not seriously ill but i m afraid they won t be home for two or three days why don t you come and have dinner with me this evening eight o clock you know where i live mr dunning enjoyed his evening with the doctor and returned to his lonely house at half past eleven he had got into bed and was almost asleep when he heard quite clearly the sound of his study door opening downstairs alarmed he got out of bed went to the top of the stairs and listened there were no sounds of movements or footsteps but he suddenly felt warm even hot air round his legs he went back and decided to lock himself into his room and then suddenly the electric lights all went out he put out his hand to find the matches on the table beside the bed and touched a mouth with teeth and with hair around it and not he said later the mouth of a human being in less than a second he was in another room and had locked the door and there he spent a miserable night in the dark expecting every moment to hear something trying to open the door but nothing came when it grew light he went nervously back into his bedroom and searched it everything was in its usual place he searched the whole house but found nothing it was a miserable day for mr dunning he did not want to go to the british museum in case he met karswell and he did not feel comfortable in the empty house he spent half an hour at the hospital where he found that the two women were feeling much better then he decided to go to the club for lunch there he was very glad to find his friend the secretary and they had lunch together he told gayton that his servants were in hospital but he was unwilling to speak of his other problems you poor man said the secretary we can t leave you alone with no one to cook your meals you must come and stay with us my wife and i will be delighted to have you go home after lunch and bring your things to my house this afternoon no i won t let you refuse in fact mr dunning was very happy to accept his friend s invitation the idea of spending another night alone in his house was alarming him more and more at dinner that evening mr dunning looked so unwell that the gaytons felt sorry for him and tried to make him forget his troubles but later when the two men were alone dunning became very quiet again suddenly he said gayton i think that man karswell knows that i was the person who advised you to refuse his paper gayton looked surprised what makes you think that he asked so dunning explained i don t really mind he continued but i believe that he s not a very nice person and it could be difficult if we met after this dunning sat in silence looking more and more miserable at last gayton asked him if some serious trouble was worrying him oh i m so glad you asked said dunning i feel i really must talk to someone about it do you know anything about a man named john harrington very surprised gayton could only ask why he wanted to know then dunning told him the whole story of the notice in the bus the man with the leaflets and what had happened in his own house he ended by asking again if gayton knew anything about john harrington now it was the secretary who was worried and did not quite know how to answer his friend was clearly in a very nervous condition and the story of harrington s death was alarming for anyone to hear was it possible that karswell was involved with both men in the end gayton said only that he had known harrington at cambridge and believed that he had died suddenly in he added a few details about the man and his books later when they were alone the secretary discussed the matter with his wife mrs gayton said immediately that karswell must be the link between the two men and she wondered if harrington s brother henry could perhaps help mr dunning she would ask the bennetts where henry harrington lived and then bring the two men together when they met the first thing dunning told henry harrington was of the strange ways in which he had learnt his brother s name he described his other recent experiences and asked harrington what he remembered about his brother before he died john was in a very strange condition for some time before his death it s true replied henry harrington among other things he felt that someone was following him all the time i m sure that someone was trying to harm him and your story reminds me very much of the things he experienced could there be any link between you and my brother do you think well replied dunning there is just one thing i m told that your brother wrote some very hard things about a book not long before he died and as it happens i too have done something to annoy the man who wrote that book don t tell me his name is karswell said harrington why yes it is replied dunning henry harrington looked very serious well that is the final proof i needed he said let me explain i believe that my brother john was sure that this man karswell was trying to harm him now john was very fond of music he often went to concerts in london and always kept the concert programmes afterwards about three months before he died he came back from a concert and showed me the programme i nearly missed this one he said i couldn t find mine at the end of the concert and was looking everywhere for it then my neighbour offered me his saying that he didn t need it any more i don t know who he was he was a very large man soon after this my brother told me that he felt very uncomfortable at night then one evening he was looking through all his concert programmes when he found something strange in the programme that his large neighbour had given him it was a thin piece of paper with some writing on it not normal writing it looked to me more like runic letters in red and black well we were looking at this and wondering how to give it back to its owner when the door opened and the wind blew the paper into the fire it was burnt in a moment mr dunning sat silent as harrington paused now he continued i don t know if you ever read that book of karswell s the history of witchcraft which my brother said was so badly written dunning shook his head well harrington went on after my brother died i read some of it the book was indeed badly written and a lot of it was rubbish but one bit caught my eye it was about casting the runes on people in order to harm them and i m sure that karswell was writing from personal experience i won t tell you all the details but i m certain that the large man at the concert was karswell and that the paper he gave my brother caused his death now i must ask you if anything similar has happened to you dunning told him what had happened in the british museum so karswell did actually pass you some papers said harrington have you checked them no well i think we should do so at once if you agree they went round to dunning s empty house where his papers were lying on the table as he picked them up a thin piece of paper fell to the ground a sudden wind blew it towards the open window but harrington closed the window just in time to stop the paper escaping he caught the paper in his hand i thought so he said it looks just like the one my brother was given i think you re in great danger dunning the two men discussed the problem for a long time the paper was covered in runic letters which they could not understand but both men felt certain that the message whatever it was could bring unknown horrors to its owner they agreed that the paper must be returned to karswell and that the only safe and sure way was to give it to him in person and see that he accepted it this would be difficult since karswell knew what dunning looked like i can grow a beard said dunning so that he won t recognize me but who knows when the end will come i think i know said harrington the concert where my brother was given the paper was on june th and he died on september th three months later perhaps it will be the same for me dunning said miserably he looked in his diary yes april rd was the day in the museum that brings me to july rd now harrington i would very much like to know anything you can tell me about your brother s trouble the thing that worried him most said harrington was the feeling that whenever he was alone someone was watching him after a time i began to sleep in his room and he felt better because of that but he talked a lot in his sleep what about asked dunning i think it would be better not to go into details about that replied harrington but i remember that he received a packet by post which contained a little diary my brother didn t look at it but after his death i did and found that all the pages after september th had been cut out perhaps you wonder why he went out alone on the evening he died the strange thing is that during the last week of his life all his worries seemed to disappear and he no longer felt that someone was watching or following him finally the two men made a plan harrington had a friend who lived near lufford abbey he would stay with him and watch karswell if he thought they had a chance to arrange an accidental meeting he would send a telegram to dunning meanwhile dunning had to be ready to move at any moment and had to keep the paper safe harrington went off to his friend in warwickshire and dunning was left alone he found waiting very hard and was unable to work or to take any interest in anything he felt that he was living in a black cloud that cut him off from the world he became more and more worried as may june and the first half of july passed with no word from harrington but all this time karswell remained at lufford abbey at last less than a week before july rd dunning received a telegram from his friend karswell is leaving london for france on the boat train on thursday night be ready i will come to you tonight harrington when he arrived the two men made their final plan the boat train from london stopped only once before dover at croydon west harrington would get on the train in london and find where karswell was sitting dunning would wait for the train at croydon west where harrington would look out for him dunning would make sure that his name was not on his luggage and most importantly must have the paper with him on thursday night dunning waited impatiently for the train at croydon west he now had a thick beard and was wearing glasses and felt sure that karswell would not recognize him he noticed that he no longer felt himself to be in danger but this only made him worry more because he remembered what harrington had said about his brother s last week at last the boat train arrived and he saw his friend at one of the windows it was important not to show that they knew each other so dunning got on further down the train and slowly made his way to the right compartment harrington and karswell were alone in the compartment and dunning entered and sat in the corner furthest from karswell karswell s heavy travelling coat and bag were on the seat opposite him and next to where dunning was now sitting dunning thought of hiding the paper in the coat but realized that this would not do he would have to give it to karswell and see that karswell accepted it could he hide karswell s bag in some way put the paper in it and then give the bag to him as he got off the train this was the only plan he could think of he wished desperately that he could ask harrington s advice karswell himself seemed very restless twice he stood up to look out of the window dunning was just going to try to make his bag fall off the seat when he saw a warning expression in harrington s eye karswell was watching them in the window then karswell stood up a third time opened the window and put his head outside as he stood up something fell silently to the floor and dunning saw that it was a thin wallet containing karswell s tickets in a moment dunning had pushed the paper into the pocket at the back of the wallet just then the train began to lose speed as it came into dover station and karswell closed the window and turned round may i give you this sir i think it must be yours said dunning holding out the wallet oh thank you sir replied karswell checking that they were his tickets then he put the wallet into his pocket suddenly the compartment seemed to grow dark and very hot but already harrington and dunning were opening the door and getting off the train dunning unable to stand up sat on a seat on the platform breathing deeply while harrington followed karswell the little way to the boat he saw karswell show his ticket to the ticket collector and pass on to the boat as he did so the official called after him excuse me sir has your friend got a ticket what d you mean my friend shouted karswell angrily sorry sir i thought there was someone with you apolo gized the ticket collector he turned to another official beside him did he have a dog with him or something i was sure there were two of them five minutes later there was nothing except the disappearing lights of the boat the night wind and the moon that night the two friends sat up late in their room in the hotel although the danger was past a worry remained harrington dunning said i m afraid we have sent a man to his death he murdered my brother replied harrington and he tried to murder you it is right that he should die don t you think we should warn him asked dunning how can we replied his friend we don t know where he s going he s going to abbeville said dunning i saw it on his ticket today is the st we could send a telegram in the morning to all the main hotels in abbeville saying check your ticket wallet dunning then he would have a whole day after a pause harrington agreed i see it would make you feel happier he said so we ll warn him the telegrams were sent first thing in the morning but no one knows if karswell received any of them all that is known is that on july rd a man was looking at the front of a church in abbeville when a large piece of stone fell from the roof and hit him on the head killing him immediately the police reported that nobody was on the roof at the time from papers found on the body they discovered that the dead man was an englishman named karswell some months later dunning reminded harrington that he had never told him what his brother had talked about in his sleep but harrington had only said a few words when dunning begged him to stop w w the experiment in the last days of december dr hall the village priest was working in his study when his servant entered the room in great alarm oh dr hall sir she cried what do you think the poor squire s dead what squire bowles what are you saying woman replied the priest i saw him only yesterday yes sir i know said the servant but it s true mr wickem the clerk has just brought the news on his way to ring the church bell you ll hear it yourself in a moment listen there it is and sure enough the bell then began to ring long and slow telling the people of the village that someone had died dr hall stood up this is terrible he said i must go up to the hall at once the squire was so much better yesterday it seems so sudden yes sir agreed the servant mr wickem said that the poor squire was taken ill very suddenly with a terrible pain he died very quickly and wickem said they want him buried quickly too yes yes well i must ask mrs bowles herself of mr joseph said the priest bring me my coat and hat please oh and tell mr wickem that i would like to see him when he has finished ringing the bell and he hurried off to the hall when he returned an hour later he found the clerk waiting for him there s a lot of work for you to do wickem he said and not much time to do it yes sir said wickem you ll want the family tomb opened of course no no not at all replied dr hall the poor squire said before he died that he did not want to be buried in the family tomb it is to be an earth grave in the churchyard excuse me sir said wickem very surprised do i understand you right no tomb you say and just an earth grave the poor squire was too ill to know what he was saying surely yes wickem it seems strange to me too said the priest but mr joseph tells me that his father or i should say his stepfather made his wishes very clear when he was in good health clean earth and open air you know of course the squire had some strange ideas though he never told me of this one and there s another thing wickem no coffin oh dear oh dear said wickem there ll be some talk about that and i know that old mr wright has some lovely wood for the squire s coffin he s kept it for him for years ei well said dr hall those are the squire s wishes so i m told so that s what we must do you must get the grave dug and everything ready by ten o clock tomorrow night tell wright that we shall need some lights very well sir if those are the orders i must do my best said wickem shall i send the women from the village to prepare the body no wickem that was not mentioned said the priest no doubt mr joseph will send for them if he wants them you have enough work to do without that good night wickem he paused i was just writing out the year s burials in the church records i didn t think that i d have to add squire bowles name to them the squire s burial took place as planned all the villagers and a few neighbours were present and the squire s stepson joseph walked behind the body as it was carried to the churchyard in those days nobody expected the squire s wife to come to the burial the squire had no family except his wife and stepson and he had left everything to his wife but what was everything the land house furniture pictures and sliver were all there but no money was found this was very strange squire bowles was quite a rich man he received plenty of money from his land every year his lawyers were honest but still there was no money the squire had not been mean with his money his wife had all she needed he sent joseph to school and university and he lived well but still he earned more money than he spent where was it mrs bowles and her son searched the house and grounds several times but found no money they could not understand it they sat one evening in the library discussing the problem for the twentieth time you ve been through his papers again joseph have you asked the mother yes mother and i ve found nothing what was he writing the day before he died do you know and why was he always writing to mr fowler in gloucester you know he had some strange ideas about what happens to a person s soul when he dies he was writing to mr fowler about it but he didn t finish the letter here i ll read it to you he fetched some papers from the squire s writing table and began to read my dear friend you will be interested to hear about my latest studies though i am not sure how accurate they are one writer says that for a time after death a man s soul stays close to the places he knew during life so close in fact that he can be called to speak to the living indeed he must come if he is called with the right words and these words are given in an experiment in dr moore s book which i have copied out for you but when the soul has come and has opened its mouth to speak the caller may see and hear more than he wishes which is usually to know where the dead man has hidden his money joseph stopped reading and there was silence for a moment then his mother said there was no more than that no mother nothing and have you met this mr fowler yes he came to speak once or twice at oxford well said the mother as he was a friend of the squire i think you should write to him and tell him what what has happened you will know what to say and the letter is for him after all you re right mother replied joseph i ll write to him at once and he wrote that same evening in time a letter came back from gloucester and with it a large packet and there were more evening talks in the library at the hall at the end of one evening the mother said well if you are sure do it tonight go round by the fields where no one will see you oh and here s a cloth you can use what cloth is it mother asked joseph just a cloth was the answer joseph went out by the garden door and his mother stood in the doorway thinking with her hand over her mouth then she said quietly it was the cloth to cover his face oh i wish i had not been so hurried the night was very dark and a strong wind blew loud over the black fields loud enough to drown all sounds of calling or answering if anyone did call or answer next morning joseph s mother hurried to his bedroom give me the cloth she said the servants must not find it and tell me tell me quick her son sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands looked up at her with wild red eyes we have opened his mouth he said why oh why mother did you leave his face uncovered you know how hurried i was that day she replied i had no time but do you mean that you have seen it joseph hid his face in his hands yes mother and he said you would see it too his mother gave an awful cry and caught hold of the bedpost he s angry joseph went on he was waiting for me to call him i m sure i had only just finished saying the words when i heard him like a dog growling under the earth he jumped to his feet and walked up and down the room and now he s free what can we do i cannot meet him again i cannot take the drink he drank and go where he is and i m afraid to lie here another night oh why did you do it mother we had enough as it was be quiet said his mother through dry lips it was you as much as i but why spend time talking listen to me it s only six o clock yarmouth s not far and we ve enough money to cross the sea things like him can t follow us over water we ll take the night boat to holland you see to the horses while i pack our bags joseph stared at her what will people say here you must tell the priest that we ve learnt of some of the squire s money in amsterdam and we must go to collect it go go or if you re not brave enough to do that lie here and wait for him again tonight joseph trembled and left the room that evening after dark a boatman entered an inn at yarmouth where a man and a woman were waiting with their bags on the floor beside them are you ready sir and madam he asked we sail in less than an hour my other passenger is waiting by the boat is this all your luggage he picked up the bags yes we are travelling light said joseph did you say you have other passengers for holland just one replied the boatman and he seems to travel even lighter than you do you know him asked mrs bowles she put her hand on her son s arm and they both paused in the doorway no said the boatman he keeps his face hidden but i d know him again by his voice he s got a strange way of speaking like a dog growling but you ll find that he knows you go and fetch them out he said to me and i ll wait for them here and sure enough he s coming this way now in those days women who poisoned their husbands were burnt to death the records for a certain year at norwich tell of a woman who was punished in this way and whose son was hanged afterwards no one had accused them of their crime but they told the priest of their village what they had done the name of the village must remain secret because people say there is money still hidden there dr moore s book of experiments is now in the university library at cambridge and on page this is written this experiment has often proved true to find out gold hidden in the ground robbery murder or any other thing go to the grave of a dead man call his name three times and say i call on you to leave the darkness and to come to me this night and tell me truly where the gold lies hidden then take some earth from the dead man s grave and tie it in a clean cloth and sleep with it under your right ear and wherever you lie or sleep that night he will come and tell you truly waking or sleeping oh whistle and i ll come to you my boy are you going away for the holidays professor the speaker was sitting next to the professor at dinner in st james s college yes i m leaving tomorrow said professor parkins i m learning to play golf and i m going to burnstow on the east coast for a week or two to improve my game professor parkins was a young man who took himself and everything that he did very seriously oh parkins said another man there are the remains of an old templar church at burnstow would you have a look at the place i d like to know if its worth going to see certainly said the professor i ll make some notes for you if you like there won t be much left above ground i think the place is quite near the beach about half a mile north from the globe inn i m staying at the globe in fact said parkins he sounded a little annoyed i could only get a room with two beds in it i plan to do some work there and i need a large room with a table but i really don t like the idea of having two beds in the room two beds how terrible for you parkins said a man called rogers i ll come down and use one of them for a few days i ll be a companion for you parkins gave a polite little laugh i m afraid you d find it rather dull rogers you don t play golf do you no very boring game said rogers not at all politely but if you don t want me to come just say so the truth as you always tell us never hurts professor parkins was well known for always being polite and always telling the truth and rogers often amused himself by asking questions which parkins found difficult to answer parkins tried to find an answer now that was both polite and truthful well rogers perhaps it will be a little difficult for me to work if you are there rogers laughed loudly well done parkins he said don t worry i ll let you get on with your work in peace and i can be useful and keep the ghosts away here he smiled at the others round the table while parkins face turned a deep pink oh i m sorry parkins rogers added i forgot that you don t like careless talk about ghosts that is quite true said parkins his voice got a little louder i cannot accept the idea of ghosts it is the complete opposite of everything i believe i hold as you know very strong opinons on this matter oh yes we know that said rogers well we ll talk about it again at burnstow perhaps from this conversation it will be clear that parkins was in deed a very serious young man quite unable sadly to see the funny side of anything but at the same time very brave and sincere in his opinions late the following day parkins arrived at the globe inn in burnstow and was taken to his room with the two beds of which we have heard he unpacked his things and arranged his books and papers very tidily on the large table by the window in fact the table was surrounded on three sides by windows the large central window looked straight out to sea the right one looked south over the village of burnstow and the left one looked north along the beach and the low cliff behind it between the inn and the sea there was only a piece of rough grass and then the beach over the years the sea had slowly come closer now it was no more than fifty metres away most of the people staying at the globe were there for the golf one of tnem was a colonel wilson an old soldier with a very loud voice and very strong opinions professor parkins who was as brave as he was honest spent the first day of his holiday playing golf with colonel wilson and trying to improve his game perhaps he was not wholly successful in this because by the end of the afternoon the colonel s face was a most alarming colour even his moustache looked angry and parkins decided that it would be safer not to walk back to the inn with him he thought he would walk along the beach instead and try to find the remains of the templar church he found them very easily by falling over some of the old stones in fact when he picked himself up he saw that the ground all around him was broken up with shallow holes and bits of old stone wall covered in grass the templars used to build round churches parkins remembered and even after hundreds of years there were enough grass covered stones left to show the circle of the outer wall for a time parkins walked around looking and measuring and making notes in his notebook there was a large stone in the centre of the circle and parkins noticed that the grass had been pulled away from one corner of it he knelt down and using his pocket knife dug away some more of the grass to see the stone underneath as he did so a piece of earth fell inwards showing that there was a hole under the stone he tried to light a match to see inside but the wind was too strong so he put his hand into the hole and felt around with his knife the sides top and bottom of the hole were smooth and regular he discovered it must be a man made hole in a wall as he pulled the knife out he heard the sound of metal on metal there was something in the hole he put his hand back in and his fingers found a thin piece of metal naturally enough he pulled it out and saw that it was a piece of metal pipe about ten centimetres long also manmade and clearly very old by this time it was getting too dark to do anything more so he put the metal pipe in his pocket and started to walk home along the beach in the evening half light the place seemed wild and lonely and a cold north wind blew at his back far ahead of him he could see the lights of the village but here there was only the long empty beach with its black wooden breakwaters and the shadowy whispering sea he crossed the stones higher up on the beach and went down to the sand which was easier to walk on although he had to climb over the breakwaters every few metres when he looked behind him to see how far he had come he saw that he might have a companion on his walk home a dark figure some way back seemed to be running to catch up with him but he never seemed to get any closer it couldn t be anybody he knew parkins thought so he did not wait for him however a companion he began to think would really be very welcome on that cold dark beach he suddenly remembered the stories he had read in his less sensible childhood stories of strange companions met in lonely places what would i do now he wondered if i looked back and saw a black figure with wings and a tail would i run or would i stand and fight fortunately the person behind me doesn t look like that and he seems to be as far away as when i first saw him i shall get my dinner before he does and oh dear it s nearly time for dinner now i must run at dinner the professor found the colonel much calmer than he had been in the afternoon later the two men played cards together and as parkins played cards much better than he played golf the colonel became quite friendly and they arranged to play golf together again the next day when parkins returned to his room he found the little metal pipe where he had put it on the table he looked at it carefully and realized that it was a whistle he tried to blow it but it was full of earth so he took out his knife and cleared the earth out onto a piece of paper which he then shook out of the window as he stood at the open window he was surprised to see someone standing on the grass in front of the hotel although it was almost midnight he shut the window and took the whistle over to the light to look at it again he cleaned the dirt off and found that there were letters deeply cut along the side of the whistle quis est iste qui venit now that s latin he said to himself i think it means who is this who is coming well the best way to find out is clearly to whistle for him he put the whistle to his lips and blew then stopped suddenly surprised and pleased at the sound he had made it was a soft sound but also seemed to travel a long way and it brought a picture into his mind a picture of a wide dark place at night with a fresh wind blowing and in the middle a lonely figure but at that moment a real wind made his window shake and the picture disappeared the wind was so sudden that it made him look up just in time to see the white shape of a seabird s wing outside the window he was so interested in the sound the whistle had made that he blew it again this time more loudly no picture came into his mind but a sudden and very violent wind blew his window open with a crash both candles went out and the wind seemed to be trying to pull the room to pieces for twenty seconds parkins battled to close the window again but it was like trying to push back a burglar who was fighting to get in then the wind suddenly dropped for a moment and the window banged shut and fastened itself parkins lit the candles and lookea to see what damage had been done there was nonenot even a broken window but the noise had woken the colonel in the room above parkins could hear him walking around and talking to himself the wind continued to blow for a long time beating against the house and crying like a creature in pain lying in bed listening parkins thought that a less sensible person might imagine all kinds of unpleasant things in fact after a quarter of an hour he thought that even sensible people would prefer not to hear this sound he noticed that one of his neighbours was finding it difficult to sleep too he could quite clearly hear someone not far away turning over in bed again and again sometimes when we close our eyes and try to sleep we see pictures that are so unpleasant that we have to open our eyes again to make them disappear this is what now happened to the professor every time he closed his eyes he saw the same picture there was a long beach with breakwaters running down to the sea under a dark sky he recognized it as the beach he had walked along earlier then in the distance he saw a man running along the beach climbing desperately over the breakwaters and looking back over his shoulder all the time parkins could not see his face but he knew that the man was terribly afraid he was also nearly exhausted each breakwater was harder to climb than the last will he get over this next one thought parkins it seems higher than the others yes half climbing half throwing himself the man got over and then fell to the ground unable to get up again the picture had not yet shown any cause for the man s fear but now a distant figure appeared moving very quickly it wore a long flowing garment and there was something so strange about the way it moved that parkins was very unwilling to see it any closer it stopped lifted its arms bent down towards the sand then ran still bent over down to the edge of the sea and back again now it straightened itself and moved forward along the beach at a frightening speed at last it came to the breakwater where the man lay hidden again it ran down to the sea and back again then lifted its arms and ran towards the breakwater it was always at this moment that parkins was not brave enough to keep his eyes closed any longer at last he decided to light his candle get out a book and read for a while the noise of the match and the sudden light seemed to alarm some thing near his bed a rat probably which ran away across the floor the match immediately went out but a second one burnt better and parkins lit the candle and opened his book when he finally felt sleepy he forgot for the first time in his tidy sensible life to blow out the candle and the next morning it was completely burnt down he was in his room after breakfast when the servant who cleaned the rooms came in carrying some blankets would you like any extra blankets on your bed sir she asked ah yes thank you said parkins i would like one i think it s getting colder which bed shall i put it on sir the girl asked what why the one i slept in last night replied parkins yes sir but we thought you d slept in both of them sir we had to make both of them this morning really how strange said parkins i didn t touch the other bed except to put my suitcase on it when i unpacked but you thought that someone had actually slept in it oh yes sir the sheets and blankets were thrown all over the place i thought you d had bad dreams sir oh dear said parkins well i m sorry if i made extra work for you oh i m expecting a friend of mine from cambridge to come for a few days and sleep in the other bed that will be all right i suppose oh yes sir said the girl it s no trouble i m sure thank you sir and she left the room that day parkins tried very hard to improve his game with some success and the colonel became even more friendly and quite talkative that was an extraordinary wind we had last night he said as they were playing in my part of the country they would say that someone had been whistling for it do they really believe in that kind of thing where you come from asked parkins they believe in it all over the place the colonel replied and in my experience there s usually some truth in what the country people say there was a pause in the conversation while they continued with the game then parkins said i feel i should tell you colonel that i hold very strong opinions on these matters in fact i don t believe at all in anything supernatural what cried the colonel d you mean to say that you don t believe in ghosts or anything of that kind in nothing whatever of that kind replied parkins there is an explanation for everything you see in fact he went on i blew a whistle myself last night and the wind seemed to come in answer to my call but of course the colonel stopped and looked at him whistling were you he said what kind of whistle did you use your turn to play sir parkins hit his ball and then told the colonel about finding the old whistle in the templar church well sir i d be very careful about using a thing like that said the colonel who knows what the templars used it for dangerous lot of people they were he went on to give his opinions on the church old and modern and the two men had a very enjoyable argument the morning passed so pleasantly that they continued to play golf together in the afternoon then walked back in the evening light to the globe as they turned the corner of the inn the colonel was nearly knocked down by a small boy who ran into him at high speed and then remained holding on to him and crying at first the colonel was rather annoyed but he soon saw that the boy was so frightened that he could not speak what s the matter what have you seen who has frightened you the two men asked together oh sir i saw it wave at me out of the window cried the boy and i don t like it what window said the colonel crossly explain your self boy the front window in the inn sir upstairs after several questions they learnt that the boy had been playing with his friends on the grass in front of the inn when the others had gone home for their tea he had looked up at the big front window and had seen something waving at him it was a figure of some kind in white the boy couldn t see its face but it had waved at him there was something horrible about it and it wasn t like a human being at all it was someone trying to frighten you said the colonel next time like a brave little english boy you throw a stone at it well perhaps not that but tell the people in the inn about it now here s sixpence for you and you d better run along home for your tea the two men went round to the front of the inn and looked up there was only one window that fitted the description they had heard that s very strange said parkins i remember that i locked my door when i went out this morning and the key is still in my pocket they went upstairs found that the door of the room was still locked unlocked it and went in well everything seems perfectly all right said parkins looking around except your bed said the colonel that s not my bed said parkins but it certainly looks very untidy the sheets and blankets were thrown about all over the bed parkins thought for a while ah he said i disarranged it when i was unpacking perhaps the girl came in to make the bed the boy saw her at the window and then she was called away before she could finish it well ring the bell and ask her said the colonel when the girl came she explained that she had made the bed in the morning and that no one had been in the room since the professor had left mr simpson the manager had the only other key mr simpson then came up and said that he had not been in the room himself and had not given the key to anyone else parkins checked the room carefully nothing was missing and his books and papers were as he had left them the girl made the bed again and the two men went down to have their tea that evening colonel wilson was unusually quiet and thoughtful during dinner and cards and as they were going up to their rooms he said to parkins you know where i am if you need me during the night thank you colonel but i don t expect to call on you replied parkins oh i have that whistle i told you about would you like to see it the colonel turned the whistle over in his hands looking at it carefully what are you going to do with it he asked i ll show it to the people at cambridge when i get back and probably give it to the museum if it s any good if it were mine said the colonel i d throw it into the sea right now but of course you and i don t think the same way about these things good night and he went off to his room there were no curtains at the windows in the professor s room the previous night it had not mattered but tonight there was a bright moon in a cloudless sky parkins was afraid that the moonlight might wake him up in the middle of the night so he arranged a blanket held up with a stick and his umbrella which would stop the moonlight shining on to his bed soon he was comfortably in bed where he read a book for a while then he blew out his candle and went to sleep an hour or so later he was suddenly woken by a loud crash in a moment he realized that the blanket had fallen down and a bright moon was shining on his bed should he get up and put the blanket up again or could he manage to sleep if he did not he lay in bed for several minutes trying to decide what to do all at once he turned over in bed eyes wide open listening hard there had been a movement in the other bed was it a rat the sound came again something moving in the blankets and making the bed shake no rat could make a noise like that surely suddenly his heart nearly stopped beating as a figure sat up in the empty bed parkins jumped out of his own bed and ran towards the window to get his stick as he did so the thing in the other bed slid to the floor and stood with arms stretched out between parkins and the door parkins stared at the creature in horror he could not reach the door without touching it as he passed and the thought of that touch made him feel sick now it began to move bending low and feeling its way with arms that were hidden in its flowing garment parkins realized with horror that it could not see it turned away from him and in doing so touched the bed he had just left it bent its head low and felt all over the bed in a way that made parkins tremble with fear realizing that the bed was empty the creature moved for ward into the moonlight which shone in through the window for the first time parkins saw it clearly but the only thing he could remember later was a horrible a sickeningly horrible face of crumpled cloth the expression on that face he could not or would not describe but it certainly drove him nearly mad with fear but he had no time to watch it for long with frightening speed the creature moved around the room searching and feeling and a corner of its flowing garment brushed across parkins face he screamed in horror and at once it jumped at him driving him towards the window the next moment parkins was halfway through the window backwards screaming again and again at the top of his voice and the cloth face was pushed close into his own in that final second the colonel kicked the door open and was just in time to see the frightening sight at the window when he reached the figures only one was left parkins fell forward into the room in a faint and before him on the floor lay a crumpled bedsheet the colonel asked no questions but kept everyone out of the room helped parkins back to bed and with a blanket round his shoulders spent the rest of the night in the other bed the next morning mr rogers arrived and to his surprise was very warmly welcomed by the professor the three men discussed what to do for a long time the colonel who remembered a similar experience in india supposed that the creature having no body of its own had to make one out of the sheet from the bed at the end of their talk the colonel left the hotel carrying between his finger and thumb a small piece of metal which he threw into the sea as far as a strong arm could send it later he burnt the sheet in the field be hind the globe as you can imagine professor parkins opinions on some matters are now less certain that they used to be he is also a more nervous person than he was even a coat hanging up on a door will alarm him and the sight of a scarecrow in a field late on a winter afternoon has given him more than one sleepless night quis est iste qui venit k chapter we decide to go on holiday there were four of us george and william samuel harris and myself and montmorency we were sit ting in my room and we were smoking and talking about how bad we were ill i mean of course we were all feeling in poor health and we were getting quite worried about it harris said that he felt really bad sometimes and he did not know what he was doing and then george said that he felt bad too and that he did not know what he was do ing either with me it was my heart i knew it was my heart because i had read something in a magazine about the symp toms of a bad heart i had all of them it is a most extraordinary thing but every time i read about an illness i realize that i have it too and that my symptoms are very bad in fact my health has always been a worry i remember one day i had a little health problem and i went to the british museum library to read about it i took the book off the library shelf and i began to read after some time i turned over the page and i began to read about another illness i don t remember the name of the illness but i know it was something really terrible i read about half a page and then i knew that i had that disease too i sat there for a time cold with horror slowly i beqan to turn over more pages i came to a disease which was worse than the last one i began to read about it and as i expected i had that disease too then i began to get really interested in myself so went back to the beginning of the book i started with the letter a and i read from a to z found that there was only one disease which i did not have this made me a little unhappy why didn t i have that disease too when i walked into that reading room i was a happy healthy young man when i left i was a very sick man close to death but i was talking about my heart nobody understood how ill i really was i had this bad heart when i was a boy it was with me all the time i knew that it was my heart because i had all the symptoms of a bad heart the main symptom was that i did not want to work of course nobody understood that the problem was my heart doctors were not so clever then they just thought that i was lazy why you lazy boy you they used to say get up and do some work for once in your life they did not understand that i was ill and they did not give me medicine for this illness they hit me on the side of the head it is very strange but those blows on my head often made the illness go away for a time sometimes just one blow made the sickness disappear and made me want to start work immediately anyway that evening george and william harris and i sat there for half an hour and described our illnesses to each other i explained to george and william harris how i felt when i got up in the morning william harris told us how he felt when he went to bed then george stood in front of the fire and with great feeling he showed us how he felt in the night george always thinks he is ill but really there is never any thing the matter with him you know at that monent mrs poppets my housekeeper knocked on the door she wanted to know if we were ready to have supper we smiled sadly at each other and then we said that perhaps we should try to eat something harris said that a little food helped to prevent illness so mrs poppets brought the supper in we sat down at the table and for half an hour we managed to play with some steak and chips and with a large cake that mrs poppets had made when we had made ourselves eat something we filled our glasses and we lit our pipes then we began to talk about our health again we were not quite sure what was the matter with us however we were all quite certain of one thing we had been doing too much work we need a rest harris said a rest and a change george added i agreed with george and i said that perhaps we could go to the country we could find a nice quiet place and we could sit in the warm summer sun we could go somewhere peaceful far away from other people harris said that he thought that would be awful he added that he had been to a place like that once everyone went to bed at eight o clock and he had to walk for an hour to buy cigarettes and a newspaper no harris said if you want a rest and a change then the sea is best i said that this was a terrible idea a sea trip is fine if you are going for a month or two but not for a week i know what it is like you start out on monday and you think that you are going to enjoy yourself you wave goodbye happily to your friends you walk up and down on the ship like captain cook sir francis drake or christopher columbus on tuesday you wish that you had not come on wednesday thursday and friday you wish that you were dead on saturday you are able to drink something you begin to smile a little at the kind people who ask you how you are on sunday you start to walk again and you eat a little and on monday morning as you stand and wait to get off the ship you begin to enjoy yourself i remember that a friend of mine once took a short sea trip from london to liverpool for his health he bought a return ticket but when he got to liverpool he sold it and he came back by train so i was against the sea trip not for myself you understand i am never seasick but i was afraid for george george said he would be fine in fact he said he would quite like it but he thought that harris and i would both be ill harris said he was never seasick in fact he had often tried to be ill but he had not succeeded it is very strange but when you are on land you never meet anybody who has ever been seasick so george said well let s go up the river then he added we ll have fresh air on the river the hard work on the boat will make us hungry so we ll enjoy our food we ll sleep well too harris replied well you never have any trouble sleeping anyway in fact you re always going to sleep but in the end harris agreed that it was a good idea i thought that it was a good idea too the only one who did not like the idea was montmorency it s different for me his face said you like it but i don t there s nothing for me to do i don t smoke i don t like looking at the trees and the flowers and when i m asleep you ll play about with the boat and i ll fall over the side montmorency s idea of a good time is to collect together all the most awful dogs he can find and then go round the town looking for other awful dogs to fight but we were three to one so we decided to go anyway a z chapter we start to make plans we pulled out the maps and we discussed plans we decided to start on the following saturday har ris and i would go down to kingston in the morning and take the boat up to chertsey but george could not leave the city until the afternoon george goes to sleep at a bank from ten o clock until four o clock from monday to friday on satur day they wake him up and put him out onto the street at two o clock so george was going to meet us at chertsey the next question was where to sleep at night george and i did not want to sleep in hotels at night we wanted to sleep outside how beautiful we said in the country by the river with the birds the flowers and the trees all around us i can imagine it easily at the end of the day night comes and the world is peaceful and calm our little boat moves silently into some quiet little corner on the river there we put up our tent and we cook and eat our simple supper then we fill our pipes and we sit and talk quietly sometimes we stop for a moment or two and we listen to the water as it plays gently against the boat the silver moon shines down on us and our heads are full of beautiful thoughts we sit in silence for a time we do not want to speak then we laugh quietly put away our pipes say goodnight and go to bed the peaceful sound of the water against the boat sends us to sleep and we dream we dream that the world is young again and what about when it rains harris said he was right when it rains you do not enjoy living in tents i thought about it again it is evening you are very wet there is a lot of water in the boat and everything in it is wet too you find a place on the river bank which is not as wet as other places you get out of the boat pull out the tent and two of you try to put it up because it is wet it is very heavy and then it falls on top of you you cannot get it off your head and you get angry all the time it is raining heavily it is difficult to put up a tent in good weather in wet weather it is almost impossible the other man does not help you he starts to play about you get your side of the tent up and begin to tie the ropes to the ground just then he pulls the tent from his side and he destroys all your hard work here what do you think you re doing you call out what are you doing you mean he answers angrily don t pull it you ve got it all wrong you stupid man you cry no i haven t he shouts let your side go i tell you you re wrong you scream and you wish you could get to him to hit him you pull your side of the tent hard and pull out all the ropes on his side ah the stupid fool you hear him say to himself and then suddenly he gives a violent pull and your side comes out too slowly you start to go round to his side to tell him what you think of him at the same time he begins to come round the other way to tell you what he feels and you follow each other round and round and you shout at each other until the tent falls down and there you are you stand and look at each other across the tent at the same time you both call out there you are what did i tell you meanwhile the third man has been trying to get the water out of the boat the water has run up his arms and he is wet and angry suddenly he wants to know what you are doing and why the tent is not up yet when at last the tent is up you carry the things out of the boat supper is mostly rainwater rainwater bread rainwater soup happily you have something strong to drink this brings back your interest in life until it is time to go to bed there you dream that a very large animal has suddenly sat down on you you wake up and you understand that something terrible has happened at first you think that the world has ended then you think that this cannot be true so it must be thieves or murderers or fire no help comes and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you and you cannot breathe somebody else is in trouble too you can hear his cries they are coming from under your bed you decide to fight and you hit out left and right with your arms and your legs you are shouting all the time at last you find your head in the fresh air near you you see a half dressed murderer he is waiting to kill you you are just going to start fighting him when you see that is jim at the same moment he sees that it is you oh it s you is it he says yes you answer what s happened the tent has blown down i think he says where s bill then you both shout for bill the ground underneath you moves and a voice says get off my head the next day you have no voices because you have all caught colds and all day you argue with each other in angry whispers we therefore decided that we would sleep out in tents on fine nights and in hotels when it rained montmorency was very pleased about this he does not like peace and quiet he prefers noise but he looks so good so well behaved when old ladies and gentlemen look at him tears come into their eyes when he first came to live with me i thought this dog will not be with me long he is too good for this world but by the end of the year he had killed twelve chickens which i had to pay for i had pulled him out of a hundred and four teen street fights a woman had brought me a dead cat and had called me a murderer then i changed my ideas about montmorency we had decided where to sleep so now we had to discuss what to take with us we began to argue about this so we a greed that we had done enough for one night chapter we decide what to take the following evening we discussed what we wanted to take with us harris said now get me a piece of pa per j and write everything down george you get a pencil and i ll make the list that s harris he tells everybody what to do and they do all the work i remember that my uncle podger was like harris everybody in the house had to help when uncle podger did a job when they bought a picture once aunt podger asked now where shall we put this oh i ll do it don t worry about it i ll do it all myself he said and then he took off his coat to begin he sent one of the girls out to buy some nails and then he sent one of the boys to tell her how big the nails ought to be now bill you go and get my hammer he shouted and bring me a ruler tom and jim i need a ladder and a kitchen chair too maria you stay here to hold the light and tom come here you can give me the picture then he lifted the picture up and he dropped it he tried to catch the glass and he cut himslef he looked for something to put round his finger and he could not find anything so he danced round the house and he shouted at everybody half an hour later the finger had been tied up they had bought new glass and everythng was ready uncle podger tried again everybody stood round him they were all ready to help two people held the chair a third helped him to get on it a fourth gave him a nail and a fifth passed him the hammer he took the nail and he dropped it there he said sadly now the nail s gone so everybody got down on the ground to look for it at last we found the nail but then he lost the hammer where s the hammer what did i do with the hammer there are seven of you there and you don t know where the hammer is we found the hammer for him but then he lost the place on the wall where he was going to put the picture so each one of us had to get up on the chair and look for the place and each one of us thought that it was a different place then uncle podger tried again himself this time he fell off the chair on to the piano his head and his body hit the piano at the same time the music was beautiful but uncle podger s words were not aunt maria was not pleased she said that she did not want the children to listen to those terrible words she added calmly the next time that you are going to put a picture on the wall please tell me then i can arrange to go and spend a week with my mother uncle podger got up and tried again and at midnight the picture was on the wall it was not very straight and everyone was very tired and unhappy uncle podger looked at the picture proudly and said you see it was only a little job harris is like that so i told him that george would write down the list and i would do the work he could get the pencil and the paper the first list was too long so we started again now george said we don t want to take a tent we can put a cover over the boat at night it will be like a little house lovely and warm and comfortable it s much easier than a tent then we made a list of all the clothes we needed george told us that he knew all about this kind of thing and we be lieved him we discovered later that this was not true next we talked about the food first breakfast george began we need eggs cold meat tea bread and butter of course and for dinner we can take cold chicken legs tomatoes cold meat fruit cakes chocolate we can drink water then he added and we can take a bottle of whisky too for when we are sick you know we did not wish to talk about being sick but later we were glad we had taken the whisky so we made our list and it was a long one chapter we pack the next day which was friday we collected all these things together in the evening we met to pack we got a big suitcase for the clothes there were two large baskets with lids for the food and for the pans and things to cook with we moved the table over to the window then we put everything in the middle of the floor after we had done that we sat there and we looked at it i said that i would pack i think that i am very good at packing it is one of the things that i do best so i told the others that i would organize it they agreed to this idea too quickly that was rather strange george lit his pipe and sat back in the armchair harris put his feet on the table and lit a cigarette this was not of course what i had expected when i said that i would organize it i meant that i would tell them what to do then i would sit and watch them do it however i said nothing and i started to pack the clothes it took much longer than i had expected but in the end it was finished i sat on the suitcase and closed it george and harris watched me with great interest aren t you going to put the boots in harris asked i looked round and saw the boots why did harris wait until i had closed the suitcase george laughed quietly i opened the suitcase and i put the boots in it was not easy and just as i was going to close the suitcase again an awful idea came to me had i packed my toothbrush of course i had to look for it and of course i could not find it i had to take everything out again i found george s tooth brush i found harris s toothbrush but i could not find mine in the end i found it inside a boot i packed everything again when i had finished george asked if the soap was in the suitcase i said i did not care about the soap i threw down the lid of the suitcase and i closed it again then i found my cigarettes were inside it i finished the suitcase at five past ten and the food was still not packed harris said we have to start the holiday in twelve hours perhaps george and i had better do the rest of the packing i agreed and i sat down they began quite happily i said nothing i only waited i looked at all the plates and cups and bottles and tomatoes and cakes etc i felt that it was soon going to get exciting it did they started by breaking a cup that was just to show you what they could do and to get you interested then harris packed a pan on top of a tomato and well they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon and then it was george s turn and he stepped on the butter i did not say anything but i got up and went over to the table and watched them this annoyed them more than anything and it made them worried and excited they stepped on things and they put things behind them and then they could not find them when they wanted them they packed soft things at the bottom of the basket and then put heavy things on top of them then it got worse after george got the butter off his shoe they tried to put it in the teapot at first they could not get it in then when they did get it in they decided that the teapot was the wrong place but they could not get the butter out a gain however in the end they did manage to get it out and they put it down on a chair harris sat on it and when he stood up the butter stuck to his trousers then they looked for the butter all over the room in the end george got behind harris and he saw it there it is he cried where harris asked and he turned round quickly stand still george shouted when they got the butter off harris they packed it in the teapot again montmorency was in all this of course he sat down on things just when george and harris were going to pack them he put his leg into the sugar he ran away with the teaspoons he pretended that the oranges were rats and he got into the food basket and killed three of them the packing was completed at ten to one in the morning and we all went to bed george said what time shall i wake you two harris said seven i said six in the end we said wake us at half past six george chapter we start our holiday it was mrs poppets who woke me the next morning she said do you know that it s nearly nine o clock sir what i cried and i jumped out of bed i woke harris and told him he said i thought you told us to get up at six i did i answered well why didn t you wake me then he asked now we won t be on the water until after twelve o clock then we remembered we looked at george he was still asleep now it makes me very angry when i see another man asleep and i am awake we decided to wake george we ran across the room and we pulled the bedclothes off him harris hit him with a shoe and i shouted in his ear he woke up wh aa t he began get up you fat lazy thing harris shouted it s a quarter to ten then we began to get ready and we remembered that we had packed the toothbrushes so we had to go downstairs to get them out of the suitcase finally we were ready and harris said we need a good breakfast inside us today while we were eating george got the newspaper and read us interesting pieces from it pieces about people who had been killed on the river and interesting reports about the weather the weather report for that day said rain cold wet to fine some thunder and an east wind but weather reports make me angry anyway they always tell you what the weather was like yesterday or the day before it is never tooday s weather it is always wrong i remember that one autumn i went on holiday on that holiday the weather reports in the newspaper were always wrong on monday it said heavy rain with thunder so we did not go out that day all day people passed our house they were all going out happy and smiling the sun was shining and there were no clouds in the sky ah we said as we watched them they ll be very wet when they come back though and we laughed then we sat down by the fire and read our books at twelve o clock the room was too hot and the sun was still shining well it will rain this afternoon then we told ourselves the rain never came the next morning we read that it was going to be sunny and very hot so we dressed in light clothes and we went out half an hour later it began to rain hard and a very cold wind blew up and this went on all day we came home with colds and we went to bed but on the morning of our holiday it was bright and sunny and george could not make us unhappy so he went to work harris and i finished the rest of the breakfast then we car ried all our luggage into the road we tried to get a taxi usual ly taxis come along every three minutes in fact there are usu ally too many taxis however that morning we waited twenty minutes for a taxi a crowd of interested people collected to watch us i think it was because we had so much luggage there was a big suitcase a small bag two baskets several blan kets some fruit in a brown paper bag some pans some umbrel las and four or five coats and raincoats after a very long time a taxi arrived and stopped for us we packed our things into it kicked two of montmorency s friends out of the taxi and started on our holiday the crowd of peopel waved goodbye to us chapter on the river at kingston our boat was waiting for us harris and i put all our things into it and we moved off along the river thames montmorency was at the front of the boat we travelled along the river without any accidents well there was only one little accident that was when the boat hit the river bank and harris fell over backwards when we came to hamp ton court palace harris asked me if i had ever been in the maze there he told me a story about it he went into the maze once to show a friend the way he had studied a map of the maze and so he knew it was very easy to get out of it again harris said to his friend we ll just go in and walk around for ten minutes and then we ll come out and get some lunch it s easy you see you just keep taking the first turning to the right soon after they had gone in they met some people these people said that they had been there for three quarters of an hour they said they wanted to get out harris said follow me i m going out myself in about ten minutes the people all said that harris was very kind and they began to follow him as they were going along they collected other people who wanted to get out in the end all the people in the maze were following harris there were about twenty of them some of them had thought that they were never going to see their friends and their families again one woman was carrying a baby she held on to harris s arm because she did not want to lose him harris continued to turn to the right but it seemed to be a long way at last harris s friend said to him this must be a very big maze one of the biggest in europe harris answered yes it must be his friend continued because we ve walked about three kilometres already harris began to think that it was rather strange but he went on after some time they came to a piece of cake on the ground harris s friend said that they had passed the piece of cake earlier harris replied no lmpos sible the woman with the baby said no i took it from the baby and i threw it there myself it was just before we met you in fact i wish i never had met you she added harris got angry then and he took out his map he showed it to the people but one man said a map s no good when you don t know where you are so then harris said that the best thing was to go back to the entrance and start again everybody agreed and they all turned and followed harris the other way after ten minutes they found themselves in the centre of the maze harris was going to pretend that he wanted to be in the centre but the crowd looked dangerous so harris decided to say that it was an accjdent anyway now they knew where they were on the map and it looked easy so they all started off again for the third time and three minutes later they were back in the centre again after that every time they tried again they arrived back in the centre harris took out his map again but this made the crowd angry they told him what to do with his map harris felt that the crowd was not very grateful to him then they all started to shout and in the end the keeper came he climbed up a ladder and he called to them wait there l ll come and get you but he was a young keeper and he was new to the job so when he got into the maze he could not find them then he got lost from time to time they saw him as he ran past on the other side of the hedge he shouted wait there i m coming then five minutes later he appeared again in the same place he asked them why they had moved they had to wait for one of the old keepers to come back from lunch and let them out harris said that it was a fine maze and we agreed that we would try to get george into it on the way back chapter harris gets angry harris told me about the maze as we were passing through molesey lock our boat was the only one in the lock that day usually it is very busy on sundays when the weather is fine there are boats everywhere everybody comes down to the river they wear brightly coloured clothes and the river is full of colour yellow and blue and orange and green and white and red and pink at hampton harris wanted to get out and have a look at the church there but i refused to stop i have never liked visiting churches but harris loves them he said i ve looked forward to visiting hampton church ever since we decided to make this trip he added i only came on the trip because i thought we were going there i reminded him about george i said we ve got to get the boat up to shepperton by five o clock to meet him then harris got angry with george why does george have to play around all day why has he left us with this big heavy boat to tow up and down the river why couldn t george come and do some work why didn t he take a day s holiday and come down with us the bank ha what good is he at the bank he stopped for a moment and then he continued i never see him doing any work there he sits behind a bit of glass all day and he pretends to do something what s the good of a man behind a bit of glass i have to work why can t george work what does he do at the bank what good are banks anyway they take all your money and then when you write out a cheque they send it back they say you ve spent all your money what s the good of that if george was here we could go to see that church anyway i don t be lieve he s at the bank he s playing about somewhere that s what he s doing and we ve got to do all the work i m going to get out and have a drink i told him that there were no pubs nearby and then he started shouting about the river what good is the river we ll all die of thirst no pubs it s better to let harris go on shouting when he gets angry then he gets tired and he is quiet afterwards i reminded him that we had water in the boat then he started shouting about water he said drinks like that made people ill however he said that he must drink something he climbed onto the seat and he bent down to get the bottle out of the bas ket it was at the bottom and he had to bend down lower and lower at the same time he was trying to steer the boat and he pulled the wrong rope the boat turned sharply and bumped into the bank of the river and harris fell into the basket he stood there on his head and he held on to the side of the boat his legs were in the air he could not move in case he fell over he had to stay there until i could catch his legs and pull him back and that made him more angry we stopped under the trees by kempton park and we had lunch it is very pretty there on the grass by the river under the trees we had an excellent meal and harris calmed down and began to enjoy himself again by half past three we had reached sunbury lock then we went up to walton which is quite an interesting place julius caesar stayed there with his soldiers queen elizabeth i she was there too you can never get away from that woman she was everywhere next we came to halliford and shepperton there is an old church at shepperton and i was worried in case harris wanted to go and visit it i saw him looking towards it as we came near but i moved the boat quickly and harris s cap fell into the water we had to get it back of course luckily he was very angry with me and so he forgot about his church as we came up to the lock at weybridge we saw something brightly coloured on one of the lock gates when we looked closer we saw that it was george montmorency started to bark madly i shouted and harris called out wildly george waved his cap and yelled back to us the lock keeper ran out because he thought someone had fallen in the water he seemed annoyed when he saw that no one had fallen in chapter george starts work we decided that now george was there he was going to do some work he did not want to work of course i ve had a bad day at the bank he explained harris who is sometimes a little cruel said ah and now you re going to have a bad time on the river for a change a change is good for you come on get out of the boat and tow george could not refuse really but he did say perhaps it would be better if i stayed in the boat and prepared the meal you two can tow the boat then he added it s very difficult to prepare a meal and you both look tired our only reply was to give him the rope so he started walk ing and he pulled the boat behind him sometimes people forget that they are towing a boat and later george told us a story about this george had once seen a man and a young lady who were walking by the side of the river they were pulling a rope behind them and they were talking to each other they did not notice that there was no boat on the end of the rope of course they probably had a boat on the end of the rope when they started out but it had disappeared the two young people were not worried about this they had their rope they did not seem to care that there was no boat george was going to call out to tell them about it but just then he had an idea he took hold of the rope and he tied it to his own boat then he and his three fat heavy friends sat in the back of their boat and lit their pipes and that young man and young woman towed george and his friends up to marlow it was when they reached the lock that they looked back suddenly they understood that they had been towing the wrong boat george said i ve never seen anyone look as sad as those two young people then the young man was a bit annoyed in fact he was probably going to say something angry to george and his friends but just then the young woman cried wildly oh henry then where s aunt mary did they ever get the old lady back harris asked george replied that he did not know but the most exciting thing of all is to let girls tow your boat let me tell you about it first of all you need three girls you always need three girls to tow a boat two of them hold the rope and the other one runs here and there and laughs all the time they usually begin by tying themselves up in the rope they get it round their legs and then they have to sit down to untie it next they get it round their necks when they finally get it right they always start by running they pull the boat much too fast after a few minutes they are tired and so they stop suddenly they all sit down on the grass and they start to laugh meanwhile your boat goes out into the middle of the river and it starts to turn round then they stand up and are surprised oh look they say the boat s gone into the middle of the river after this they pull you along quite well for a time then one of them decides to stop for something else so the boat runs aground in shallow water near the river bank you jump up and you push the boat off into deep water you shout to them don t stop yes what s the matter they shout back don t stop you cry loudly don t what don t stop go on go on go back emily and see what they want one of them says and emily comes back and asks what is it is anything wrong no you shout it s all right but go on don t stop why not because we can t steer the boat if you stop why not you must keep the boat moving oh all right i ll tell them are we doing everything else all right oh yes very nicely but don t stop i see oh give me my hat please it s over there you find her hat and you give it to her but then another girl comes she thinks she will have her hat too and then they take mary s hat for her mary does not want it so they bring it back then they want a comb it is about twenty minutes before they start again then at the next corner they see a cow you have to stop and leave the boat to chase the cow away anyway this time it was george who towed us on to penton hook there we discussed the important question of where to spend the night we had decided to sleep on the boat there fore we could stay there or we could go on past staines in the end we decided to continue to runnymede later we all wished we had stopped at penton hook chapter our first night on the boat after some time harris and i began to think that bell weir lock had disappeared perhaps someone has tak en it away we said george had towed the boat as far as staines and we had towed it from there it seemed to get heav ier and heavier we began to think that we were right and that someone had moved the lock but finally at half past seven we reached it and got through it by now we just wanted to eat and to go to bed so we stopped before we reached magna charta island it was quite a pretty place and we tied our boat to a big tree we were looking forward to having something to eat then but george said no it s better to put the cover on the boat first before it gets too dark all our work will be finished then we ll be able to sit down and enjoy our meal none of us had realized that it would be so difficult to fix the cover there were five pieces of metal and you put these into special holes on the side of the boat the pieces of metal were half circles and when you had put them into the holes you just had to pull the cover over them we thought it would probably take about ten minutes we were wrong we took the pieces of metal and we began to drop them into their holes you would not expect this to be dangerous work but it was first of all the pieces of metal would not fit into their holes we had to jump on them and kick them and beat them and when we got one in we found that it was the wrong piece of metal for those holes so we had to take it out again at last we got them finished then we only had to put the cover on george took one end and he fastened it over the front of the boat harris stood in the middle of the boat to take the cover from george i stayed at the back of the boat to take the end of the cover from harris george did his job all right but it was new work to harris and he did everything wrong i do not know how he did it and harris himself could not explain it later after ten minutes of really hard work he was inside the cover he could not get out he fought the cover hardand knocked george over then george got angry and he began to fight too george could not get out of the cover ei ther at the time i did not know anything about all this i did not understand what was happening anyway they had told mont morency and me to stand and wait so montmorency and i stood there and waited we could see that the cover was mov ing about quite violently however we thought that it was all necessary for the job we did nothing because they had told us to wait we also heard many bad words coming from under the cover montmorency and i decided that this was because the job was very difficult we waited for some time but everything seemed to get worse finally george s head appeared over the side of the boat it said we can t breathe under here why don t you help us you great stupid thing so i went and helped them harris s face was nearly black so i was just in time it took another half an hour after that to fix the cover and then we started to prepare supper we needed some hot water to make tea so we put the water on the stove at the front of the boat and we went to the back we pretended that we were not interested in the water at all we wanted it to think we did not care if it got hot or not we began to get the other things out that is the only way to get hot water on the river if the water knows that you are waiting for it it will never get hot you have to go away and begin your meal without it you must not look at it then you will soon hear it making a lot of noise because it wants to be made into tea it is also a good idea to talk very loudly to each other you must say that you do not want any tea that you do not need any tea and that you are not going to have any tea you get very near the water and you shout i don t want any tea do you george and george shouts back oh no i don t like tea we ll have milk this makes the water very angry and it gets hot very fast we did this and when everything else was ready the tea was ready too then we sat down to have supper we really wanted that supper we needed that supper and for thirty five minutes nobody on the boat spoke after supper we sat and smiled at each other we smiled at montmorency too we loved everybody we sat back we lit our pipes and we began to talk george told us about something very funny that happened to his father once when he was young george s father was travelling with a friend one night they stopped at a little hotel they spent the evening there with some other young men after a very happy evening they went to bed it was late and by that time they george s father and george s father s friend were feeling quite happy themselves anyway they were going to sleep in the same room but in different beds when they got into the room they dropped their light which went out so they had to undress and get into bed in the dark they thought they were getting into separate beds however because they could not see they both got into the same one one of them got in with his head at the top of the bed the other one got in on the other side of the bed he lay with his feet by the first one s head nobody spoke for a moment then george s father said joe what s the matter tom joe replied from the other end of the bed why there s a man in my bed george s father said his feet are here next to me well that s very strange tom joe answered but there s a man in my bed too what are you going to do george s father asked well i m going to throw him out joe replied so am i george s father said bravely there was a short fight and then there were two heavy bangs on the floor after a moment or two a rather sad voice said i say tom yes how have you got on well to tell the truth my man s thrown me out my man s thrown me out too i say this isn t a very good hotel is it at the end of george s story harris asked what was the name of the hotel the riverside george replied why ah it isn t the same hotel then harris answered what do you mean george asked well it s strange harris said but the same thing hap pened to my father once i ve often heard him tell the story after that we went to bed but i slept very badly chapter our first morning i woke up at six o clock the next morning and i found that george was awake too we both tried to go to sleep again but we could not this was because we did not need to get up early we could sleep for another two or three hours but we both felt we would die if we tried to sleep for another five minutes george said that the same thing had happened to him a few months before he told me a story about it at that time george had rooms in the house of a lady called mrs gippings one evening his watch stopped at a quarter past eight he did not realize this then when he went to bed he took off his watch and he did not look at it this happened in the winter so it was dark in the mornings anyway when george woke up he looked at his watch it was a quarter past eight good heavens george cried i have to be at the bank by nine o clock and he threw down the watch and jumped out of bed he had a cold bath and he dressed then he ran and looked at his watch it had started to go again and it was twenty to nine george took his watch and ran downstairs the dining room was dark and silent there was no fire no breakfast george was very angry with mrs g he decided to tell her this later in the evening then he caught hold of his coat his hat and his umbrella and ran to the front door lt was locked george said that mrs g was a lazy old woman then he unlocked the door and ran out into the street for a few hundred metres he ran as fast as he could but suddenly he noticed that there were not many people about he also noticed that the shops were not open it was a very dark and foggy morning however it seemed very strange that they had closed the shops because of the fog he had to go to work so why should other people stay in bed george could see only three people one of them was a policeman one was a man who was taking vegetables to the market and one was a taxi driver george looked at his watch it was five to nine for a moment he stood there without moving he wondered if he was dreaming he felt his wrist and bent down and felt his legs then with his watch in his hand he went up to the policeman what time is it please he asked the policeman what s the time the policeman repeated well listen just then george heard a clock one two three but that s only three times george said when it had finished well how many times do you want the policeman replied why nine of course george said and he held out his watch to the policeman do you know where you live the policeman asked george thought for a minute and then he told the policeman the address well i think you should go back there quietly the policeman continued and take your watch with you so george went back at first he thought he would go to bed again however he did not like the idea of having to get up again later so he decided to go to sleep in the armchair but he could not get to sleep he tried to read but that was no good either finally he put on his coat again and he went out for a walk he felt very lonely and miserable he met policemen who looked at him strangely they followed him about he began to feel that he really had done something wrong he started to hide in dark corners whenever he saw a policeman of course then the policemen wanted to know what he was doing george said nothing i m just going for a walk but they did not believe him in the end two policemen went back to the house with him they wanted to know if he really did live there they watched him go in with his key then they stood on the opposite side of the road and they watched the house when he got in he thought i ll light the fire and then i ll make some breakfast but he made a lot of noise and he was afraid that mrs gippings would wake up she would hear the noise and think that he was a burglar then she would open the window and shout help police the two policemen would come and arrest george and take him away so he stopped trying to prepare breakfast and he put on his coat then he sat in the armchair and he waited for mrs gippings she came down at half past seven george said that since then he had never got up too early again when george had finished his story we decided to wake up harris it was hard work in the end we had to use quite a sharp piece of metal harris sat up suddenly then montmoren cy had been asleep on harris s chest and he went flying across the boat after that we pulled up the cover and we put our heads over the side of the boat we looked down at the water the night before we had decided to get up early we would throw off the cover and we would jump into the water with shouts of happi ness then we would enjoy a long swim but now that morning had come it did not seem to be a very good idea the water looked wet and cold the wind felt cold too well who s going to go in for a swim first harris said fi nally nobody hurried to be the first one george put his head back inside the boat montmorency barked with horror at the idea harris said it would he difficult to climb back into the boat a gain from the water then he went back into the boat to look for his trousers i did not want to give up the idea absolutely i decided to go down to the edge of the river and then splash some water over myself so i went out on to the river bank and i began to move carefully along the branch of a tree which was over the water it was very cold and i thought i would not splash water over myself after all i would go back into the boat and dress i turnedand just then the stupid branch broke the next minute i was in the middle of the river with half a litre of the thames inside me good heavens old j s gone in harris said is it all right george called out lovely i replied why don t you come in but they did not want to when i got back to the boat i was very cold i wanted to put on my shirt as quickly as possible by accident i dropped it into the water this made me very angry but george started to laugh i can t see anything to laugh at i told george he just went on laughing in fact i never saw a man laugh so much in the end i became really angry with him i told him what i thought about him he laughed more loudly and then just as i was getting the shirt back out of the water i noticed that it was not my shirt so i began to laugh too i looked at george who was laughing so much then i looked at the wet shirtand i laughed more and more because i was laughing so much i dropped the shirt in the water again aren t you going to get it out george cried between his shouts of laughter at first i could not answer him because i was laughing so much in the end i managed to say it isn t my shirt it s yours i have never seen a man s face change so quickly i tried to make him see that it was very funny but he did not agree with me after that it was time for breakfast and we decided to have eggs harris said he would cook them he said he was very good at doing eggs people who had eaten his eggs never want ed any other food afterwards if they can t get my eggs they won t eat he said and they die so we gave him the pan and all the eggs which had not bro ken go on then we said begin harris had some trouble when he tried to break the eggs he had trouble stopping them from getting onto his trousers and he had more trouble trying to stop them from going up his arms finally he managed to get about six of the eggs into the pan then he sat down and started to cook them it seemed to be very difficult work whenever he went near the pan he burnt himself then he dropped everything and danced about and waved his hands and shouted in fact every time george and i looked at him he was doing this at first we thought it was necessary to do this to cook the eggs once montmorency went and looked into the pan but he burnt himself then he started dancing and shouting too it was all very exciting and george and i were quite sorry when it finished chapter hotels and tinned fruit after breakfast i was sitting by the river and thinking when george said perhaps when you ve rested enough you could help to wash the plates and things so i cleaned the pan with some wood and grass and george s wet shirt then we started to move up the river again past old wind sor which is very pretty after that the river is not very inter esting until you get to boveney george and i were towing the boat then as we were passing datchet george asked me if i remembered our first trip up the river on that trip we reached datchet at ten o clock at night all we wanted to do was to eat and go to bed i replied yes i do remember it i remember it well in fact it will be some time before i forget it it was one saturday in august there was george and harris and me we were tired and hungry when we got to datchet we took out of the boat the basket of food the two bags and the coats and things then we began to look for somewhere to stay we passed a very pretty little hotel but there were no roses round the door i wanted somewhere with roses round the door i do not know why anyway i said oh we don t want to go there let s look for a little hotel with roses round the door so we went on until we came to another hotel that was a very nice one too and it did have roses but harris did not like the man who was standing by the front door harris said that he did not look like a nice man and he was wearing ugly boots so we went on we walked for some time but we did not see any more hotels then we met a man and we decided to ask him excuse me do you know any nice little hotels near here we said well he said you re coming away from them go back and you ll come to the black horse we said oh we ve been there and we didn t like it there were no roses round the door well then he said there s the travellers rest just beyond it have you tried that harris replied that we did not want to go there we did not like the man who was staying there harris did not like the colour of his hair he did not like his boots either well i don t koow what you re going to do then the man answered because they are the only two hotels here no other hotels harris cried none the man replied what are we going to do now harris asked then george spoke he said you two can ask someone to build you a hotel i m going back to the black horse so we went back to the black horse good evening the man at the desk said oh good evening george answered we want three beds please i m sorry sir the man replied but we haven t got three beds oh wgll it doesn t matter two beds then two of us can sleep in one bed can t we george continued he looked at harris and me harris said oh yes he thought that george and i could sleep in one bed very easily i m very sorry sir the man repeated we haven t got any beds we ve already got three men in one bed we picked up our things and we went over to the travellers rest it was a pretty little place i said i thought it was better than the other hotel harris said it would be all right we would not look at the man with red hair and ugly boots the people at the travellers rest did not wait to hear what we wanted the lady at the desk said she had already sent away fourteen people there was no room of any kind we asked her if she knew somewhere we could spend the night she said there was a little house along the road we did not wait we picked up the basket the bags and the coats and we ran along the road the people there laughed at us there were only three beds in the house and there were seven men there already someone said why don t you try the little shop next to the black horse so we went back along the road but there were no beds at the little shop however there was an old lady in the shop she said she had a friend who had some rooms she added that she would take us there the old woman walked very slowly and it took us twenty minutes to get to her friend s house during the walk she told us about all the pains she had in her back when we got there there were already some people in her friend s rooms from there we went to number number was full they sent us to number and number was full then we went back along the road suddenly harris sat down on the basket he said he was not going to move he added that it seemed to be nice and quiet there and he said that he would like to die there just then a little boy came past do you know any old people that we can frighten so that they will give us their beds we asked him no i don t the boy answered but he added that his mother would give us a room and that was where we spent the night in two very short beds after that we were never quite so difficult about hotels on our present trip though nothing exciting happened we continued slowly on our way and we stopped for lunch near monkey island we decided to have cold meat for lunch then after that george brought out a tin of fruit we love tinned fruit all three of us we looked at the picture on the tin we thought about the fruit we imagined the taste of it we smiled at each other and harris got out a spoon then we looked for the tin opener we took everything out of the big basket we took everything out of the bags there was no tin opener we pulled up the boards at the bottom of the boat we put everything out on the grass by the river and we shook every thing there was no tin opener then harris tried to open the tin with a little knife and he cut himself badly george tried with some scissors the scissors flew up and nearly hit him in the eye i tried to make a hole in the tin with the sharp end of a piece of metal but i missed as a result i fell in the water and the tin flew away and broke a cup then we all got angry we took that tin and we put it on the grass by the river harris went into a field and got a big sharp stone i got a long thick piece of wood george held the tin and harris put the sharp end of his stone against the top of it i took the piece of wood and held it high in the air then i brought it down as hard as i could it was george s hat that saved his life that day he keeps that hat now on a winter evening when men are telling sto ries about the dangers they have known george brings out his hat he shows it to his friends then he tells the story again and he adds more details to it each time harris was not hurt too badly after that i took the tin away i beat it until i was exhaust ed and miserable then harris took it we beat it until it was long and thin we beat it until it was square we hit it with the wood until it was every shape there is but we could not make a hole in it then george tried and he knocked it into a shape which was strange and terrible and ugly it frightened him and he threw away the piece of wood then the three of us sat round that tin on the grass and we looked at it there was one big line across the top of the tin that looked like a mouth it seemed to be laughing at us and this made us very angry so harris ran at it and picked it up he threw it as hard as he could into the middle of the river as it went down into the water we shouted awful things at it then we got into the boat and we left that place and did not stop until we reached maidenhead we went through maidenhead quickly but after that we travelled along more slowly we stopped for tea just before we got to cookham by the time we got through the lock it was evening it was a bit windy and someone had made a mistake because the wind was behind us that does not usually happen but that afternoon the wind actually helped us on our way and the boat moved quite fast there were no other people on the river except for three old men they were sitting in a boat and they were fishing as we got nearer we could see that they were old they were also quite serious because they were watching their fishing lines very carefully the sun was going down and it threw a red light across the water it was very beautiful and we felt that we were sailing into some strange land we did not sail into some strange land we went straight in to that boat with the three old men in it at first we did not know what had happened but then from the words which rose on the evening air we understood that we were near peo ple we also understood that those people were not happy we had knocked those three old men from their seats and they were all lying on the bottom of their boat they were trying to stand up and they were picking fish off themselves as they worked they shouted unkind things about us not just the usual things but special things about us and about our families harris called out you ought to be pleased that something so exciting has happened to you he added that he was very unhappy to hear men of their age use those bad words but the three old men did not seem to agree with harris at marlow we left the boat near the bridge and we went to spend the night in a hotel chapter montmorency and the cat on monday morning we got up quite early and we went to swim before breakfast on the way back mont morency behaved very stupidly the only thing that montmorency and i disagree about is cats i like cats montmorency does not when i meet a cat i say hello to it then i bend down and i stroke it gently behind the ears and along the side of its head the cat likes this it puts its tail up and it pushes itself against my legs and there is love and peace when montmorency meets a cat everybody knows about it and a lot of bad words are used i do not really blame montmorency usually i just hit him or throw stones at him because dogs are like that they hate cats but that morning montmorency wished that he had not argued with a cat as we were coming back from the river a cat ran out from one of the houses and it began to walk across the road mont morency saw the cat gave a shout of real happiness and ran af ter it it was a big black cat i have never seen a bigger cat it had lost half its tail and one of its ears but it looked calm and hap py montmorency ran at that cat as fast as he could but the cat did not hurry it did not seem to understand that its life was in danger it walked on quietly until the enemy was near it then it turned and sat down in the middle of the road it looked at montmorency in a quiet way and it seemed to say yes you want me montmorency is quite a brave dog but there was something in the way the cat looked at him it frightened him he stopped suddenly and he looked at the cat they did not speak of course but it was easy to imagine their conversation the cat can i do anything for you montmorency no no thanks the cat do please tell me if there is something you want won t you montmorency who moves backwards down the road oh no not at all certainly i i m afraid i ve made a mistake i thought i knew you i m sorry the cat notat all are you quite sure you don t want any thing now montmorency who continues to move back not at all thanks not at all very kind of you good morning the cat good morning then the cat stood up and continued along the road mont morency with his tail between his legs walked behind us he hoped that nobody would notice him now if you say cats to montmorency he looks up at you and his eyes beg you no please after this we did our shopping went back to the boat and moved off along the river again however at hambledon lock we found that we had no water so we went to ask the lock keeper for some george spoke for us he said oh please could you give us a little water of course the old man replied just take what you want and leave the rest thank you very much george said and he looked round but where is it it s where it always is my boy the lock keeper answered it s behind you george looked round again i can t see it he said why where are your eyes the man said and he turned george towards the river oh george cried but we can t drink the river you know no but you can drink some of it the old man replied that s what i ve drunk for fifteen years we got some water from another house after we had got our water we went on towards wargrave but before we got there we stopped for lunch we were sitting in a field near the river and we were just going to start eating harris was preparing the food and george and i were waiting with our plates have you got a spoon harris asked i need a spoon the basket was behind us and george and i both turned to get a spoon it took about five seconds when we looked back again harris and the food had gone it was an open field and there were no trees there was nowhere to hide he had not fallen in the river because we were between him and the water george and i looked round then we looked at each other harris had gone disappeared sadly we looked again at the place where harris and the food had been and then to our horror we saw harris s head and only his head in the grass the face was very red and very angry george was the first to speak say something he cried are you alive or dead where is the rest of you oh don t be so stupid harris s head said it s your fault you made me sit there you did it to annoy me here take the food and from the middle of the grass the food appeared and then harris came out dirty and wet harris had not known that he had been sitting on the edge of a hole the grass had hidden it then suddenly he had fall en backwards into it he said he had not known what was hap pening to him he thought at first that it was the end of the world harris still believes that george and i planned it chapter harris and the swans after lunch we moved on to wargrave and shiplake and then to sonning we got out of the boat there and we walked about for an hour or more it was too late then to go on past reading so we decided to go back to one of the shiplake islands we would spend the night there when we had tied the boat up by one of the islands it was still early george said it would be a good idea to have a really excellent supper he said we could use all kinds of things and all the bits of food we had left we could make it really inter esting and we could put everything into one big pan together george said he would show us how to do it we liked this idea so george collected wood to make a fire harris and i started to prepare the potatoes this became a very big job we began quite happily however by the time we had finished our first potato we were feeling very miserable there was almost no potato left george came and looked at it oh that s no good you ve done it wrong do it like this he said we worked very hard for twenty five minutes at the end of that time we had done four potatoes we refused to continue george said it was stupid to have only four potatoes so we washed about six more then we put them in the pan without doing anything else to them we also put in some carrots and other vegetables but george looked at it and he said there was not enough so then we got out both the food baskets we took out all the bits of things that were left and we put them in too in fact we put in everything we could find i remember that montmorency watched all this and he looked very thoughtful then he walked away he came back a few minutes later with a dead rat in his mouth he wanted to give it to us for the meal we did not know if he really wanted to put it in the pan or if he wanted to tell us what he thought about the meal harris said he thought it would be all right to put the rat in however george did not want to try anything new it was a very good meal it was different from other meals the potatoes were a bit hard but we had good teeth so it did not really matter after supper harris was rather disagreeable i think it was the meal which caused this he is not used to such rich food george and i decided to go for a walk in henley but we left harris in the boat he said he was going to have a glass of whisky smoke his pipe and then get the boat ready for the night we were on an island so when we came back we would shout from the river bank then harris would come in the boat and get us when we left we said to him don t go to sleep henley was very busy and we met quite a lot of people we knew in town the time passed very quickly when we started off on our long walk back it was eleven o clock it was a dark and miserable night it was quite cold and it was raining a bit we walked through the dark silent fields and we talked quietly to each other we wondered if we were going the right way we thought of our nice warm comfort able boat we thought of harris and montmorency and the whisky and we wished that we were there we imagined that we were inside our warm little boat tired and a little hungry with the dark miserable river outside we could see ourselves we were sitting down to supper there we were passing cold meat and thick pieces of bread to each other we could hear the happy sounds of our knives and our laughing voices we hurried to make it real after some time we found the river and that made us happy we knew that we were going the right way we passed shiplake at a quarter to twelve and then george said quite slowly you don t remember which island it was do you no i don t i replied and i began to think carefully how many are there only four george answered it ll be all right if harris is awake and if he isn t awake i asked but we decided not to think about that when we arrived opposite the first island we shouted but there was no answer so we went to the second island and we tried there the result was the same oh i remember now george said it was the third one and full of hope we ran to the third one and we called out there was no answer it was now becoming serious it was after midnight the ho tels were all full and we could not go round all the houses and knock on doors at midnight george said that perhaps we could go back to henley find a policeman and hit him he would arrest us and take us to a police station and then we would have somewhere to sleep but then we thought per haps he won t arrest us perhaps he ll just hit us too we could not fight policemen all night we tried the fourth island but there was still no reply it was raining hard now and it was not going to stop we were very cold and wet and miserable we began to wonder if there were only four islands or if we were on the wrong bit of the river everything looked strange and different in the darkness just when we had lost all hope i suddenly saw a strange light it was over by the trees on the opposite side of the river i shouted as loudly as i could we waited in silence for a moment and then oh how happy we were we heard montmorency bark we continued to shout for about five minutes and then we saw the lights of the boat it was coming towards us slowly we heard harris s sleepy voice he was asking where we were harris seemed very strange it was more than tiredness he brought the boat to our side of the river he stopped at a place where we could not get into the boat and then immediately he fell asleep we had to scream and yell to wake him up again at last we did wake him up and we got into the boat harris looked very sad in fact he looked like a man who had had a lot of trouble we asked him if anything had hap pened and he said swans we had left the boat near a swan s nest and soon after george and i had left mrs swan came back she started to shout at harris however harris managed to chase her away and she went to fetch her husband harris said he had had quite a hard battle with these two swans but he had fought bravely and in the end he defeated them half an hour later they returned with eighteen more swans there was another terrible battle harris said the swans had tried to pull him and montmorency from the boat and drown them but once again harris fought bravely for four hours and he had killed them all then they had all swum away to die how many swans did you say there were george asked thirty two harris replied sleepily you said eighteen before george said no i didn t harris answered i said twelve do you think i can t count we never discovered what had really happened we asked harris about it the next morning but he said what swans and he seemed to think that george and i had been dreaming oh how wonderful it was to be in the boat again we ate a very good supper and then we thought we would have some whisky but we could not find it we asked harris what he had done with it but he did not seem to understand the expres sion on montmorency s face told us that he knew something but he said nothing i slept well that night although harris did wake me up ten times or more he was looking for his clothes he seemed to be worrying about his clothes all night twice he made george and me get up because he wanted to see if we were lying on his trousers george got quite angry the second time whatever do you want your trousers for it s the middle of the night he cried why don t you lie down and go to sleep the next time i woke up harris said he could not find his shoes and i can remember that once he pushed me over onto my side wherever can that umbrella be he was saying chapter work washing and fishing we woke up late the next morning and it was about ten o clock when we moved off we had already decided that we wanted to make this a good day s journey we agreed that we would row and not tow the boat harris said that george and i should row and he would steer i did not like this idea at all i said that he and george should row so that i could rest a little i thought that i was doing too much of the work on this trip i was beginning to feel strongly about it i always think that i am doing too much work it is not be cause i do not like work i do like it i find it very interesting i can sit and look at it for hours you cannot give me too much work i like to collect it my study is full of it and i am very careful with my work too why some of the work in my study has been there for years and it has not got dirty or anything that is because i take care of it however although i love work i do not want to take other poople s work from them but i get it without asking for it and this worries me george says that i should not worry about it in fact he thinks that perhaps i should have more work however i ex pect he only says that to make me feel better in a boat i have noticed that each person thinks that he is doing all the work harris s idea was that both george and i had let him do all the work george said that harris never did anything except eat and sleep he george had done all the work he said that he had never met such lazy people as harris and me that amused harris george work he laughed if george worked for half an hour it would kill him have you ever seen george work he added and he turned to me i agreed with harris that i had never seen george work well how can you know george answered harris you re always asleep have you ever seen harris awake ex cept at meal times george asked me i had to tell the truth and agree with george harris had done very little work in the boat oh come on i ve done more than old j anyway harris replied well it would be difficult to do less george added oh him he thinks he s a passenger and doesn t need to work harris said and that was how grateful they were to me after i had brought them and their old boat all the way up from kingston after i had organized everything for them and after i had tak en care of them finally we decided that harris and george would row until we got past reading and then i would tow the boat from there we reached reading at about eleven o clock we did not stay long though because the river is dirty there however af ter that it becomes very beautiful goring on the left and streatley on the right are both very pretty places earlier we had decided to go on to wallingford that day but the river was lovely at streatley we left our boat at the bridge and we went into the village we had lunch at a little pub and montmorency enjoyed that we stayed at streatley for two days and we took our clothes to be washed we had tried to wash them ourselves in the river and george had told us what to do this was not a suc cess before we washed them they were very very dirty but we could just wear them after we had washed them they were worse than before however the river between reading and henley was cleaner because we had taken all the dirt from it and we had washed it into our clothes the woman who washed them at streatley made us pay three times the usual price we paid her and did not say a word about the cost the river near streatley and goring is excellent for fishing you can sit and fish there all day some people do sit and fish all day they never catch any fish of course you may catch a dead cat or two but you will not catch any fish when you go for a walk by the river the fish come and stand half out of the water with their mouths open for bread and if you go swimming they all come and stare at you and get in your way but you cannot catch them on the second evening george and i and montmorency i do not know where harris was went for a walk to walling ford on the way back to the boat we stopped at a little pub by the river we went in and sat down there was an old man there he was smoking a pipe and we began to talk to him he told us that it had been a fine day today and we told him that it had been a fine day yesterday then we all told each other that we thought it would be a fine day tomorrow we told him that we were on holiday on the river and that we were going to leave the next day then we stopped talking for a few minutes and we began to look round the room we noticed a glass case on the wall in it there was a very big fish the old man saw that we were looking at this fish ah he said that s a big fish isn t it yes it is i replied yes the old man continued it was sixteen years ago i caught him just by the bridge did you really george asked yes the man answered they told me he was in the river i said i d catch him and i did you don t see many fish as big as that one now well good night then and he went out after that we could not take our eyes off the fish it really was a fine fish we were still looking at it when another man came in he had a glass of beer in his hand and he also looked at the fish that s a fine big fish isn t it george said to him ah yes the man replied he drank some of his beer and then he added perhaps you weren t here when it was caught no we said and we explained that we did not live there we said that we were only there on holiday ah well the man went on it was nearly five years ago that i caught that fish oh did you catch it then i asked yes he replied i caught him by the lock well good night to you five minutes later a third man came in and described how he had caught the fish early one morning he left and another man came in and sat down by the window nobody spoke for some time then george turned to the man and said excuse me i hope you don t mind but my friend and i who are only on holiday here would like to ask you a question could you tell us how you caught that fish who told you that i caught that fish he asked we said that nobody had told us we just felt that he was the man who had caught it well that s very strange he answered with a little laugh you re right i did catch it and he went on to tell us how he had done it and that it had taken him half an hour to land it when he left the landlord came in to talk to us we told him the different stories we had heard about his fish he was very amused and we all laughed about it and then he told us the re al story of the fish he said that he had caught it himself years ago when he was a boy it was a lovely sunny afternoon and instead of go ing to school he went fishing that was when he caught the fish everyone thought he was very clever even his teacher thought he had done well and did not punish him he had to go out of the room just then and we turned to look at the fish again george became very excited about it and he climbed up onto a chair to see it better and then george fell and he caught hold of the glass case to save himself it came down with george and the chair on top of it is the fish all right i cried i hope so george said he stood up carefully and looked round but the fish was lying on the floor in a thousand pieces it was not a real fish chapter on to oxford we left streatley early the next morning we were going to culham and we wanted to spend the night there between streatley and walling ford the river is not very inter esting then from cleeve there is quite a long piece of the river which has no locks most people are pleased about this because it makes everything much easier but i quite like locks myself i remember that george and i nearly had an accident in a lock once it was a lovely day and there were a lot of boats in the lock someone was taking a photograph of us all and the photographer was hoping to sell the picture to the people in the lock i did not see the photographer at first but suddenly george started to brush his trousers and he fixed his hair and put on his hat then he sat down with a kind but sad expression on his face and he tried to hide his feet my first idea was that he had seen a girl that he knew and i looked round to see who it was everybody in the lock had stopped moving and they all had fixed expressions on their faces all the girls were smiling prettily and all the men were trying to look brave and handsome then i saw the photographer and at once i understood i wondered if i would be in time our boat was the first one in the lock so i must look nice for the man s photograph so i turned round quickly and stood in the front of the boat i arranged my hair carefully and i tried to make myself look strong and interesting we stood and waited for the important moment when the man would actually take the photograph just then someone behind me called out hi look at your nose i could not turn round to see whose nose it was but i had a quick look at george s nose it seemed to be all right i tried to look at my own nose and that seemed to be all right too look at your nose you stupid fool the voice cried again more loudly this time and then another voice called push your nose out you two with the dog we could not turn round because the man was just going to take the photograph was it us they were calling to what was the matter with our noses why did they want us to push them out but now everybody in the lock started shouting and a very loud deep voice from the back called look at your boat you in the red and black caps if you don t do something quickly there ll be two dead bodies in that photograph we looked then and we saw that the nose of our boat was caught in the wooden gate at the front of the lock the water was rising and our boat was beginning to turn over quickly we pushed hard against the side of the lock to move the boat the boat did move and george and i fell over on our backs we did not come out well in that photograph because the man took it just as we fell over we had expressions of where am i and what s happened on our faces and we were waving our feet about wildly in fact our feet nearly filled the photograph you could not see much else nobody bought the photographs they said they did not want photographs of our feet the photographer was not very pleased we passed wallingford and dorchester and we spent the night at clifton hampden which is a very pretty little village the next morning we were up early because we wanted to be in oxford by the afternonn by half past eight we had fin ished breakfast and we were through clifton lock at half past twelve we went through iffley lock from there to oxford is the most difficult part of the river first the river carries you to the right then to the left then it takes you out into the middle and turns you round three times we got in the way of a lot of other boats a lot of other boats got in our way and a lot of bad words were used however at oxford we had two good days there are a lot of dogs in the town montmorency had eleven fights on the first day and fourteen on the second this made him very happy if you are thinking of taking a trip on the river and you are going to start from oxford take your own boat unless you can take someone else s without being discovered the boats that you can hire on the thames above marlow are all right they do not let too much water in and they have seats and things but they are not really boats which you want people to see the person who hires one of these boats is the kind of person who likes to stay under the trees he likes to travel early in the morning or late at night when there are not many people about to look at him when he sees someone he knows he gets out of the boat and hides behind a tree i remember that some friends and i hired one of these boats one summer we had written to ask for a boat and when we arrived at the boathouse we gave our names the man said oh yes and then he called out to another man jim fetch the queen of the thames five minutes later jim came back with a very old piece of wood he had clearly just dug it up from a hole in the ground when he dug it up he had damaged it very badly we asked jim what it was it s the queen of the thames he answered we laughed at this and then one of us said all right now go and fetch the real boat they said that this was the real boat chapter the journey home we left oxford on the third day to go back home the weather changed and when we left oxford it was raining it continued to rain not heavily but all the time when the sun is shining the river turns everything into a golden dream but when it rains the river is brown and miser able it rained all day and at first we pretended we were enjoy ing it we said that it was a nice change we added that it was good to see the river in all kinds of weather harris and i sang a song about how good it was to be free and to be able to enjoy the sun and the rain george thought it was much more serious and he put up the umbrella before lunch he put the cover on the boat and it stayed there all afternoon we just left a little hole so that we could see out we stopped for the night just before day s lock and i cannot say that we spent a happy evening the rain came down without stopping everything in the boat was wet supper was not a success we were all tired of cold meat and we talked about our favourite foods when we passed the cold meat to montmorency he refused our offer he went and sat at the other end of the boat alone we played cards after supper we played for about an hour and a half and george won ten pence harris and i lost five pence each we decided to stop then because the game was getting too exciting after that we had some whisky and we sat and talked george told us about a man he had known this man had slept on the river in a wet boat like ours and it had made him very ill ten days later the poor man died in great pain george said he was quite a young man so it was very sad then harris remembered one of his friends who had camped out on a wet night when he woke up the next morning he was in great pain and he was never able to walk again so then of course we began to talk about other illnesses harris said it would be very serious if one of us became ill be cause we were a long way from a doctor after this we really needed something to make us feel a bit happier so george sang to us that really made us cry after that we could think of nothing else to do so we went to bed well we undressed and we lay down in the boat we tried to go to sleep but it was four hours before we did so at five o clock we all woke up again so we got up and had break fast the second day was the same as the first it rained all day we sat in our raincoats under the cover and we travelled slow ly along the river i did try to sing again but it was not a suc cess however we all agreed that we should continue our trip we had come to enjoy ourselves for a fortnight on the river and we were going to finish the trip if it killed us well that would be a sad thing for our friends and families but we would not give in to the weather it s only two more days harris said and we are young and strong perhaps we ll be all right at about four o clock we began to discuss our plans for that evening we were a little past goring then and we decided to go on to pangbourne and spend the night there another happy evening george said we sat and thought about it we would be in pangbourne by five o clock we would finish our dinner by half past six after that we could walk about the village in the rain or we could sit in a dark little pub it would be more interesting to go to the alhambra theatre in london harris said and he looked out at the sky with supper afterwards at that little french restaurant i added yes i m almost sorry we ve decided to stay on the boat harris said then we were silent for a time i know we ve decided to stay and die on this boat george said but there is a train which leaves pangbourne soon after five o clock we could be in london in time to get something to eat and afterwards we could go on to the theatre nobody said a word we looked at each other and we all felt badly about it we did not speak but we got out the bag we looked up the river and down the river there was nobody there twenty minutes later three figures and an ashamed dog qui etly left the nearest boathouse and went towards the station we had told the boatman a lie we had asked him to take care of the boat for us until nine o clock the next morning we said we would come back for it then however if only if something happened to stop us from coming back then we would write to him we reached paddington station at seven o clock and we drove straight to the restaurant we had a light meal and left montmorency there then we went to the theatre for some reason everybody stared at us and this made us very happy perhaps it was because of our interesting clothes or because we looked so healthy afterwards we went back to the restaurant where supper was waiting for us we really did enjoy that supper for ten days we had lived on cold meat and bread and not much else we ate and drank without speaking and then we sat back and rested we felt good and thoughtful and kind then harris who was sitting next to the window pulled back the curtain and looked out into the street it was still raining and it was dark and very wet one or two people hur ried past the rain was running from their umbrellas and the women were holding up their long skirts harris picked up his glass well he said we ve had a good trip and i m very grate ful to old father thames but i think we were right to give up and come back here s to three men well out of a boat and montmorency stood on his back legs in front of the window looked out into the night and gave a short bark to show that he agreed four sisters christmas won t be christmas without any presents said jo crossly it s so awful to be poor agreed meg looking at her old dress it s not right for some girls to have pretty things and others to have nothing at all said little amy we ve got father and mother and each other said beth gently the four young faces round the fire cheered up as they thought of this but then jo said sadly we haven t got father and we won t have him for a long time she didn t say perhaps never but each silently thought it remembering that he was away at the war in the south then meg said mother says we shouldn t spend money on presents when our men are fighting a war we can t expect anything from mother or each otehr said jo but we only have a dollar each and that won t help the army much let s each buy ourselves what we want and have a little fun we work hard to earn it i do teaching those awful children said meg what abut me said jo i m shut up all day working for a terrible old lady who gives me different orders every five seconds i think washing cups and plates and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world said beth my hands get too tired to play my music i have to go to school with girls who laugh at my dresses and say cruel things because my father isn t rich said amy i wish we had the money father lost when we were little jo said meg i wish i was a boy said jo then i could go and fight beside father meg was sixteen and very pretty with large eyes and soft brown hair and white hands fifteen year old jo was very tall and thin her long dark red hair was usually pushed up out of the way beth was thirteen a very shy girl who seemed to live in a happy world of her own amy was the youngest but thought herself to be the most important she had blue eyes and yellow hair which curled on to her shoulders at six o clock beth put a pair of slippers by the fire to warm and meg lit the lamp amy got out of the comfortable chair without bing asked and jo forgot how tired she was and held the slippers closer to the fire these are old she said mother needs a new pair i ll get her some with my dollar said beth no i shall cried amy i m the oldest began meg i m the man of the family now father is away and i shall buy tnem said jo let s each get her something and not get anything for ourselves said beth that s a kind idea said jo what shall we get everyone thought for a moment then meg said i ll give her a nice pair of gloves the best army slippers said jo some handkerchiefs said beth a little bottle of perfume said amy it won t cost much so i ll have some money left to buy something for me we ll let mother think we re getting things for ourselves and then surprise her said jo mrs march arrived home soon after she took off her wet things and put on her warm slippers meg made the tea jo brought wood for the fire beth was quiet and busy and amy gave orders i ve got a letter from father cried mrs march it was a letter to cheer them up and the special message for the girls came at the end give them all my love and a kiss i think of them every day i know they will be loving childrento you and that when i come back i will be prouder than ever of my little women a tear dropped off the end of jo s nose amy hid her face on her momer s shoulder i m selfish she cried but i ll try to be better we all will cried meg i think too much about the way i look and hate to work but i won t any more and i ll try to be a little woman said jo and not be rough and wild beth said nothing but she began to work hard at a blue army glove she was making so the four girls decided that they would all try very hard to be good they would never be cross or lazy or selfish and they would all help each other they talked over their plan that evening while they made sheets for aunt march then at nine o clock they stopped to sing a song beth played the old piano and meg and her mother led the singing jo always sang in the wrong place but the girls never got too old to sing together a happy christmas jo was the first to wake up on christmas morning but soon they were all awake and they went downstairs where s mother asked meg i don t know said old hannah she had lived with the family since meg was born and was more like a friend than a servant some poor woman came to the door and your mother went off to see what was needed she ll be back soon said meg she looked at the presents for her mother which were in a basket under a chair ready to bring out at the right time where is amy s bottle of perfume she went to put some pretty paper round it i think said jo suddenly they heard the outside door close here s mother hide the basket quick said jo but it was amy she came in quickly where have you been and what s that behind you asked meg i ran to the shop and changed the little bottle of perfume for a big one said amy i spent all my money to get it and i m not going to be selfish any more meg smiled proudly and put her arms around her sister then there was another bang from the outside door and the basket was pushed back under the chair the girls ran to the table ready for their breakfast happy christmas mother they shouted happy christmas little daughters said mrs march then the smile disappeared from her face girls listen not far away is a poor woman mrs hummel with a new baby her six children are in one bed trying to keep warm as they have no wood for a fire there is nothing to eat and they are hungry and cold will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present for a minute no one spoke then jo said mother i m so glad you came back before we began to eat and the girls quickly began to put their breakfast in a basket i knew you would do it said mrs march smiling she took the girls and hannah to a cold miserable little room in an old building where they found a sick mother a crying baby and a group of children with white frightened faces the children were on the bed under a blanket trying to keep warm the woman almost cried with happiness when she saw the girls hannah who had brought wood made a fire mrs march gave the mother tea and hot food then she dressed the little baby gently the girls put the children round the fire and fed them like hungry birds it was a very happy meal although the girls ate none of it but no one was happier than those hungry young ladies who gave away their breakfast on christmas morning mrs march was surprised and pleased when she saw her presents later there was a lot of laughing and kissing and explaining then for the rest of the day the girls were busy jo liked to write plays and the four of them were going to act one that evening they had learned their words and had worked hard to make strange and wonderful clothes for all the different characters in the play on christmas night some other girls came to watch at first there was a lot of whispering and laughing from the four sisters behind the curtains then the curtains were opened and the play began it was an exciting story about hugo acted by jo wearing a black beard beautiful zara and brave roderigo there were also two ghosts a cruel king and a tall castle made of paper and wool which unfortunately fell down just as roderigo and zara were escaping from it there were screams of laughter from everyone but the actors picked the mselves up and carried on through more dangers and mysteries until the happy ending was reached all the visitors loved the play and after the excitement and fun came a surprise for everyone would the young ladles like to stay for supper asked hannah and when the girls saw the supper table they could not believe their eyes there was ice cream cake fruit and french chocolate and in the middle of the table were flowers for each of the four actors where did it all come from asked amy from father christmas perhaps said beth mother did it said meg aunt march sent it said jo you re all wrong laughed mrs march old mr laurence sent it the laurence boy s grandfather said meg but we don t know him hannah told his servant about your breakfast party and that pleased him said mrs march he knew my faher many years ago and he sent me a note this afternoon asking if he could send my cbildren a few small christmas presents the idea came from that boy i know it did said jo i m sure he wants to know us but he s shy and meg won t let me speak to him when we pass him in the street she says that it s not at all polite for young ladies to introduce themselves to strangers you mean the people who live in the big house next door don t you said one of the other girls my mother knows old mr laurence she says he keeps his grandson in the house when the boy isn t riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited the boy to our party but he didn t come that boy needs to have some fun said jo the laurence boy look said meg excitedly a day or two later she waved a piece of paper at jo an invitation to a new year s party at sallie gardiner s house and it s for both of us mother says we can go but what shall we wear our best cotton dresses said jo because we haven t got anything else yours is as good as new but mine has a burn and a hole in the back then you must keep your back out of sight said meg i ll have a new ribbon for my hair and my new slippers and my gloves are all right mine are stained soi ll have to go without you must wear gloves to a dance jo cried meg then we ll each wear one good one and carry a bad one said jo meg looked worried all right but you will behave nicely won t you don t stare or put your hands behind your back on new year s eve the two younger sisters watched the two older girls get ready for the party there was a lot of running up and down and laughing and talking meg wanted some curls around her face so jo began to work on the papered ends of meg s hair with a pair of hot tongs should they smoke like that asked beth it s the wetness drying said jo what a strange burning smell said amy i ll take the papers off now said jo and you ll see lots of little curls she took the papers off and to her horror the burnt hair came off with them oh oh what have you done to my hair cried meg i always get things wrong said jo unhappily i m so sorry i suppose the tongs were too hot don t worry amy told meg who was crying just tie your ribbon so that the ends come on to your forehead a little and it will look quite fashionable at last meg and jo were ready and went off to the gardiners house where mrs gardiner welcomed them kindly meg immediately began to enjoy herself with sallie but jo wasn t interested in girlish talk and stood with her back carefully against wall watching the dancing soon meg was asked to dance then jo saw a big red haired boy coming towards her and she quickly went through a door into a small room unfortunately another shy person was already hiding there and she found herself looking at the laurence boy oh dear i didn t know any one was here jo said the boy laughed don t go i came in here because i don t know any people but i think i ve seen you before he said you live near us don t you next door said jo we enjoyed your nice christmas present my grandfather sent it miss march but you gave your grandfather the idea didn t you mr laurence i m not mr laurence only laurie he said and i m not miss

winter can you speak french she asked he said something in french and jo listened carefully you asked who is the young lady in the pretty slippers it s my sister meg and you knew it was do you think she s pretty yes he said she looks so fresh and quiet this pleased jo very much and soon the two of them were talking easily like old friends i hear you re always studying hard said jo are you going to college soon not for a year or two he said i m sixteen next month and i won t go before i m seventeen i wish i was going to college said jo i hate even the idea of it said laurie jo wanted to know

habit of standing near a fire and i burn my dresses said jo i have to keep still so that no one will see the burn on this one laugh if you like but laurie didn t laugh never mind that he said gently please come jo smiled all right she said thank you when the music stopped they sat down and began to talk but jo saw meg waving at her she went over and followed her sister into a side room i ve turned my foot over and hurt my ankle said meg i can t walk on it and i don t know how i m going to get home i m not surprised you turned your foot over in those stupid high shoes said jo you ll have to get a carriage or stay here all night a carriage will cost a lot said meg and i can t stay here for the night because the house is full i ll just rest until hannah comes to fetch us then do the best i can they re going in for supper now said jo i ll stay with you no run and bring me some coffee said meg jo found the coffee but immediately dropped some down the front of her dress she was cleaning it off with meg s glove when a friendly voice spoke to her gan i help said laurie he had a cup of coffee in one hand and a plate with a cake on it in the other i was trying to get something for meg said jo and i was looking for someone to give this to he said he fetched more coffee and a cake for jo then the three of them had a happy time talking together until hannah arrived meg completely forgot about her foot and stood up quickly she cried out with pain and when laurle saw that she could not walk he immediately offered to take them home in his grandfather s carriage but you can t want to go home yet said jo i always go early said laurie he sat with the driver and the two girls sat with hannah inside the carriage and talked excitedly about the party i had a wonderful time did you said jo yes until i hurt myself said meg salie s friend annie moffat has asked me to go and stay with her for a week in the spring when sallie does jo told meg her adventures and then they were home they thanked laurie and went quietly into the house hoping to wake no one but as soon as they opened their bedroom door two little voices cried out tell us about the party tell us about the party the house next door it s so nice to go to parties and drive home in carriages said mea the next morning other people live like that all the time and i wish we could i wish we were rich well we re not said jo so we must do our work with a smile the way mother does mr march had lost most of his money helping a friend when the two older girls discovered this they wanted to do something to earn some money for the family and as soon as they were old enough they found work meg got a job teach ing four small children it was hard for her to be poor because she could remember the time when their home had been beautiful with every thing they wanted and every day at mrs king s house she saw pretty dresses and heard talk of parties and the theatre all the things which meg loved jo went to aunt march who needed someone to fetch and carry things and read to her she was a difficult old lady who complained a lot but jo did her best beth was much too shy to go to school with other children so she studied at home with her father when he went away and her mother was busy with war work beth continued to study by herself and helped hannah keep the home tidy for the others she also spent long quiet hours alone talking to her dolls or playing the old piano beth loved music and although the family could not afford music lessons or a good piano for her she tried hard to make herself a better musician amy drew the most beautiful pictures and wanted to be a fa mous painter one day she was a favoturite with everyone except when she complained abut having to wear her cousin s old clothes because her mother could not afford to buy new ones for her one afternoon a week or two later jo went outside to clear the snow away from some of the garden so that beth could walk there when the sun came out she looked across to the house next door a big stone house with lovely things inside that jo occasionally saw through the open curtains at the windows but it seemed a lonely lifeless kind of house as no children played outside no motherly face smiled at the windows and not many people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson she had not seen the laurence boy lately and wondered if he was away but suddenly she saw him looking out of an upstairs window she threw up a handful of soft show and called out are you ill laurie opened the window m almost better thank you he said i ve had a bad cold what do you find to do said jo nothing he said they won t let me why don t you get someone to come and see you i don t know anyone you know us said jo so i do laughed laurie will you come please i ll come if mother will let me i ll go and ask her shut the window and wait until i come laurie was excited and began to get ready for jo s visit he brushed his hair and tried to make his room tidy soon after he heard voices downstairs then a surprised servant ran up to his room there s a young lady to see you sir she said a moment later jo appeared with a box in one hand and beth s three small cats in the other mother sends her love she said meg asked me to bring some of her cake and beth thought you would like to play with her cats isn t she funny laurie laughed how kind you all are he said shall i read to you sald jo i d rather talk he said i can talk all day said jo smiling beth says i never know when to stop is beth the one who stays at home yes that s beth she s a good girl the pretty one is meg and the curly haired one is amy is that right he said yes how did you know laurie s face became red i hear you calling to each other and you always seem to be having so much fun sometimes in the evenings you forget to close your curtains and i can see you sitting round the fire with your mother i haven t got a mother jo saw the sadness in his eyes why don t you come over and see us would your grandfather let you perhaps if your mother asked him said laurie he spends a lot of time among his books and mr brooke my tutor doesn t live here so i haven t anyone to go out with do you like your school i don t go to school i go out to work to my aunt s said jo she described the difficult old lady and made him laugh with her stories she told him all about her sisters the plays they acted and their hopes and fears for their father then they talked about books and jo discovered that laurie loved them as much as she did come and see our library he said grandfather is out so you needn t be afraid i m not afraid of anything replied jo he took her down to a room where the walls were covered with books and pictures you should be the happiest boy in the world said jo sitting in a big armchair and looking round a person can t live on books he said suddenly a bell rang jo jumped up out of the chair it s your grand father she said what if it is said laurie with a smile you re not afraid of anything remember perhaps i am a little bit afraid of him said jo the servant came in at that moment the doctor is here to see you sir she said to laurie can i leave you for a minute or two jo he said yes i m very happy here said jo he went away and jo was staring at a large picture of the old gentleman when the door opened again without turning she said i won t be afraid of him because he s got kind eyes although his mouth looks hard and cold he s not as handsome as my grandfather but i like him thank you said a deep voice behind her she turned quickly and saw old mr laurence jo s face turned a bright red and she wanted to run away but the old man s eyes looked kinder than those in the picture and seemed to have a smile in them so you re not afraid of me eh he said not much sir but i m not as handsome as your grandfather not quite sir but you like me he laughed and shook hands with her now what have you been doing with my grandson trying to cheer him up sir said jo he seems a bit lonely then come and have some tea with us laurie was very surprised to see jo with his grandfather but was soon talking and laughing happily with jo the old man watched the two young people and noticed the change in his grandson she s right he thought the boy does need cheering up after tea they went into a room where there was a large and beautiful piano do you play jo asked laurie sometimes he answered play now i want to hear it so i can tell beth so laurie played and jo listened afterwards mr laurence said he plays quite well but i want him to do well in more important things now i hope you ll come again he shook hands with her goodnight jo laurie walked to the door with her he doesn t like to hear me play he said why not said jo i ll tell you one day he said when jo told the family of her afternoon s adventures they all wanted to go and visit the big house mother why doesn t mr laurence like to hear laurie play the piano asked jo laurie s father married an italian lady a musician said mrs march the old man didn t like her and never saw his son after they were married laurie was born in italy but his parents died when he was a child and his grandfather brought him home laurie loves music and i expect his grand father is afraid he ll want to be a musician like his mother laurie should be a musician if he wants to be said jo sending him to college will just make him unhappy a surprise for beth laurie and the four girls were soon great friends mr brooke complained to the old gentleman that his student was always running across to see the marches let him have a bit of a holiday said mr laurence he can catch up with his studies later what good times they had writing and acting plays happy evenings at the marches and little parties at the big house only beth was too shy to go there when mr laurence heard about beth s shyness he came to have tea with their mother one day and began to talk about music and great singers he had heard beth found it impossible to stay in her corner and came to listen laurie hasn t much time for his music mr laurence told mrs march so the piano is not used very often would any of your girls like to play it sometimes they needn t see or speak to anyone and i ll be in my study he got up to go but if they don t want to come at this moment a little hand touched his own it was beth s i i want to come she said her voice shaking very much you re the musical girl said mr laurence gently i m beth yes i love music and i shall come the next day beth waited until the old and the young gentlemen both went out then she ran across to the big house and found her way to the room with the beautiful piano as soon as she began to play she forgot her fears immediately in the delight which the music gave her after that beth went every day she never knew that mr laurence often opened his study door to hear her playing or that laurie stood in the hall to keep the servants away from the shy little girl but she was so grateful that she asked her mother and sisters to help her make the old gentleman a pair of slippers after several days careful sewing the slippers were finished then beth wrote a short letter and with laurie s help left it with the slippers in the old man s study one morning before he was up the next day beth went out for a walk and when she came back the others were waiting for her here s a letter for you beth they called out come and read it she hurried to the house and they took her into the front room look there everyone was saying at once beth looked and got the biggest surprise of her life for there stood a lovely little piano with a letter on the top of it addressed to miss elizabeth march you you read it jo whispered beth i can t so jo opened the letter and began to read dear miss march she read i have had many pairs of slippers but none which have pleased me so much as yours i should like to thank pou for your kindness by sending you something that once belonged to my little granddaughter who died with many thanks i am your good friend james laurence jo put an arm around her sister now try it beth she said beth sat down and began to play and everyone thought it was the most perfect piano they had ever heard you ll have to go and thank him said jo with a smik knowing that beth was much too shy to do anything like that but beth surprised them all i ll do it at once she said bravely and away she walked through the garden and into the big house next door she went up to the old gentleman s study and knocked on the door come in said mr laurence beth went in i came to say thank you sir she began in her quiet little voice but he looked so friendly that she ran and put both her arms around his neck and kissed him the old gentleman was so surprised that he nearly fell off his chair but he was very pleased indeed by that shy little kiss and soon the two of them were talking like old friends later he walked home with beth the girls watching with great interest from the window could not believe their eyes well meg said i do believe the world is coming to an end amy in trouble where are you going amy asked meg and jo one afternoon i want to come too you can t dear you re not invited said meg you re going somewhere with laurle i know you are yes we are said jo now stop annoying us you re going to the theatre amy said suddenly i want to go with you we could take her i suppose began meg no laurie only invited us said jo i shall go shouted amy meg says i can you just stay where you are said jo angrily i ll make you sorry fof this jo march amy shouted as meg and jo left the house the two older sisters enjoyed themselves at the theatre but jo couldn t stop worrying as she wondered what amy would do to make her sorry she found out the next afternoon beth amy and meg were sitting together when jo ran into the room has anyone taken my notebook jo asked meg and beth said no at once but amy said nothing amy you ve got it said jo no i haven t said amy that s a lie said jo tell me the truth or i ll make you do what you like said amy you ll never see your stupid book again because i burned it jo s face went white what but i worked so hard writing my stories i said i d make you sorry and i have said amy jo jumped at amy and shook her shoulders you wicked wicked girl cried jo i ll never ever forgive you and she ran out of the room mrs march came home and heard the story oh how could you do that amy she said that was jo s book of stories she wrote them all herself and was hoping to make them good enough to print slowly amy began to understand the terrible thing she had done and started to cry later when jo appeared for tea amy begged her sister to forgive her i shall never forgive you jo answered it was not a happy evening and when singing time came jo remained silent afterwards she kissed her mother and said goodnight my dear don t go to bed feeling so angry with your sister whispered mrs march i m sorry mother i can t for give her replied jo next day jo wanted to get out of the house so she picked up her skates and went next door to ask laurie to tske her skating amy heard them going jo promised to take me with her next time she complained it s hard for her to forgive you amy said meg go after them and wait until jo is enjoying herself then give her a kiss or do something kind it was not far to the river but jo and laurie were already skating when amy arrived jo saw amy but turned away laurie was carefully skating along the edge of the ice and didn t see the younger girl amy put her skates on and stood on the ice keep near the edge the ice isn t safe in the middle laurie called to jo then he disappeared round the first bend in the river jo heard but amy did not jo realized that amy probably hadn t heard but she said nothing and skated after laurie let amy look after herself jo thought amy skated out towards the smoother ice in the middle of the river jo reached the bend and for a moment she stood still a strange feeling in her heart something made her turn round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go crashing through the ice into the cold water amy gave a cry that make jo s heart stop with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone and for a second she could only stand and stare at the little blue hood of amy s coat above the black water suddenly laurie skated past her and shouted bring a piece of wood from the side of the river quickly wild with fear jo fetched some wood and pulled it across the ice while laurie held amy s head above the water together they got her out she was more frightened than hurt and was quickly taken home they covered her in blankets and tried to calm her and after a little while she fell asleep in front of the warm fire later when everything was quiet jo asked her mother are you sure she s safe quite safe dear it was sensible to get her home as quickly as you did laurie did it all said jo mother if she should die it will be my fault i get angry so quickly oh why can t i be more like you i get angry nearly every day of my life jo said mrs march but i ve learned not to show it i ve learned to stop myself saying the angry words that come to my lips and you must try to do the same my dear amy moved in her sleep and jo looked at her i refused to forgive her and today she nearly died and it was laurie who saved her how could i be so wicked jo began to cry then amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to jo s heart neither of them said a word but they held each other close and everything was forgiven and forgotten meg hears some gossip annie moffat did not forget her promised invitation and one april day meg went to stay at the moffats large house meg thought it was wonderful she loved riding in fine carriages wearing her best dress every day and doing nothing except enjoy herself she soon began to talk about fashionable clothes and hairstyles in the way that the other girls did and the more meg saw of annie s pretty things the more she wished that she too was rich annie s older sisters belle and clara were fine young ladies mr moffat was a fat friendly gentleman and mrs moffat was a fat friendly lady they were all very kind to meg and did their best to make her feel at home when the evening for a small party came meg s best dress looked very old next to sallie s new one but no one said anything about it the girls were getting ready when a servant brought in a box of flowers for miss march she said and here s a letter what fun who are they from said the girls we didn t know you had a young man the letter is from mother and the flowers are from laurie said meg simply oh said annie with a strange look her mother s loving words and laurie s kindness made meg feel much happier and she enjoyed the party very much annie made her sing and someone said that meg had a fine voice so meg was having a nice time until she heard some one say on the other side of a large table of flowers how old is the laurence boy sixteen or seventeen i think said another voice it would be an excellent thing for one of those girls said a third voice sallie says they are very friendly and the old man thinks they are all wonderful i expect mrs m has made her plans said mrs moffat s voice but do you think the girl knows of them she told that little lie about her mother and her cheeks went pink i m sure the note was from the boy really poor thing she d be very pretty if she had some nice clothes do you think she ll mind if we offer to lend her a dress for thursday i shall ask young laurence to come and we ll have some fun with her afterwards meg tried to forget what she d heard but could not the gossip made her angry and she was glad when the party was over and she was alone in her bed she cried quietly to herself why did people have to say those things she and laurie were just friends but now that friendship felt damaged by the unkind gossip the next day miss belle said meg dear we ve sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday meg pretended to misunderstand you re very kind but i m afraid he won t come he s nearly seventy miss belle laughed i mean the young man there isn t one said meg laurie is only a boy isn t he about your age said clara nearer jo s said meg i m seventeen in august it s nice of him to send you flowers said annie he often does to all of us said meg my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know what will you wear on thursday asked sallie my white dress again i haven t got any others no others said sallie how funny i have a pretty blue dress i can t wear any more meg said belle it will please me if you wear it you re very kind but began meg please do said belle you ll look quite beautiful in it meg couldn t refuse this kind offer and on the thursday evening belle helped to change meg into a fine lady she brushed and curled her hair reddened her lips then helped her to get into the sky blue dress the neck of the dress was cut very low and meg was quite shocked when she saw herself in the mirror a necklace and earrings were added and meg was ready for the party at first she felt strange in all the fine clothes but she soon discovered that people who did not usually notice her now came to speak to her several young men who had only stared before now asked to be introduced suddenly meg saw laurie across the room he was staring at her and he didn t look very pleased meg began to feel uncomfortable and she wished that she had worn her old dress as she walked up to laurie she saw belle and annie watching them both and smiling i m glad you came meg said to laurie in her most grown up voice i was afraid you wouldn t jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked said laurie what will you tell her ll say i didn t know you because you look so unlike yourself i m quite afraid of you he said the girls dressed me up for fun said meg don t you like it no i don t came the cool reply meg became angry then i shan t stay with you and she walked off towards the window a moment or two later an older man went past her and she heard him say to his friend that girl has been dressed up like a doll oh dear thought meg why didn t i wear my own things she turned and saw laurie behind her please forgive me he said come and have something to eat meg tried to look annoyed please come he said again i don t like your dress but i do think you are wonderful meg smiled and found it impossible to stay angry with him please don t tell them at home about my dress she said they won t understand that it was just for fun and it will worry mother i was stupid to wear it but i ll tell them myself i won t say anything he promised he did not see her again until supper time when she was drinking wine with two other boys you ll feel ill tomorrow if you drink much of that meg laurie whispered to her i m not meg tonight she said i m a doll who does crazy things tomorrow i ll be good again meg danced and laughed and talked to as many young men as she could manage but went to bed feeling that she hadn t enjoyed herself as much as she had expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite tired of her fortnight s fun i m glad to be home she said to her mother and jo after telling them how she was dressed up like a doll drank too much wine and was ill afterwards she had laughed while telling them the story but her face still looked worried at the end there is something else i think said mrs march smoothing meg s cheek which suddenly became rose red yes meg said slowly i hate people saying and thinking awful things about us and laurie then she told them the gossip she had heard what rubbish said jo just wait until i see annie moffat how stupid to think that mother has plans and that we are kind to laurie because he is rich and may marry one of us one day he ll laugh when i tell him no jo said her mother you must never repeat wicked gossip do you have plans mother asked meg all mothers do dear said mrs march but my plans are different from mrs moffat s i suspect i want my daughters to be loved and i want people to think well of them i want them to marry well but not to marry rich men just because they are rich i d rather you were poor men s wives if that meant you had happy peaceful lives but your father and i believe that we ll always be proud of our daughters whether they are married or single you will you will said meg and jo together all play and no work the first of june and the king family is going on holiday tomorrow said meg i m free for three months and aunt march went away for her holiday today said jo isn t life wonderful what will you do all your holiday asked amy i ll stay in bed late and do nothing said meg i have lots of books to read said jo let s not do any studying beth said amy let s play all the time and rest as jo and meg are going to do i will if mother doesn t mind said beth mrs march agreed to the plan and said they could try it for a week but she added i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play next day meg appeared at ten o clock and ate breakfast alone it was a lonely meal and the room was untidy because beth had not cleaned it jo went to the river with laurie then sat in the apple tree and read a book beth began to tidy things in her cupboard but she got tired and left it half done she went to her piano glad that she did not have to wash the cups and plates amy sat in the garden to draw hoping someone would see her and say something nice about her picture but no one appeared so she went for a walk got caught in the rain and came home very wet at tea everyone said that it had been a delightful but unusually long day meg who had been shopping in the afternoon now decided that she did not like the dress she had bought jo had a headache from reading too long beth couldn t find anything in her cupboard and the rain had made amy s dress so wet that she couldn t wear it to katy brown s party the next day mrs march listened smiled and said nothing the week seemed to get longer and longer with nothing much to do and by friday the girls were glad that it was nearly over then mrs march gave hannah a holiday and when the girls got up on saturday there was no breakfast ready no fire in the kitchen and no mother waiting for them what has happened said jo meg ran upstairs then came down to say that mother was staying in her room to have a rest she says we must look after ourselves today meg said good i want something to do said jo secretly they were all pleased to have something useful to do again beth and amy put cups and plates on the table while jo and meg got the breakfast then meg took some tea and an egg up to mrs march the tea was too strong and the egg wasburned mrs march did not complain but she laughed to herself afterwards jo decided to invite laurie to dinner there s meat and vegetables and plenty of potatoes she told meg and we can have strawberries and then coffee her mother said she did not mind at all because she was going out for dinner jo did her best but the potatoes were still hard in the middle the vegetables were cooked too long and fell to pieces and the meat was burned black the strawberries were not ready for eating and she put salt on them instead of sugar unfortunately this was not discovered until laurie began eating them he pretended everything was all right but amy took a spoonful and ran from the table what s wrong said jo meg and laurie told her oh no said jo then she saw laurie start to smile and she began to laugh soon everyone was laughing with her what a terrible day said jo after they had cleared everything away mrs march returned home later have you enjoyed your week of all play and no work girls or do you want another week of it she said i don t said jo nor do i shouted the others mother did you go out and leave us just to see how we would manage asked meg yes said mrs march i wanted you to see that being comfortable depends on us all helping each other and not just thinking of ourselves isn t it better to have time for play and time for work and to make each day useful and enjoyable oh it is mother it is said the girls some days later all four girls went on a picnic with laurie and his tutor mr brooke and some other young people sallie gardiner and her english friend miss kate vaughn were among them it was a sunny day and they had their picnic on a hill under some trees after the meal most of the young ladies and gentlemen played games but miss kate sat under a tree and began to draw meg watched while mr brooke lay on the grass beside her with a book which he did not read i wish i could draw said meg why don t you learn replied miss kate she was a little older than the other girls and was very much the fashionable young lady i haven t time said meg i have a job teaching four children in a family oh said miss kate looking rather shocked she said no more but her face showed that she thought being a private teacher was little better than being a servant and meg s cheeks quickly became red in america young ladies prefer to work and earn money for themselves said mr brooke quickly and not expect others to pay for everything i see said miss kate coldly soon after she took her drawing and moved away there s no place like america for us workers miss meg said mr brooke smiling his brown eyes looked at meg warmly and she smiled back at him i wish i liked teaching as much as you do she said you would if you were teaching laurie said mr brooke i ll be sorry when he goes to college next year but then i shall become a soldier i think every young man wants to be a soldier said meg but it s hard for the family who stay at home i have no family and not many friends to care if i live or die said mr brooke sadly laurie and his grandfather would care said meg and we would all be very sorry if anything happened to you thank you said mr brooke cheering up immediately secrets one october afternoon jo caught a bus into the town and stopped outside a building in one of the busy streets she went in looked up the stairs and after a minute ran out again she did this several times to the great amusement of a young man who was watching from the opposite side of the road but the fourth time jo gave herself a shake and walked up the stairs the young man crossed the road and waited it was laurie ten minutes later jo came running out but did not look pleased to see him what are you doing here she said i m waiting to walk home with you he said i ve a secret to tell you but first you must tell me yours you won t say anything at home will you said jo not a word promised laurie i ve left two of my stories with a newspaper man said jo but i ll have to wait until next week before i know if they will be printed miss march the famous american writer said laurie throwing his hat into the air and catching it jo looked pleased now what s your secret you remember meg lost a glove at the picnic said laurie well i know where it is is that all said jo looking disappointed wait until i tell you where it is he said tell me then said jo laurie whispered three words in jo s ear she stared at him looking both surprised and displeased how do you know i saw it where asked jo pocket what s wrong don t you like it of course not it s stupid what would meg say if she knew you mustn t tell anyone said laurie i didn t promise jo reminded him i thought you would be pleased he said pleased at the idea of someone coming to take meg away said jo no thank you she ran off down the hill but laurie came after her and reached the bottom first she came up behind him her face red and her hair blowing in the wind that was fun she said forgetting her crossness in the enjoyment of a good run at that moment someone passed by then stopped and looked back it was meg what are you doing here she said when she saw jo you ve been running haven t you jo when will you start to behave like a young lady don t make me grow up yet meg said jo looking sad it s hard enough having you change so suddenly meg was growing into a woman and laurie s secret made jo realize that meg would leave home one day perhaps soon two saturdays after jo had gone secretly into town meg saw laurie chasing jo all over the garden before the two of them fell on the grass laughing and waving a newspaper what can we do with that girl said meg she never will behave like a young lady minutes later jo came in with the newspaper she sat down and began to read it are you reading anything interesting asked meg only a story said jo read it aloud said amy it may amuse us jo began to read very fast and the girls listened it was a love story about two people called viola and angelo and most of the characters died in the end but the girls enjoyed it and meg even cried a little at the sad parts who wrote it asked beth watching jo s face jo put down the newspaper i did she said her eyes bright and shining you said meg surprised it s very good said amy i knew it said beth she ran across and put her arms around her sister oh jo i am so proud and how proud mrs march was when she was told everyone began to speak at the same time tell us all about it how much did you get for it what will father say won t laurie laugh so jo told them all about it and that evening there was no happier or prouder family that the marches a telegram mrs march the girls and laurie were sitting together on a dull november afternoon when hannah hurried into the room with a telegram mrs march read it then dropped it to the floor her face white and her hands shaking jo picked up the telegram and read it to the others in a frightened voice mrs march your husband is very ill come at once s hale blank hospital washington the girls moved close to their mother all their happiness had disappeared in a moment i shall go at once said mrs march but it may be too late oh my children for several minutes there was only the sound of crying then hannah hurried away to get things ready for the long journey where s laurie mrs march asked here said the boy oh let me do something send a telegram and say that i ll come at once said mrs march the next train goes early in the morning now i must write a note to aunt march jo give me that pen and paper jo knew that the money for the journey must be borrowed from aunt march and she too wanted to do something anything to help her father laurie went off to take the note to aunt march and to send the telegram jo went to fetch some things from the shops and amy and meg helped their mother to get ready father will need good food and wine to help him get better and there won t be much at the hospital said mrs march beth go and ask mr laurence for a couple of bottles of wine i m not too proud to beg for father mr laurence came back with beth he offered to go with mrs march but she wouldn t let the old gentleman make the long tiring journey although he could see that she would like to have somebody with her he went away again saying i ll be back soon after meg saw mr brooke by the door i m very sorry to hear your news miss march he said gently mr laurence and i think it will be a good idea if i travel with your mother how kind you all are said meg it will be so good to know that there is someone to take care of mother thank you very much she put out her hand and smiled gratefully up into his warm brown eyes laurie came back with a letter and money from aunt march but jo did not return it was late afternoon when she came walking in and gave her mother some money that s to help make father comfortable and to bring him home she said twenty five dollars said mrs march my dear where did you get it jo took off her hat your hair your beautiful hair cried amy all jo s lovely thick long hair was cut short jo how could you cried meg my dear girl there was no need for this said mrs march she doesn t look like my jo but i love her dearly for doing it said beth and began to cry don t cry beth said jo i wanted to do something for father and selling my hair was the only thing i could think of doing i ll soon have a curly head again which will be short and easy to keep tidy but later when amy and beth were asleep and meg was lying awake she heard jo crying are you crying about father jo she asked no not now it s my hair cried jo i d do it again if i could but i did love my hair and the selfish bit of me is making me cry don t tell anyone i ll be all right in the morning during the days after their mother and mr brooke went away meg aud jo went back to their jobs and beth and amy helped hannah to keep the house tidy everyone tried very hard to be good and hard working and helpful news of their father came through at first telling them he was dangerously ill but then saying he was slowly getting better beth ten days after their mother went away beth came home late after one of several visits to a sick baby at the hummels house she went straight to her mother s room and shut herself inside half an hour later jo found her sitting there looking very ill beth what s the matter cried jo beth put out a hand to keep her away you ve had scarlet fever haven t you she said years ago when meg did said jo why oh jo mrs hummel s baby is dead said beth it died in my arms before mrs hummel got home my poor beth how awful for you said jo putting an arm around her sister what did you do i just sat and held it until mrs hummel came with the doctor he looked at heinrich and minna who were also feeling sick it s scarlet fever he said then he told me to come home and take some medicine quickly or i would catch it too i ll fetch hannah said jo don t let amy come said beth she hasn t had it and i don t want to give it to her it was decided that amy must go to aunt march s house so laurie took her there poor amy did not like this plan at all and only agreed to go when laurie said he would visit her every day to bring her news of beth when laurie got back he asked jo and meg if he ought to send a telegram to mrs march hannah says mother can t leave father and would only worry said meg she says beth won t be sick long and that she knows what to do but it doesn t seem right mr laurence was not allowed to see beth and meg felt unhappy writing letters to her mother saying nothing about beth s illness jo nursed beth night and day but the time came when beth did not know her and called for her mother jo was frightened and meg begged to be allowed to write the truth but hannah said there was no danger yet then a letter came saying that mr march was worse and could not think of coming home for a long time how dark the days seemed how sad and lonely the sisters worked and waited as the shadow of death lay over the once happy home it was then that meg realized how rich she had been in the things which really mattered love peace good health and jo watching her little sister thought about how unselfish beth always was living for others and trying to make home a happy place for all who came there amy sad and lonely at aunt march s house just wanted to come home so that she could do something to help beth on the first day of december the doctor came in the morning he looked at beth then said quietly if mrs march can leave her husband i think she should come home now jo threw on her coat and ran out into the snow to send a telegram when she arrived back laurie came with a letter saying that mr march was getting better again this was good news but jo s face was so unhappy that laurie asked what is it is beth worse i ve sent for mother said jo beginning to cry beth doesn t know us any more laurie held her hand and whispered i m here jo hold on to me your mother will be here soon and then everything will be all right i m glad father is better said jo now mother won t feel so bad about coming home you re very tired said laurie but i ll tell you something to cheer you up better than anything what is it said jo laurie smiled i sent a telegram to your mother yesterday and mr brooke answered that she d come at once she ll be here tonight and everything will be all right jo threw her arms around him oh laurie oh mother i am so glad she did not cry again but held on to her friend he was surprised but he smoothed her hair and followed this with a kiss or two jo pushed him gently away oh don t i didn t mean i enjoyed it laughed laurie then went on grandfather and i thought your mother ought to know she wouldn t forgive us if beth well if anything happened her train will be in at two o clock in the morning and i ll meet her all that day the snow fell and the hours went slowly by the doctor came then said he would come back after midnight when he expected there to be some change in beth s condition for better or worse hannah fell asleep in a chair beside beth s bed mr laurence waited downstairs while laurie lay on the floor pretending to rest the girls just waited unable to sleep at twelve o clock a change seemed to pass over beth s face hannah slept on but the girls saw the shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed an hour went by and laurie left quietly for the station at two o clock jo was standing at the window watching the snow she heard something and turned to see meg kneeling beside her mother s chair a cold feeling of fear passed over jo beth is dead she thought she ran to the bed the pain had gone from beth s face and now there was a look of peace instead jo kissed her and softly whispered goodbye beth goodbye hannah woke up and looked at beth the fever s gone she cried she s sleeping and breathing easily the doctor came soon after i think she ll be all right he said keep the house quiet and let her sleep meg and jo held each other close their hearts too full for words beth was lying as she used to with her cheek on her hand and breathing quietly i wish mother would come now whispered jo and a moment later they heard the sound of the door below a cry from hannah then laurie s happy voice saying girls she s come she s come love and mr brooke when beth woke from her long sleep she looked into her mother s face and smiled then she slept again but mrs march held on to her daughter s thin little hand hannah made breakfast while meg and jo listened as their mother told them about their father s health and mr brooke s promise to stay with him then meg and jo closed their tired eyes and were able to rest at last laurie went to give the good news to amy at aunt march s house he too was tired after the long night and just man aged to finish telling his story before he fell asleep in the chair amy began to write a short letter to her mother but before she could finish it she saw mrs march coming towards her aunt s house amy ran to meet her there were probably many happy little girls in the city that day but amy was the happiest of them all as she sat on her mother s knee i ve been thinking a lot about beth she said everyone loves her because she isn t selfish people wouldn t feel half so bad about me if i was sick but i d like to be loved and missed i m going to try and be like beth as much as i can her mother kissed her i m sure you will succeed she said now i must go back to beth be patient little daughter and we ll soon have you home again that evening while meg was writing to her father jo went upstairs to beth s room and found her mother beside the bed as the little girl slept i want to tell you something mother said jo is it about meg said mrs march how quickly you guessed said jo yes it s about her last summer meg lost one of her gloves at the laurences picnic and later laurie told me that mr brooke had it and kept it in his coat pocket it fell out once and laurie saw it mr brooke told laurie that he liked meg but was afraid to tell her because she was so young and he was so poor isn t it all awful do you think meg likes and cares about him asked mrs march with a worried look i don t know anything about love said jo do you think she s not in interested in john said mrs march who said jo staring mr brooke said her mother i call him john because we became good friends at the hospital oh dear said jo he s been good to father and nowyou ll let meg marry him if she wants to my dear don t be angry said mrs march john told us quite honestly that he loved meg but said he would earn enough money for a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he wants very much to make her love him if hecan he s an excellent young man but your father and i will not agree to meg marrying before she is twenty i want her to marry laurie and be rich said jo i m afraid laurie isn t grown up enough for meg said mrs march don t make plans jo let time and their own hearts bring your friends together meg came in with the letter for her father beautifully written my dear said her mother looking at the letter please add that i send my love to john do you call him john said meg smiling yes he s been like a son to us and we are very fond ofhim said mrs march watching her daughter closely i m glad of that because he s so lonely was meg s qui et answer goodnight mother dear mrs march kissed her gently she does not love john yet she thought but she will soon learn to laurie makes trouble and jo makes peace laurie quickly realized that jo was keeping a secret which she refused to tell him but he guessed the secret was about meg and mr brooke and was annoyed that his tutor had said nothing he began to make some private plans of his own meg meanwhile was busy getting things ready for her father s return but a change suddenly seemed to come over her for a day or two she jumped when she was spoken to and there was a worried look on her face then a letter arrived for her and a few minutes later mrs march and jo saw meg staring at it with a frightened face my child what is it said mrs march it s a mistake he didn t send it jo how could you do it meg hid her face in her hands and cried me i ve done nothing said jo what s she talking about meg pulled another letter from her pocket and threw it at jo you wrote it and that bad boy helped you how could you be so cruel and mean to us both jo and her mother read the letter which had been in meg s pocket my dearest meg i can no longer hide my love for you and must know your answer before i return i cannot tellyour parents yet but i think they will agree if they know that we love one another mr laurence will help me find a good job and then my sweet girl you will make me happy say nothing to your family yet but send a word of hope tome through laurie your loving john that terrible boy said jo i ll make him sorry but her mother said wait jo are you sure this is nothing to do with you i never saw the letter before said jo but mr brooke wouldn t write stupid things like that it s like his writing said meg unhappily looking at the second letter in her hand oh meg you didn t answer it said mrs march yes i did cried meg hiding her face again let me get that wicked boy shouted jo mrs march sat beside meg tell me everything laurie brought the first letter said meg he didn t seem to know anything about it i was going to tell you but i remembered how you liked mr brooke and thought it would be all right to keep my little secret for a while now i can never look him in the face again what did you write to him asked mrs march i only said that i was too young to do anything and that i didn t wish to have secrets from you so he must speak to father i thanked him for his kindness and said i would be his friend but nothing more for a long time mrs march smiled and looked pleased jo laughed what did he reply to that he writes here that he never sent any love letter and is sorry that my sister jo should play games with us like this said meg it s a very kind letter but imagine how awful i feel i don t believe brooke saw either of those letters said jo laurie wrote them both and he s keeping yours because i won t tell him my secret go and fetch laurie jo said mrs march i ll put a stop to all this at once away ran jo and mrs march gently told meg mr brooke s real feelings now dear do you love him enough to wait until he can make a home for you i m frightened and worried answered meg i don t want anything to do with love for a long time perhaps never if john doesn t know about all this don t tell him and please make jo and laurie keep quiet mrs march tried to calm her daughter but as soon as meg heard laurie coming back with jo she ran out of the room and mrs march saw the boy alone when laurie saw mrs march s angry face he guessed the reason jo waited outside the room as inside the voices rose and fell for half an hour but the girls never knew what was said when they were called in laurie apologized to meg and told her that mr brooke knew nothing about either of the two letters please forgive me meg he said i ll try said meg but i didn t think you could be so unkind laurie looked so sorry that jo wanted to forgive him straight away but she said nothing and refused even to look at him when he went away looking hurt and unhappy jo wished she had been more forgiving she could never stay angry for long so after a while she hurried over to the big house taking with her as an excuse one of mr laurence s books that she had borrowed is mr laurence in jo asked a servant yes miss but you can t see him said the servant why is he ill said jo no miss but he s been arguing with mr laurie where s laurie said jo he s shut in his room and he won t come out i ll go and see what s the matter said jo i m not afraid of either of them she went upstairs and knocked on laurie s door stop that shouted laurie jo immediately knocked again and the door flew open she stepped inside before laurie could stop her i ve come to say that i forgive you she said and i won t stay angry with you oh said laurie thank you what s wrong she said seeing his unhappy face i wouldn t tell grandfather why your mother wanted to see me because i promised her not to tell anyone he said but then grandfather tried to shake the truth out of me so i came up here and shut myself in i expect he s sorry he did that said jo go down and say you re sorry i ll help you no i won t said laurie angrily i was sorry about meg and i asked her to forgive me but i won t do it again when i m not the one who is wrong he ought to believe me when i say i can t tell him something i don t like being shaken like that and i won t go down until he apologizes listen if i get your grandfather to apologize for shaking you will you go down said jo yes but you won t do it answered laurie if i can manage the young one then i can manage the old one jo said to herself as she went downstairs come in said mr laurence when she knocked on his door it s me sir said jo i m returning a book do you want any more said the old man looking annoyed but trying not to show it yes please said jo and she pretended to look for an other book while mr laurence stared at her crossly what s that boy been doing he asked suddenly he won t tell me he did do something wrong and we forgave him said jo but we all promised not to say a word to anyone he must not hide behind a promise from you soft hearted girls said the old gentleman tell me jo i can t sir because mother has ordered me not to said jo and if i tell you it will make trouble for someone else not laurie this seemed to calm the old man then i ll forgive him he said after a moment he s a difficult boy and hard to manage you know so am i said jo but a kind word always helps you think i m not kind to him he said sharply too kind very often said jo a little afraid but just a bit quick to be angry with him sometimes the old gentleman looked a little ashamed you re right i am although i love the boy i find it hard to be patient with him sometimes bring him down and tell him it s all right i m sorry i shook him why not write him an apology sir said jo he says he won t come down until he s got one mr laurence gave her another sharp look but then smiled and put on his glasses here give me a bit of paper he said the words were written and jo kissed the old man s cheek then she went upstairs and put the letter under laurie s door but he came out before she was gone well done jo he said did he shout at you no he was quite calm said jo now go and eat your dinner you ll both feel better after it everyone thought the matter was ended but although others forgot it meg remembered she never talked about laurie s tutor but she thought of him often and dreamed her dreams and once when jo was looking for something in her sister s desk she found a bit of paper with mrs john brooke written on it over and over again oh dear said jo happier days christmas day was very different that year beth felt much better and was carried to the window to see the snowman which jo and laurie had made it had a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand and a new piece of music in the other laurie ran up and down bringing in the presents and jo sang a funny song i m so happy laughed beth as jo carried her back to the other room to rest after the fun oh i do wish that father was here too half an hour later laurie came to the house and opened the door quietly here s another christmas present for the march family he called out he moved away and in his place appeared a tall man holding the arm of another tall man who tried to say something but couldn t father cried meg and jo together and mr march disappeared under lots of loving arms and kisses mr brooke kissed meg by mistake as he tried to explain suddenly the door to the other room opened and there was beth running straight into her father s arms there were tears of happiness on many faces before all the excitement died down then mrs march thanked mr brooke for taking care ofher husband and he and laurie left the family to themselves mr march and beth sat in one big armchair and the others sat around them i wanted to surprise you all and the doctor let mr brooke bring me home said mr march john has been so good to me he is an excellent young man mr march looked at meg who was staring at the fire then he smiled at his wife she smiled back jo understood exactly what the smiles were saying and went out to the kitchen complaining to herself about excellent young men with brown eyes there never was a christmas dinner like the one they had that day mr laurence and his grandson ate with them and so did mr brooke jo gave the tutor many black looks and would not speak to him which amused laurie the guests left early and the happy family sat together around the fire a year ago we were complaining about the awful christmas we expected to have do you remember said jo it s been quite a good year said meg thinking about mr brooke i think it s been a hard one said amy i m glad it s over because we ve got father back whispered beth who was sitting on his knee i ve discovered several things about you young ladies today said mr march oh tell us what they are cried meg here s one he said taking her hand it had a small burnon the back and two or three little hard places on the front i remember when this hand was white and smooth it was pretty then but to me it s much prettier now i m proud of this hard working hand meg what about jo whispered beth she s tried so hard and has been very very good to me he smiled and looked at jo sitting opposite her hair maybe short but i see a young lady now her face is thin and white from worrying but it has grown gentler perhaps i ll miss my wild girl but i m sure i ll love the warm hearted woman who has taken her place jo s face was red in the firelight as she listened now beth said amy she s not as shy as she used to be said her father lovingly and he held beth close when he remembered how near they had come to losing her then he looked down at amy by his feet i ve noticed today that amy has helped everyone patiently and with a smile she s learned to think more about other people and less about herself beth moved out of her father s arms and went to the piano she touched the keys softly and began to sing soon the others joined her in a happy christmas song the next afternoon jo and meg were sitting at the window when laurie went by when he saw meg he fell on one knee in the snow beat his chest and put out his arms towards her when meg told him to go away he pretended to cry before walking away looking miserable meg laughed what was he doing she said he was showing you how your john will act answered jo crossly don t say my john it isn t right but meg said the words again silently inside her head if he asks yon to marry him you ll cry or look stupid in stead of saying a loud no said jo no i won t said meg i ll say thank you mr brooke you are very kind but i am too young to marry you please let us be friends as we were i don t believe it said jo it s true then i ll walk out of the room with my head high meg got up and pretended to do it but ran back to her seat when she heard someone knock on the door jo opened it with an angry look good afternoon said mr brooke i came to get my umbrella which i left behind yesterday i ll get it said jo pushing past him now meg can tell him she thought but meg was moving to the door i expect mother will want to see you she said i ll call her don t go he said are you afraid of me meg how can i be afraid when you ve been so kind to father said meg i wish i could thank you for it you can he said and he took meg s small hand in his and looked at her lovingly oh please don t she said looking frightened i only want to know if you love me a little meg he said gently i love you so much this was the moment to repeat the words she had told jo but meg forgot them all i don t know she said so softly that john had to move closer to hear her reply he smiled gratefully will you try to find out i m too young she said hesitating but feeling her heart beating rather fast i ll wait while you learn to like me he said will it be very difficult not if i choose to learn she said please choose meg i love to teach and this is easier than german said john taking her other hand she looked at him and saw that he was smiling he seemed so sure of success that meg became a little annoyed she felt excited and strange and taking her hands away from his she said i don t choose please go away poor mr brooke looked shocked do you mean that yes she said rather enjoying the game she was playing i don t want to think about these things it s to soon i ll wait until you ve had more time he said and looked so unhappy that meg began to feel sorry for him it was at this moment that aunt march came in she hadcome to see mr march and was hoping to surprise the family she did surprise two of them meg with her face bright red just stared at her aunt while mr brooke hurried into another room goodness me what s all this cried aunt march it s father s friend said meg hurriedly i m so surprised to see you aunt march i can see that said aunt march sitting down what has he said to make your face turn pink mr brooke and i were just talking said meg brooke the boy s tutor i understand now i know all about it because i made jo tell me you haven t promised to marry him have you meg if you have you won t get one bit of my money do you hear it was exactly the wrong thing to say when meg was ordered not to marry john brooke she immediately decided that she would i ll marry whoever i want to aunt march and you can give your money to anyone you like she said you ll be sorry said aunt march why don t you mar ry a rich man to help your family father and mother like john although he s poor said meg be sensible meg said her aunt he knows i have money and that s why he likes you i suspect don t say that said meg my john wouldn t marry for money any more than i would we ll work and wait and i ll be happy with him because he loves me and meg stopped as she remembered that she had told her john to go away aunt march was very angry just don t expect anything from me when you are married she said and she went out of the room banging the door behind her meg didn t know whether to laugh or cry before she could decide mr brooke came back in from the next room and puthis arms around her oh meg i could hear your voices he said thank you for proving that you do love me a little i didn t know how much until she said those things about you said meg so i can stay and be happy he said yes john she whispered and hid her face on john s chest jo returned and found them like that meg jumped and turned round but john brooke laughed and kissed the shocked jo saying sister jo wish us luck jo ran upstairs to find her parents go down quickly she said john brooke is behaving terribly and meg likes it mr and mrs march left the room in a hurry while jo threw herself on the bed and told the awful news to beth and amy but the little girls thought it was all most interesting and delightful nobody knew what was said that afternoon but a lot of talking was done the quiet mr brooke managed to persuadehis friends that his plans were good and sensible then he proudly took meg in to supper everyone looked so happy that jo tried to look pleased too after supper laurie arrived with some flowers for mrs john brooke then he followed jo into the corner of the room while the others went to welcome old mr laurence what s the matter jo said laurie you don t look very happy nothing will ever be the same again said jo sadly i ve lost my dearest friend you ve got me said laurie i m not good for much but i promise i ll always be your friend jo i know you will answered jo gratefully then don t be sad he said i ll be back from college in three years time and then we ll go abroad or on a nice trip somewhere wouldn t that cheer you up anything can happen in three years said jo that s true said laurie don t you wish you knew what was going to happen i don t think so said jo it may be something sad and everyone looks so happy now as she spoke she looked round the room and her face brightened at the sight father and mother sat happily together amy was drawing a picture of meg and john who were looking lovingly at each other beth lay on the floor talking to her old friend mr laurence jo sat in her favourite chair with a serious quietlook on her face laurie smiled at her in the long mirror that was opposite them both and jo smiled back txtba www txtba com the old seaman squire squire trelawney dr livesey and the others have asked me to write down all i know about treasure island my name is jim hawkins and i was in the story right from the start back in i was only a boy then and it all began at the time my father owned the admiral benbow inn at black hill cove i remember so clearly the day when the old seaman came to stay i can almost see him in front of me as i write he arrived with his sea chest a tall strong man with a cut across one cheek he sang that old sea sang as he walked up to the inn door fifeen men on the dead man s chest yo ho ho and a bottle of rum the old seaman called for a glass of rum and stood outside drinking and looking around our inn was on me cliffs above black hill cove and was a wild lonely place but the seaman seemed to like it do many people come here he asked no my father told him then it s the place for me said the seaman i ll stay here for a bit you can call me captain he threw down three or four gold coins tell me when i ve spent all that he was a silent man all day he walked around the cove or up on the cliffs all evening he sat in a corner of the room and drank rum and water he only spoke to our other customers when he was drunk then he told them terrible stories of his wild and criminal life at sea our customers were mostly quiet farming people the captain frightened them and they soon learned to leave him alone every day he asked if any seamen had gone along the road at first we thought he wanted friends of his own kind but then we began to understand that there was a different reason he told me to watch for a seaman with one leg and to let him know the moment when a man like that appeared he promised to give me a silver coin every month for doing this i dreamed about this one legged seaman for many nights afterwards the captain stayed week after week month after month his gold coins were soon used up but my father was a sick man and afraid to ask for more dr livesey came late one afternoon after he had seen my father he had dinner with my mother then stayed to smoke his pipe i noticed the difference between the doctor with his white hair and pleasant way of speaking and that dirty heavy red faced seaman drunk with rum the captain began to sing his song fifteen men on the dead man s chest yo ho ho and a bottle of rum drink and the devil had killed off the rest yo ho ho and a bottle of rum dr livesey did not like the song he looked up angrily before he went on talking to old taylor the gardener others in the room took no notice of the song the captain beat the table with his hand for silence the voices in the room died away all except dr livesey s the doctor continued to speak the captain swore softly then said silence are you speaking to me sir asked the doctor yes the captain told him swearing again i have only one thing to say to you sir replied the doctor if you keep on drinking rum the world will soon be free of a dirty scoundrel the captain jumped to his feet with a knife in his hand but the doctor never moved he spoke to the captain in a calm and clear voice so that others in the room could hear if you don t put that knife away i promise you shall die a criminal s death under the law then followed a battle of looks between them but the cap tain soon put away his weapon and sat down like a beaten dog soon after dr livesey rode away on his horse the captain was silent for the rest of the evening and for many evenings after wards black dog one january morning the captain got up early and walked down to the beach it was a cold winter s day with the sun still low in the sky my mother was upstairs with my father who was now very ill that year the winter was long and hard and we knew my father would not see another spring i was getting the table ready for the captain s breakfast suddenly the door of the inn opened and a man stepped inside i had never seen him before he wore a sailor s short sword by his side and i noticed he had only three fingers on his left hand i asked him what he wanted and he said i ll take a glass of rum but before i could fetch it he told me to come near him is this table for my old friend bill the stranger asked with a terrible smile i told him i did not know his friend bill and the breakfast was for a man who was staying at the inn we call him the captain i said does he have a sword cut on his face he asked yes i said that s bill said the stranger is he here i told him the captain was out walking and the man waited like a cat waiting for a mouse i did not like the look on his face and was sure the captain would not be pleased to see him when the captain came back the man pulled me behind the door the captain opened the door and walked across the room bill said the stranger the captain turned quickly and saw us the colour went from his face and be looked old and sick black dog he said he stared at the stranger and what do you want i ll have a glass of rum said black dog then you and i ll sit and talk like old friends i fetched the rum and they told me to go away i went out of the room but the voices became louder no no and that s an end of it i heard the captain shout if one is caught we ll all be caught there were more shouts and then the sound of the table crashing over next i heard the sound of swords then out ran black dog with blood running down his shoulder he ran out of the inn and along the road in a few seconds he had disap peared from sight the captain watched him go then said jim quick bring me rum he turned and went back into the inn but he could only just stand on his feet i realized he was feeling ill and ran to fetch the rum then i heard him falling and hurried back to find him on the floor my mother heard the noise and came downstairs we lifted the captain s head his eyes were closed and his face was a ter rible colour at that moment dr livesey arrived to see my father he looked at the captain and said to my mother his heart can t take much more of this i told him drinking rum would kill him and it nearly has the captain opened his eyes and tried to sit up where s black dog he asked there s no black dog here said the doctor get on your feet and i ll help you to your bed the black spot later that day i took the captain a cool drink jim he said you re the only person here worth anything you ll bring me some rum won t you boy the doctor said i began he swore about the doctor look jim one glass is all i ask i ll pay you for it the only money i want i said is the money you owe my father but i ll get you one glass of rum no more he was grateful and drank it quickly did the doctor say how long i must lie in my bed he asked a week i told him a week he cried i can t do that they ll have the black spot on me by then they ll come for me who will black dog i said yes but there s worse than him it s my old sea chest they want but i ll show them jim if i get the black spot you go to that doctor tell him to bring a crowd of law officers and a local judge to the inn they can catch flint s crew all that are left at the admiral benbow i was flint s first ship s officer and i m the only one who knows the place he told me when he was dying but don t call the law unless they give me the black spot or if you see the seaman with one leg he s worse than any of them but what is the black spot captain i asked that s a message boy i ll tell you if they give me that keep your eyes open jim and i ll give you half of everything i have he talked for a little longer then fell into a heavy sleep and i left him that night my father died this put all other thoughts to one side and i had no time to worry about the captain the next morning the captain came downstairs he didn t eat much food but he drank more rum than usual he helped himself and we were too busy to stop him there were visits from neighbours and my father s burial to arrange the day after the burial was cold and foggy at about three o clock in the afternoon i was standing at the door of the inn when i saw a blind man coming along the road he was feeling his way with a stick will any kind friend tell a poor blind man where he is he said you re at the admiral benbow inn black hill cove my good man i said i hear a young voice he said will you give me your hand my kind young friend and take me inside i held out my hand and the terrible soft speaking eyeless man took hold of it like a dog biting a bone he pulled me vio lently towards him now boy he said take me to the captain or i ll break your arm and i had never heard a voice so cruel and cold i was so frightened by the blind man s violence that i obeyed him without question and took him into the room where the sick captain was sitting he saw the blind man and a look of fear passed across his face sit where you are bill said the blind man i can t see but i can hear a finger move hold out your right hand i watched him put something in the captain s hand and now that s done said the blind man and he quickly went out of the inn i heard his stick tap tap tapping away along the road the captain opened his hand and looked into it ten o clock he cried and jumped up he put his hand round his neck made a strange sound and fell face down on to the floor i ran to him calling to my mother but the captain was dead the sea chest on the floor close to the captain s hand was a little round piece of paper blackened on one side i had no doubt that this was the black spot on the other side was some writ ing you have till ten o clock tonight our old clock reminded me it was now six quickly i told my mother everything and we decided to run to the village to hide before the blind man and his friends re turned but first my mother said bravely we have to get the key to the sea chest why shouldn t we take the money the captain owes us his friends certainly won t give it to us the key was around his neck on a piece of string i cut the string and we hurried up to his room where the chest had stood since the day he came there was a letter b painted on the top of it inside were two very fine pistols some silver pipe tobacco and an old clock underneath these things were some papers tied up inside a cloth and a bag of gold coins i ll show these scoundrels i m an honest woman said my mother i ll take what i m owed and no more she began counting the money there were all kinds of gold coins in the bag big french gold coins spanish doubloons and pieces of eight it was slow work to find the english gold guineas that we needed we were half way through when i heard a sound that filled my heart with fear the tap tapping of the blind man s stick on the frozen road then it knocked against the inn door and we did not breathe but then the tapping started again and slowly died away mother i said take it all and let s go before the blind man comes back with his friends but my mother went on counting until we heard a low shout coming from the hill outside i ll take what i have she said jumping to her feet and i ll take this for what i m owed i said and picked up the cloth of papers we ran from the inn and along the road to the village it was dark but there was a full moon we heard running feet coming towards us take the money and run on my mother said breathlessly but i refused to leave her quickly i pulled her off the road and down under a small bridge there we hid trembling not a moment too soon seven or eight men were running past us three men ran in front and i saw that the one in the middle was the blind man silently i climbed back up to the road and lay in the long grass to watch what happened down with the door the blind man shouted four or five of them broke down the door of the admiral benbow and ran inside there was a shout bill s dead the blind man swore at them look upstairs and find the chest he cried i could hear their feet on the stairs then a voice shouting down to the blind man in the road outside pew they ve been here before us the money s here but flint s papers have gone it s those people of the inn it s that boy shouted the blind man pew search and find em just then there came the sound of horses and riders thunder ing along the road it was heard by the men in the inn and in a second they were out in the road running into the darkness of the fields they did not wait for blind pew who tried to follow them tapping wildly with his stick johnny black dog you won t leave your old friend pew boys not old pew he was still in the middle of the road when the horses thun dered up to the inn pew turned with a scream but he turned the wrong way and ran straight into the first of the horses the rider tried to save him but failed down went pew under the horse s feet with a cry that rang high into the night it was all over in seconds and pew didn t move again i jumped up and shouted to the riders one of the men was captain dance the law officer from the nearby town he had head reports of a pirate ship in black hill cove and had come looking for the pirates i told him my story and he and his men chased the pirates down into the cove but by the time they got to the beach the ship was already out to sea well said captain dance when he returned at least we finished off pew we took my mother to a house in the villag then went back to the admiral benbow inside everything was smashed and broken what were they looking for hawkins asked mr dance they got the money from the chest i said but i think i have what they wanted most i d like to get it to a safe place i thought perhaps dr livesey quite right said mr dance he s the local judge and i ought to report pew s death to him or squire trelawney i ll take you with me to his house dr livesey was not at his house but with the squire at his home so captain dance and i went on there i had never seen squire trelawney so near he was a big tall man with a red face and was sitting beside a fire with dr livesey come in mr dance he said mr dance gave his report and both men listened with deep interest and so jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were looking for have you here it is sir i said and gave him the papers tied inside the cloth the doctor looked at them and put them quietly in the pocket of his coat after that mr dance went away and i was given some food and now squire said the doctor you have heard of this flint i suppose heard of him cried the squire he was the worst pirate that ever sailed the spanish used to tremble just to hear his name well i ve heard of him myself said dr livesey but the question is did he have money money said the squire of course flint had money those scoundrels were after it well then suppose i have here in my pocket a paper that shows where flint hid his treasure said the doctor would the treasure be worth looking for worth looking for cried the squire with great enthusiasm i ll tell you what it s worth i ll prepare a ship at bristol take you and hawkins with me and have that trea sure if i have to search for a year we opened the cloth and found two things a book and a paper the book gave a list of all the money flint had stolen from different ships during twenty years at sea the doctor opened the paper and found a map of an island there was a hill in the centre marked spyglass and several names that had been added later there were three big black crosses two in the north of the island and one in the south west beside the last cross were the words most of the treasure here on the back of the paper the same person had written tall tree spyglass shoulder to the north of north north east skeleton island east south east and by east the squire and dr llvesey were delighted tomorrow i start for bristol said squire trelawney in three weeks we will have the best ship ir and the finest crew in england hawkins can come as cabin boy you livesey are the ship s doctor i am admiral we ll take three of my men redruth joyce and hunter trelawney said the doctor i ll go with you so i am sure will hawkins there s only one man i m afraid of and who s that cried the squire name the scoundrel you said the doctor because you cannot keep silent we aren t the only men who know of this paper those who broke into the inn tonight want to find the same treasure we must none of us go alone until we get to sea you ll take joyce and hunter to bristol meanwhile jim and i will stay together and not one of us must say a word about what we have found livesey replied the squire you re always right i ll be as silent as a dead man i go to bristol dr livesey went to london to find another doctor to look after his patients while he was away i waited at his home with tom redruth weeks passed and i spent many hours studying flint s map and dreaming of treasure then a letter arrived addressed to dr livesey or jim hawkins if the doctor is away old anchor lnn bristol st march dear livesey i do not know whether you are at home or in london so iam sending copies of this letter to both places the ship is bought and ready for sea you never saw a bet ter ship and with the name hispaniola i got her through my old friend blandly who with everyone in bristol worked hard to find me a suitable ship when they heard the reason for our voyage treasure i mean dr livesey won t like that i said to tom redruth the squire s been talking i read on i wanted a crew of twenty men as we may meet pirates or enemy ships but i had the greatest difficulty finding six then good fortune brought me the very man that i needed i met the man quite by accident and we began a conversation i learnt he was an old seaman who kept an inn and he knew all the seamen in bristol the poor man had lost his health on shore and wanted to get work as a cook and go to sea again i felt sorry for him and employed him immediately to be the ship s cook long john silver he is called and he has lost a leg fighting for his country well sir i thought i had only found a cook but it was a crew i had discovered between silver and myself we got together a crew of the toughest seamen you can imagine i am in wonderful health but i shall not enjoy a moment un til my ship goes to sea so come quickly livesey do not lose an hour and let young hawkins go at once to say goodbye to his mother and then come quickly to bristol with redruth john trelawney ps blandly found us an excellent man to be captain and sil ver found a man called arrow to be first officer next day i went to the admiral benbow and said goodbye to my mother i was sad to leave but when redruth and i began our journey to bristol my thoughts turned to the voyage and the search for treasure mr trelawney was waiting for us at an inn near the sea here you are he cried when we arrived the doctor came from london last night so now the ship s company is complete we sail tomorrow after i had finished breakfast the squire gave me a note to take to long john silver at the spyglass inn it was a bright little place where the customers were mostly seamen as i entered a man came out of a side room and i knew immediately he must be long john his left leg was cut off above the knee and he walked with a crutch under his left shoulder he was tall and strong with a big smiling face now when i read about long john in squire trelawney s letter i had been afraid he might be the one legged seamanthat old bill had talked about but one look at the man in front of me was enough i knew old bill and black dog and the blind man pew i thought i knew what a pirate looked like a very different person from this clean and smiling man mr silver sir i asked holding out the note yes my boy he said that s my name and who are you and then he saw the squire s letter and looked surprised oh he said loudly i see you re our new cabin boy i m pleased to meet you just then a customer got up suddenly and hurried to the door i recognized him as the man with only three fingers on his left hand the one who had come to the admiral benbow stop him i shouted it s black dog i don t care who he is said silver he hasn t paid for his drinks run and catch him harry a man jumped up and ran after black dog what was his name asked silver black what dog sir i said hasn t mr trelawney told you about the pirates he was one of them a pirate i didn t know that said silver i ve seen him before when he came with a blind man that was blind pew another pirate i said that was his name said silver i watched the sea cook carefully but when the man harry came back without the pirate silver seemed angry and i be lieved he was i ll come with you to tell mr trelawney what s happened he said this is a serious matter as we walked back silver told me many interesting things about the ships that we passed i began to think he was going to be a good companion to have when we were at sea when we got to the inn the squire and dr livesey were there long john told them about black dog saying that was how it was wasn t it hawkins and i had to agree we were all sorry about black dog getting away but there was nothing we could do all the crew must be on board by four o clock this after noon trelawney told long john right sir said the sea cook and he left us to return to his inn trelawney said dr livesey i don t always think you find the best men but i ll say this john silver seems a good man now let s go and see the ship the ship and its men we went out to the his paniola in a small boat mr ar row met us and it was clear that he and the squire were very friendly but things were not the same between mr trelawney and the captain captain smollett seemed angry with everybody on board and told us why i don t like this voyage he told us i don t like the men and i don t like my first officer perhaps sir you don t like the ship said the squire an grily i can t say that sir as i haven t yet sailed her replied the captain she seems a good ship possibly sir you don t like your employer either said the squire now now let s not argue said dr livesey he turned to the captain you say you don t like this voyage he said please explain i was employed sir said the captain on secret orders and to sail this ship where that gentleman ordered me to sail it now i find every other man on this ship knows more than i do i don t call that fair do you no said dr livesey i don t next said the captain i learn we are going to look for treasure hear it from my own crew now i don t like trea sure voyages at the best of times and i certainly don t like them when they are secret also a captain is usually allowed to choose his own crew that s true agreed the doctor and you don t like mr arrow no sir replied captain smollett he s too friendly with the crew tell us what you want said the doctor first of all the men are putting the powder and weapons in the front of the ship said the captain now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them there second you are bringing four of your own people let them sleep here be side the cabin what else asked mr trelawney only one thing sir said the captain there s been too much talking already i ll tell you what i ve heard that you have a map of an island that there s crosses on the map to show where treasure is and that the island is then he told us the exact place i never told that to anyone cried the squire the crew know it sir replied the captain i don t know who has this map but i want it to be kept secret even from me and mr arrow if not i will ask you to let me leave the ship you want us to keep all this a secret said the doctor and you want all the weapons and powder to be kept near us in other words you fear a mutiny i did not say that sir replied captain smoll ett no cap tain could go to sea believing that and he went away trelawney said the doctor i believe you have managed to get two honest men on board that man and john silver silver yes said the squire but the captain acts neither like a man nor a good seaman well said the doctor we shall see we were moving the weapons and powder when long john came aboard the cook came up the side as quick as a monkey and saw what we were doing what s this he wanted to know my orders said the captain coldly you may go below my man the crew will want supper yes sir said the cook and disappeared quickly that s a good man captain said the doctor that may be sir replied captain smollett the apple barrel we sailed at the first light of day i was more tired than ever before but everything was so new and interest ing i would not leave the deck let s have a song cried one of the men long john began to sing that song i knew so well fifteen men on the dead man s chest and the whole crew joined with him yo ho ho and a bottle of rum even at that exciting moment i remembered the old admi ral benbow and i seemed to hear the voice of old bill thr sea man singing with them but soon the sails began to fill with wind and the land and other ships moved past on each side the hispaniola had begun her voyage to treasure island i am not going to describe the voyage in detail the ship was indeed a good ship the crew were good seamen and the captain knew his business well but mr arrow was even worse than the captain had feared the men did as they pleased with him and after a day or two at sea he began to drink too much where he got the drink was a mystery and if we asked him he would only laugh then one wild dark night with a rough sea he disappeared and was seen no more fallen overboard said the captain gentlemen we ll do better without him but we were without a first officer mr trelawney had been to sea before and knew enough to be useful and one of the men israel hands was a careful and experienced seaman who was able to help with almost anything he was a great friend of long john silver all the crew liked and even obeyed silver and he was always pleased to see me in the kitchen which he kept as clean as a new pin he kept his parrot in cage in the corner i call him captain flint he told me after the famous pi rate and the parrot used to scream pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight the captain and mr trelawney still did not like each other and the squire didn t try to hide it the captain spoke few words but agreed that the crew were better than he d hoprd for and that the ship was a fine one the crew seemed happy which was not really surprising no ship s company was ever so well looked after with plenty to eat and drink and a barrel of apples open for any man to take one and it was the apple barrel that saved our lives it was the day before we expected to see treasure island the sun had gone down all my work was done and i thought i should like an apple the barrel was nearly empty and i had to climb right inside to get my apple as i sat there in the dark the ship moving gently in the water i almost fell asleep suddenly the barrel shook as a heavy man sat down and rested his shoulders against it the man began to speak and it was silver s voice before i had heard a dozen words i was trembling with fear i understood from those words that the lives of all honest men on the ship depended on me alone flint was captain ot me said silver in the same battle that i lost my leg old pew lost his sight but i got two thou sand when i sailed with flint and it s all safe in the bank at home but what if you don t live to get home again asked an other doubtful voice i recognized the voice of the youngest seaman aboard pirates live rough agreed silver they live dangerously and some get caught and die by the law but they eat and drink the best and when the voyage is done it s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds ofpence in their pockets once i m back from this trip i ll live like a gentleman but i began life like you a clever young seaman without a penny in my pocket i didn t like this job until this talk woth you john said the young seaman but i m with you now they shook hands so hard that the barrel shook as well with me inside it by this time i understood that silver had just turned an honest seaman into a pirate perhaps every man in the crew was now a pirate silver gave a quiet call and a third man came and sat down with them dick s with us said silver i knew dick was all right replied the voice of israel hands but how long are we going to wait i ve had enoughof captain smollett until the last moment cried silver captain smollett s a first class seaman and the squire and doctor have the map let them find the treasure and bring it aboard then we ll see i d rather have captain smollett sail us half way home before i moved but i know the rest of the men won t wait that long so i ll finish with the captain and the others at the island but what do we do with them asked dick they must die said silver we don t want them coming home later to tell what happened now dick get me an apple i m thirsty you can imagine my horror i heard dick begin to rise but hands said oh let s have some rum john silver sent dick to fetch the rum then israel said something to the cook in a low voice and i heard only a word or two but they were important words not another man will join so there were still some honest men on board i looked up and saw the moon had risen at the same time the voice of one of the crew shouted land there was the sound of many feet running across the deck i quickly got out of the barrel and was in time to join hunter and dr livesey and the rest at the side of the ship away to the south west we saw two hills rising behind one of them was a third hill even higher and with its top still hid den in fog captain smollett gave orders and the hispaniola turned so that the ship would sail just clear of the island on the east has anyone seen that land before he said i have sir said silver i was cook on a ship that stopped here once there s a safe place to anchor in the south behind a little island called skeleton island those three hills we can see are on the big island they re in a row running south the biggest is called spyglass thank you said captain smollett later on i ll ask you to give us some help you may go now dr livesey called me meaning to ask me to fetch his pipe but i spoke quickly doctor get the captain and squire down to the cabin i have some terrible news he went across and spoke to the other two then the three of them went below soon after a message came that i was want ed in the cabin i told them in as few words as possible what sliver and the others had said and they listened without speaking it was a warm night and i saw the moon shining on the sea as i told my story captain said the squire when i d finished you were right and i was wrong but i ve never known a crew planning to mutiny that did not show some sign of it before said the captain that s silver said the doctor he s a very clever man he d look very clever with a rope around his neck sir replied the captain but we must make a plan we can t go back or they would know at once but we have some time be fore the treasure is found and there are some honest men a mong the crew your men squire as honest as myself agreed mr trelawney and ourselves said the captain that s seven with young hawkins here now what other honest men are there probably the men trelawney chose before he met silver said the doctor no said the squire hands was one of them well gentlemen said the captain we must wait and watch carefully until we know our men treasure island next morning there was no wind and we were half a mile from the eastern coast of the island although the sun shone bright and hot i hated the thought of treasure is land afraid of what would happen there because there was no wind the small boats pulled the ship three or four miles round the island to a safe place to drop the anchor i went in one of them it was hard work pulling the ship and the men argued af terwards they sat around the deck and the smallest order was received with an angry look if i give another order said the captain the whole crew will mutiny only one man can help us and who is that asked the squire silver replied the captain he wants to keep things calm as much as we do he wants the men to wait let s allow them an afternoon on shore if they all go we ll have the ship if some go silver will bring them back as gentle as sheep guns were given to all the honest men hunter joyce and redruth were told what was happening and were less sur prised than we expected them to be then the captain went on deck to talk to the crew men you ve had a hot tiring day he said the boats are still in the water any man who wants to can go ashore for the afternoon you ll hear a gun half an hour before the sun goes down to call you back they all became happier at once i think they thought they would find the treasure lying around on the beach after some talk six men stayed on board and the others with silver got into the small boats i then had the first of the mad ideas that helped to save our lives if six men were left we could not take control of the ship and because only six were left the captain s men did not need my help so i quickly went over the ship s side and into the nearest boat no one took much notice of me only one man saying is that you jim but silver called from the other boat wanting to know if it was me then i began to worry if i had done the right thing the crews rowed to the beach and our boat arrived first i ran towards the trees silver and the rest were a hundred me tres behind and i heard him shouting jim jim but i took no notice pushing through trees and bushes and ran until i could run no longer i was pleased to lose long john and began to enjoy looking around this strange island i crossed wet ground and came to a long open piece of sand then went on to a place where the trees had branches that were thick and close to the sand just then i heard distant voices sliver s among them and hid behind a tree through the leaves i saw long john silver and another of the crew talking together i m warning you because i m your friend tom silver was saying silver said tom you re old and you re honest or so men say and you ve money too which lots of poor seamen haven t and you re brave why let yourself be led away with that kind of scoundrel i d rather die than suddenly there was a noise of distant shouting then a long horrible scream i had found one honest man here and that ter rible distant scream told me of another john said tom what was that that replied silver his eyes shone like pieces of broken glass in the sun that ll be alan alan cried poor tom an honest and true seaman john silver you ve been a friend of mine but for no longer you ve killed alan have you then kill me too if you can the brave man turned his back on silver and began to walk back to the beach with a shout silver threw his crutch through the air it hit poor tom between the shoulders and he fell to the ground with a cry silver as quick as a monkey was on top of him in a moment twice he dug his knife into that poor body as i watched the whole world seemed to swim away before me in a mist silver the birds above the tall spyglass hill when i was myself again silver was standing with his crutchunder his arm cleaning the blood from his knife with some grass as silently as i could i began to move away and as soon as was clear of the trees began to run as i had never run before the man of the island but almost immediately i ran into a new danger as i ran i heard some small stones falling from the side of a steep hill i stopped to look round and saw a figure jump quickly behind a tree frightened i turned back towards the boats but the figure appeared again and moved with the speedof an animal but it was a man i knew that now i remembered i had a pistol if i needed it and turned back towards this man of the island he was hiding behind another tree but stepped out to meet me who are you i asked staring at him ben gunn he answered and his voice sounded rough andstrange his skin was burnt nearly black by the sun and his clothes were made from pieces of a ship s sail poor ben gunn he went on alone for three years were you shipwrecked i asked no my friend he said marooned i had heard the word before and knew it meant a cruel pun ishment often used by pirates leaving a man alone on some distant empty island marooned three years he continued living on wild goats and fish but i m desperate for real english food you don t have a piece of cheese do you many nights i ve dreamed of cheese if i can get on board ship again i said you can have as much cheese as you want who s going to prevent you he said and tell me your name jim i told him well jim he said looking around and lowering his voice to a whisper i m rich i was now sure the poor man was crazy but he repeated his words rich i say now jim that isn t flint s ship is it i began to think that i had found a friend and i answered him at once it s not flint s ship flint is dead but there are some of flint s men aboard and that s bad news for us a man with one leg he asked fear in his voice silver i asked yes silver he said that was his name he s the cook and their leader too and i told him the whole story of our voyage and the danger we were now in you re in trouble jim he said when i d finished well ben gunn will help you will your squire be generous if i do do you think i don t want him to give me a job but will he give me one thousand pounds out of money that s really mine i m sure he will i said and take me home on your ship if we can escape from the others i told him we ll need your help to get the ship home he seemed happy with this i was in flint s ship when he and six seamen hid the treasure he said they were on shore nearly a week then flint came back alone not a man on board could guess how he had killed the others then i was in another ship three years ago and we saw this island boys i said let s go ashore and find flint s treasure twelve days we searched and the men got angrier with me every day then they went back to the ship ben gunn they said you can stay here and find flint s money here s a gun a spade and an axe well jim i ve been here for three years and no real food from that day to this but i ve found things to do oh yes here he closed one eye and smiled at me now go to your squire and tell him ben gunn is a good man i will i said but how will i get on board there s my boat that i made with my two hands he said i keep her under the white rock we might try that after dark although there was another hour before the sun went down we suddenly heard the sound of the ship s gun they ve begun to fight i cried follow me inside the stockade we followed the noise of the fighting and came to a hill there stood a strong wooden house big enough for forty people and with holes for guns on every side all around the house was a wide open piece of land and around that was a fence two metres high with no doors or openings and too strong to pull down easily as soon as ben gunn saw the english flag flying over thehouse he said there are your friends more likely to be the pirates i answered silver would put up the pirate s flag the jolly roger said ben no there s been a fight and your friends have won they re inside the stockade that flint made years ago then i must hurry and join them i said he wouldn t come with me i won t come until you ve seen your gentleman and got his promise you know where to find me jim and if the pirates sleep on shore tonight one of them might have an unpleasant surprise the ship s gun boomed and the shot fell only a hundredmetres away ben gunn and i each ran our different ways thefiring continued for another hour and i moved quietly through the trees to the shore there i saw the hispaniola in the bay but the jolly roger was flying over her on the beach the pirates were breaking up the captain s little boat with axes when the ship s gun stopped firing i went back to the stockade doctor i shouted squire captain hello hunter is that you dr livesey came out of the house in time to see me climbing into the stockade and my friends welcomed me happily they gave me supper although they were worried because there was little food left as i ate dr livesey told me their story we heard you had gone ashore on one of the boats jim he said we never doubted your honesty but we were afraid you wouldn t be safe hunter and i came ashore to see what was happening and found the stockade it seemed a good place to defend ourselves against silver and his men because we were sure they would kill us when they returned to the ship here all we needed was enough food and people to watch for enemies you see we know that if the hispaniola does not return to bristol by the end of august a rescue ship will be sent to look for us so we made a plan to get ourselves off the ship dr livesey went on hunter redruth and joyce helped us hunter brought the captain s little boat round under the cabin window and joyce and i put guns and food and my medicine chest in it redruth took four guns and went on deck with trelawney and the captain they were able to surprise israel hands and the other men and they managed to persuade one man abraham gray to join us again so you left five pirates on the ship i said yes said dr livesey and we dropped the rest of the weapons over the side into the sea before leaving the ship but we forgot the ship s gun we were half way to the island when the pirates fired it at us i heard it i told him trelawney tried to shoot hands but killed another man instead said dr livesey the pirates on the island heard the gun and ran out of the trees towards their boats then our small boat began to go down and we found ourselves in the water most of the food was lost and we had only two dry guns out of five somehow we got ashore and into the stockade but we knew there was going to be a fight but you won i said yes agreed dr livesey we killed another of their men badly wounded another but lost one of our own poor tom redruth after the doctor had finished i told them my story andabout ben gunn then we began to talk about what to donext our best plan was to kill the pirates one by one until the rest ran off or sailed away in the ship i was very tired and fell asleep as the three men talked it was the sound of voices shouting that woke me the next morning a white flag i heard someone say it s silver i ran to a hole in the wall and looked through two men were outside the stockade one waving a white cloth the other man was silver it was a very cold morning the sky bright and without a cloud but silver and his man were standing in a low mist what do you want shouted captain smollett the man beside silver replied cap n silver sir to talk about peace cap n silver said the captain who is he long john answered me sir the men chose me to be captain after you deserted the ship we re willing to make peace if we can all agree all i ask is your promise to allow me safely out of the stockade i don t want to talk to you said captain smollett but if you want to talk to me you may come silver came towards the stockade threw his crutch over the fence then climbed after it with great difficulty he walked up the hill of soft sand aren t you going to let me inside said long john it s a cold morning to be outside if you were an honest man silver said the captain you could be in your kitchen you re either my ship s cook or cap n silver a dirty pirate now if you ve anything to say say it well now cap n smollett said silver sitting down in the sand you were very clever last night one of you is very quick with a knife isn t he some of my men were frightened and perhaps i was too perhaps that s why i m here now but you won t do it again by thunder we ll drink less rum and watch more carefully i was asleep but i almost caught you the man you knifed wasn t dead when i reached him well said captain smollett pretending to understand but i guessed what silver was talking about i remembered ben gunn s last words to me perhaps he had visited the pirates during the night when they were lying around their fire full of rum we want that treasure and we ll have it said silver now you have a map give it to us and stop killing poor sea men when they re asleep and we ll let you choose what to do either come aboard ship with us when we have the treasure and we ll take you to a safe place or stay here on the island is that all asked captain smollett it s my last word by thunder said silver refuse and you ll all die now you ll hear me said the captain if you come up one by one without weapons i ll take you home to a fair trial in england you can t find the treasure without the map none of you knows how to sail the ship home and you can t fight us gray got away from five of you if you say no the next time i see you i ll put a bullet in your back now get out of here quickly silver s eyes were filled with anger somebody help me up he shouted but none of us moved swearing angrily he pulled himself across the sand to the fence there he was able to lift himself on to his crutch again and then climb out of the stockade before the hour is over shouted silver i ll break your old house like a rum bottle and those that die will be the lucky ones as soon as silver disappeared we got ready for a battle placing ourselves around the sides of the stockade the captain went round to check our places and our guns and to see that everything was ready a minute later joyce fired his pistol and the battle had be gun shots came from every side of the stockade hitting the wooden house but the bullets did not get through the thick walls then there was silence and the smoke slowly cleared away suddenly guns were fired again and a group of pirates ran from the woods and on to the stockade they climbed over the fence like monkeys while the squire and gray fired at them in a few seconds two fell dead one was running back into the trees and four were inside the stockade fight them in the open cried the captain i took a sword and ran out into the sun more pirates were starting to climb into the stockade one man wearing a red cap and with a knife in his mouth was already on top of the fence but in that moment the fight was over and we had won gray cut down one man with his sword another was shot as he fired into the house and now lay wounded with his smoking pistol in his hand the doctor had cut down a third the men on the fence had disappeared back into the trees and of the four who had climbed into the stockade only one was not wounded and he was climbing out again with the fear of death in him sea adventure the doctor gray and i ran back into the house we saw hunter lying still after a knock on the head joyce lay dead shot through the head and the squire was half carrying the wounded captain the pirates did not return and we had time to take care of the wounded out of the eight men who fell in the fight only three still breathed one pirate hunter and captain smollett and of these the first two were nearly dead the pirate died first then hunter only a few hours later the captain s wounds were bad but not dangerous the doctor told him he must not walk or move his arm and to speak only when it was necessary after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain s side and talked then a little past noon the doctor took his hat his pistols and a sword put the map in his pocket and walked off quickly through the trees i guessed he was going to see ben gunn and thought the doctor was lucky to be walking in the cool shadows of the wood the house was hot and smelt of blood and there were dead bodies lying all around suddenly i wanted to get away from that place and i had an idea i would go and look for ben gunn s boat perhaps we would need it some time that was my excuse to myself although i knew it was wrong of me to leave only two unwounded men to guard the stockade it was also wrong of me to leave secretly but that is what i did i filled my pockets with bread then took two pistols and the powder for them when gray and mr trelawney were helping the captain i climbed quickly out of the stockade and ran into the trees i made my way towards the east coast it was late in the afternoon but still warm soon cool air began to reach me and suddenly there was the sea i walked along the edge then up to a small sand covered hill ben gunn had told me his boat was hidden near the white rock and i found that rock farther along the beach the little boat was hidden in the grass a small rough thing made of wood and goat skins i knew i should go back to the stockade now but an idea came to me and i sat down to wait for darkness as the last of the day disappeared there were two lights in the blackness one came from a great fire on the shore where the pirates sat singing and drinking the other came from the hispaniola out at sea i put the small boat on my shoulders and carried it to the edge of the water then i put it in the sea it was a very safe boat but difficult to control it turned every way except the one i wanted to go the sea carried me out to the hispaniola i knew if i cut the anchor rope at the wrong moment the hispaniola would make a sudden move out to sea and my boat might be knocked out of the water so i took my knife and cut almost through the rope then waited listening to the sound of two loud voices coming from the cabin both men sounded drunk and both were angry at last the wind turned the ship towards me and now i cut all the way through the rope as fast as i could i pushed my little boat along the side of the ship desperate to get away before the ship crashed into me just as i gave the final push my hand found a rope over the end of the ship i don t know why i took hold of the rope but i did i pulled my boat near to the ship then stood up to see through the cabin window i had wondered why the two men weren t on deck but one look through the window gave me my answer it was israel hands and the man in the red cap now locked in battle each with a hand round the other s neck i dropped down in the boat again looking over my shoulder at the shore and there right behind me was the pirate s fire on the beach then the wind with sudden violence turned the hispaniola and my little boat with it and we were both sailing fast into the open sea there were sudden shouts and the sound of hurrying feet as the two men ran on deck i lay down in my boat sure that when we reached the rough open water that would be the end for me i lay there for many hours but at last i fell asleep and in my small helpless boat dreamed of home and the admiral benbow it was daylight when i woke up the sun was still hidden be hind spyglass hill which came down to the sea in dangerous cliffs on this side of the island it was no place to row ashore or i would be killed on the rocks also the boat was so small that when i rowed the waves came over the sides of the boat i decided to wait until the sea took me somewhere safer on the north side of the island i must keep the water out of the boat i thought but i can row a little in the smooth places it was very tiring work and it kept me busy so that i did not look up and see the hispaniola until she was just half a mile away from me but something strange was happening to her first the ship turned north then suddenly to the west a gain she s out of control i thought then the ship turned again big and dangerous as she came closer and closer to ben gunn s little boat suddenly i was on the top of one wave as she came thundering over the next and there she was almost upon me i jumped up pushed the boat under the water with my feet and caught one of the ship s ropes then i heard the hispaniola hit the little boat and i was left with no way to escape israel hands i lost no time and climbed up the rope on to the deck of the ship the two men were there red cap on his back israel hands against the side his face white there was dark blood around them on the deck and i was sure each had killed the other in their drunken fight then israel hands turned with a low cry of pain he looked across at me and whispered one word rum i went below to the cabin where there were empty bottles on the floor and tobacco smoke filled the air i found a bottle with some rum left in it and found some water and some bread and cheese for myself i took the bottle back on deck where hands drank half the rum before taking the bottle from his mouth by thunder he said i wanted some of that but where have you come from i ve come to take control of this ship mr hands i said so please remember i m your captain he watched me pull down the jolly roger and throw it overboard then he said i expect you ll want to go ashore now suppose we talk about it there was some colour back in his cheeks but he looked very sick who s going to sail the ship now you can t do it but if you give me food and drink and a handkerchief to tie up my wound i ll tell you how to sail her all right i agreed we ll go into north inlet and quietly put her on the beach there in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island then i went be low and got a handkerchief and helped hands tie up the great bleeding wound in his leg he ate a little and drank more of the rum then he began to look a little better we sailed ahead of the wind the island moving past quickly after my success i was less sorry about deserting the stockade there was only one thing that worried me it was the way israel hands watched me at my work a cold little smile on his face we could not put the ship on the beach when we reached north inlet because the sea was too high we had to wait sit ting in silence over another meal cap n hands said to me still with that smile on his face my old mate o brien is dead can you throw him overboard i m not strong enough i said there was a pause then he said well now would you be very kind and go down to the cabin and fetch me a bottle of wine jim this rum s too strong for my head i listened to his words but didn t believe them he wanted me to leave the deck that was clear but why wine i said will you have white or red i don t mind he said as long as it s strong and there s plenty of it i ll have to search for it i told him i went below then took off my shoes and went quietly up the other stairs to watch him he was on his hands and knees and although his leg hurt him he moved quickly across the deck and took a long knife from among some ropes i could see the blood on it then he hid it under his coat and went back to his place this was all i needed to know israel hands could move about and now had a weapon and he was going to try to kill me but i knew that he wouldn t use the knife until the ship was safely on the beach i went back to the cabin put my shoes on again and picked up a bottle of wine then i went back up on deck he took a long drink from the bottle of wine saying here s luck afterwards we sailed into north inlet and i forgot to watch hands carefully we were nearly on the beach and i was looking over the side of the ship perhaps i heard a sound or saw his shadow moving i don t know but when i looked round there he was half way towards me with the knife in his right hand he threw himself at me and i jumped to one side leaving him to fall on the deck quickly i took a pistol from my pocket and aimed it at him he powder was wet and the pistol didn t fire he got up and came at me with surprising speed but suddenly the hispaniola hit the sand and went over on one side we were both thrown down and began to roll across the deck but i was on my feet first and climbed up into the sails hand over hand when i was in a safe place i loaded my pistols this time with dry powder hands was pulling himself up among the sails now the knife between his teeth one more step i said and i ll kill you jim he said he took the knife from his mouth to speak and looked beaten we ll have to make peace you and i you re too sharp and quick for an old sailor like me but then with a sudden movement his hand went back and something went speeding through the air i felt a sharp pain and i was pinned to the mast by my shoulder in the terrible pain and surprise of the moment both my pistols went off and fell from my hands they did not fall alone with a cry hands fell into the water he came up the water around him red from his blood then he went down again for ever i felt sick and frightened the blood from my wound ran over my back and chest and the knife seemed to burn like hot iron but i was trembling so badly that it shook the knife out of my skin and i could move again i climbed down through the sails then went below to tie up my wound there was a lot of blood but it wasn t deep next i went up on deck it was now evening and a light wind was blowing so i lowered the sails before climbing down a rope and into the sea the water was only waist deep and i walked ashore the sun had gone now and once on dry land i began to walk to the stockade perhaps the others would blame me for deserting i thought but captain smollett would be pleased i had taken the hispaniola i was sure when i reached the stockade the house lay in dark shadow but on the other side a large fire had almost burned itself out this seemed strange as it had not been our habit to build lange fires there were no sounds except for the wind in the trees and i went quietly round to the eastern side keeping in the shadows as i came nearer to the corner of the house i heard my friends breathing loudly as they slept and at once felt happier again i got to the door and looked in but all was dark and i could see nothing with my arms out in front of me i walked in suddenly there was a high voice screaming in the darkness pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight it was silver s parrot captain flint immediately men began to wake up and i heard silver s voice shout who s there i turned to run crashed violently against one person then ran straight into the arms of another a prisoner of the enemy somebody brought a light and i saw the inside of the house five pirates were on their feet and another man was lying down with a head wound but my heart became filled with fear when i saw no prisoners were my friends all dead here s jim hawkins said silver how friendly of you to visit us jim where are my friends i asked silver answered in a smooth voice yesterday morning doctor livesey came down with a white flag cap n silver he said you ve lost the ship s gone we looked out and by thunder the ship had gone let s bargain said the doctor so we bargained and here we are in the house and your friends they walked off and i don t know where they are and now are you going to join us jim you re in trouble i said ship lost treasure lost men lost and if you want to know who did it it was me i was in the apple barrel the night we saw the island and i heard every word you said and the ship it was me who cut her ropes and killed the men aboard her and it s me who has sailed her to a place where you ll never find her kill me if you like but if you let me live i ll do what i can to save you when you re arrested and brought to trial for piracy one man swore and jumped forward with his knife get back there cried silver did you think you were cap n here tom morgan well there s never been a man to stand against me and see another day angry whispers came from the other men did any of you gentlemen want to argue with me shouted silver well i m ready let him take a knife and i ll see the colour of his inside not a man answered i listened to my heart beating silver waited calmly his pipe in his mouth as he watched his followers slowly they got together at the far end of the house and whispered to each other you seem to have a lot to say said silver let me hear it or stop talking we ll go outside and talk replied one man and he stepped calmly towards the door and disappeared out of the house one after another the rest of the men did the same they re going to kill you jim said silver when the two of us were alone and they re going to stop me being their captain when i looked into that bay and saw the ship was gone i knew it was all over now i ll save your life if i can but it must be a bargain you must save long john from dying under the law i ll do what i can i told him there s trouble coming jim he said and talking of trouble why did the doctor give me the map i stared at him in great surprise why indeed well he did silver went on and that s strange the door opened and the five pirates came in they pushed one man forward and he gave something to silver the sea cook looked at what the man had given him the black spot he said he turned the paper over what s this no longer captain you re becoming quite a leading man in this crew george merry you ll be cap n next i suppose but tell me what s wrong i ll tell you what s wrong said george first you made too many mistakes on this trip second you let the enemy out of this trap for nothing and then there s this boy is that all asked silver quietly it s enough replied george well i ll answer you said silver you all know what i wanted but you wouldn t listen would you in my plan we d be on the hispaniola now every dead man alive and the treasure on ship by thunder next this boy well we ll use him to bargain with he might be our last chance and the doctor you ve been glad enough to have a doctor coming to see you every day you john with your head broken or you george sick and shaking with fever only a few hours ago i made a bargain that s why i let em go he threw a piece of paper on to the floor it was the map with the three crosses the pirates jumped on it like cats upon a mouse very pretty said george but how are we going to get away with the treasure when we have no ship you tell me george shouted silver you and the others lost the ship i found the treasure but i ll not be your captain any longer silver for cap n shouted the pirates after a moment the sea cook smiled george he said i think you ll have to wait a while before you get another chance to be captain early in the morning dr livesey came to the stockade we ve a surprise for you doctor silver called out we ve a little stranger here the doctor was now inside the stockade not jim the very same jim said silver the doctor stopped well well he said then he went on let s see these sick men of yours silver a moment afterwards he entered the house with one look at me he went to his work among the sick well that s done he said after visiting each man and now i d like to talk to that boy please no cried george merry silence shouted silver hawkins he went on in his usual voice will you promise not to escape i gave the promise then doctor said silver you just step outside that stockade and when you re there i ll bring the boy down on the inside you can talk through the fence the men s anger exploded after the doctor left the house and they accused silver of trying to make a separate peace for himself silver waved the map in front of them and told them they were stupid by thunder he cried we ll break the peace when the right time comes and that s not now and then he walked out on his crutch his hand on my shoulder slowly boy he whispered to me we don t want to worry them dr livesey was waiting outside the stockade the boy will tell you how i saved his life silver said through the fence will you say a good word for me you re not afraid john are you asked dr livesey i don t like the idea of dying by the law said silver and now i ll leave you and jim alone so jim said the doctor here you are i m disappointed in you you went away when captain smollett was wounded which wasn t a brave thing to do doctor i cried i ve blamed myself enough jim said the doctor his voice changed jim i can t have this jump over and we ll run no i said i promised silver i wouldn t escape and i must go back but listen i took the ship and she s in north inlet on the beach the ship cried the doctor i told him my story and he listened in silence then he said it s you that saves our lives jim and now we ll save yours silver he called then as the cook came nearer said some advice don t hurry to find that treasure if you do watch out for storms what s the game doctor said silver why did you give me the map i can t say more said the doctor it s not my secret to tell but if we both get out of this alive silver i ll do my best to save you now keep the boy close beside you and when you need help shout for it then dr livesey hurried off into the wood looking for the treasure we went back to eat our breakfast they have the ship silver told the men and i don t know where it is but once we have the treasure we ll find it soon enough i ll keep the boy close by me when we look for the treasure then when we have both ship and treasure we ll persuade jim to join us and give him some of the treasure for all his help the men were happy but i was afraid if silver s plan came true he would forget dr livesey and the others i was sure and if things went wrong how could a boy and a one legged man fight five strong men when we left the stockade everyone had weapons except me silver had two guns and the parrot captain flint sat on his shoulder there was a rope around me and i followed after silver who held the other end some of the men carried spades others food and rum and we made our way to the beach where the two boats were waiting the men talked about the map the cross was too large to be of much help and the words on the back of the map were no better tall tree spyglass shoulder to the north of north north east skeleton island east south east and by east we landed the boats at the mouth of the second river then began to climb spyglass hill silver and i followed a long way behind the rest and i had to help him we were near the top when a man on the left cried aloud the others started to run towards him he can t have found the treasure said morgan and indeed it was something very different the bones of a human skeleton a few pieces of clothing still on it cold fear filled every heart he was a seaman said george merry yes agreed silver but look at the way those bones are lying it isn t natural the man lay perfectly straight his feet pointing one way his hands over his head pointing the opposite way i ve got an idea said silver look we can see the top of skeleton island from here these bones are a pointer telling us which way to go he was right our compass showed that the body pointed straight towards skeleton island and in a line east south east and by east we left the skeleton behind but now the pirates kept together and talked in frightened whispers at the top of the hill silver took out his compass again there are three tall trees he said in about the right place spyglass shoulder must be that lower place there a child could find the treasure now suddenly out of the middle of the trees in front of us a high shaking voice began to sing fifteen men on the dead man s chest yo ho ho and a bottle of rum the effect on the pirates was terrible to see the colour went from their six faces and they caught hold of each other like frightened children morgan fell to the ground trembling with fear it s flint cried george merry no said silver fighting to get the word out it s someone playing games it s no ghost then the voice came again darby m graw it screamed darby m graw fetch the rum the pirates were fixed to the ground after the voice died away their staring eyes full of horror that does it said one let s go those were flint s last words before he died cried morgan i m here to get that treasure shouted silver and i ll not be beaten by man or ghost i was never afraid of flint in his life and by thunder i ll face him dead there s seven hundred thousand pounds not a quarter of a mile from here i ll not leave that much money for a drunken old seaman him dead too and there s something strange there was an echo and no man ever saw a ghost with a shadow so why should a ghost s voice have an echo it s not natural the words calmed george merry yes that s right he said now i think about it it was like flint s voice but not exactly like it it was like another person s voice more like ben gunn shouted silver if it was it s still a ghost said dick ben gunn s not here in body any more than flint is but the older men laughed nobody minds ben gunn dead or alive cried george the men were happy again the colour back in their faces as they talked together and began to walk on george merry went first leading the way with silver s compass we reached the first tall tree but it was the wrong one so was the second the third was tall enough to be seen from the sea both east and west of the island my companions hurried on desperate to get their hands on the seven hundred thousand pounds in gold which lay somewhere under the tree s shadows silver pulled at the rope that held me and turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look i could read his thoughts so near to the gold now everything was forgotten his promise and the doctor s warning i knew he hoped to take the treasure cut every honest throat on that island find and board the hispaniola at night and sail away a rich man and a murderer suddenly george merry shouted all together boys and the men began to run not ten metres farther on they stopped and cried out silver moved quickly and the next moment we were with them before us was a large hole but it was not a new hole because grass grew on the bottom there was no treasure the seven hundred thousand pounds had gone end of an adventure the pirates could not believe it but silver remained calm and changed his plan quickly jim he whispered take that and be ready for trouble and he passed me a pistol at the same time he began to move quietly and after a few steps the hole was between us and the other five he looked quite friendly now and i couldn t help whispering so you ve changed sides again the pirates began to jump into the hole and to dig in the ground with their fingers morgan found a two guinea coin and it went from hand to hand two guineas shouted george merry shaking it at silver that s your seven hundred thousand pounds you re the man for bargains are you you re the one who never made a mistake wanting to be captain again george said silver but this time everyone was on george merry s side and they began to climb out of the hole there s just the two of them said george the old one legged man who brought us all here for nothing and that boy who i m going to have the heart of he was raising his arm and his voice ready to lead them but there was a sudden crack crack crack as three gunshots came from the woods george merry fell head first in to the hole and another fell on his side dead the other three turned and ran a moment later dr livesey gray and ben gunn joined us with smoking guns from among the trees keep them off the boats cried the doctor we began to run at a great speed through the trees and silver was soon thirty metres behind us doctor he shouted there s no hurry look we saw he was right in a more open place we could see the three pirates still running and we were already between them and the boats so we sat down to rest while long john came slowly up to us thank you doctor he said you came at the right time to save me and hawkins he looked at ben gunn so it was you ben gunn playing the ghost we walked down the hill to the boats and as we did so the doctor told silver and me his story but it was really ben s story from beginning to end ben in his lonely walks around the island had found the skeleton and found the treasure he had carried the gold on his back in many journeys and had taken it to a cave on the north east corner of the island two months before the hispaniola arrived ben had told the doctor this and the next morning the doctor gave silver the map which was now useless and gave him the food at the stockade because there was plenty in ben gunn s cave that morning when the doctor saw i had to go with the pirates to find the treasure he had left the squire to look after the captain then took gray and ben gunn with him to be ready to help us i was lucky hawkins was with me said silver or old john would be dead by now for sure by this time we were at the boats the doctor smashed one with an axe and then we all got into the other and rowed to north inlet the hispaniola was moving by herself now the sea high enough to take her off the beach we went round to rum cove the nearest landing place for ben gunn s cave of treasure then gray left us there before rowing back to guard the ship for the night mr trelawney met us at the cave he didn t blame me for my desertion but he spoke differently to silver silver he said you re a scoundrel and a murderer but i m told that i must save you from the law thank you sir replied long john i don t want your thanks cried the squire we all entered the cave it was large and pleasant with fresh water coming from a place in the ground and a floor of sand captain smollett lay in front of a big fire and in a corner i saw coins and gold bars it was flint s treasure we had come so far to find this already it had cost the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola and how many others how many ships had gone to the bottom of the sea how many brave men had been murdered for this perhaps no man alive could tell next morning we moved all the gold to the beach then we took it by boat to the hispaniola it was a big job for so small a number of men the three pirates who were still on the island did not trouble us they were not going to fight any more and we decided we must leave them on the island we left powder food clothes and medicine for them then at last one sunny morning we sailed out of north inlet and towards the nearest port in spanish america before afternoon treasure island had disappeared from view and i had never felt happier to leave a place behind the sun was going down when we sailed into the port and the doctor and mr trelawney took me on shore when we came back ben gunn was waiting for us silver has gone he told us but not empty handed he s taken one of the bags of coins perhps worth three or four hundred guineas i think we were all pleased to lose the scoundrel at so small a price we found a crew for the ship at the port and then had a good voyage home only five of the men who had sailed from bristol with the hispaniola returned with her we all took a large piece of the treasure and some used it sensibly and some did not captain smollett no longer goes to sea gray saved his money and is now half owner and captain of a fine ship ben gunn got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks then he came begging and was given a job as a gatekeeper of silver we have heard no more that frightening seaman with one leg has gone out of my lift i will never return to treasure island but in my worst dreams i still hear the sharp high scream of captain flint the parrot pieces of eight pieces of eight txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com the mysterious door mr utterson the lawyer was a quiet serious man hewas shy with strangers and afraid of showing his feelings among friends however his eyes shone with kindnessand goodness and although this goodness never found itsway into his conversation it showed itself in his way of life he did not allow himself many enjoyable things in life he ateand drank simply and although he enjoyed the theatre hehad not been to a play for twenty years however he wasgentler towards other men s weaknesses and was alwaysready to help rather than blame them as a lawyer he was often the last good person that evil doers met on their way toprison or worse these people often carried with them memories of his politeness and fairness mr utterson s best friend was a distant cousin calledrichard enfield who was well known as a fun loving manabout town nobody could understand why they werefriends as they were different from each other in every way they often took long walks together however marchingthrough the streets of london in companionable silence one of these walks used to take them down a narrow sidestreet in a busy part of london it was a clean busy friendlystreet with bright little shops and shiny doorknockers nearthe end of this street however stood a dark mysterious windowless building the door had neither bell nor knockerand looked dusty and uncared for dirty children played fearlessly on the doorstep and nobody ever opened the door todrive them away one day as mr enfield and his friend passed the building mr enfield pointed to it have you ever noticed that place he asked it remindsme of a very strange story really said mr utterson tell me well began enfield i was coming home about threeo clock on a black winter morning when suddenly i saw twopeople the first was a short man who was walking along thestreet and the second was a little girl who was running as fastas she could well the two bumped into each other and thechild fell down then a terrible thing happened the mancalmly walked all over the child s body with his heavy boots and left her screaming on the ground it was an inhuman thingto do i ran after the man caught him and fetched him back there was already a small crowd around the screaming child the man was perfectly cool but he gave me a very evil look which made me feel sick in my stomach the child s familythen arrived and also a doctor the child had been sent tofetch the doctor for a sick neighbour and was on her wayhome again the child is more frightened than hurt said thedoctor and that you would think was the end of the story but you see i had taken a violent dislike to the short man so had the child s family that was only natural but the doctor who seemed a quiet kindly man was also looking at ourprisoner with murder in his eyes the doctor and i understood each other perfectly together we shouted at the man and told him we would tell this story all over london so that his name would be hated he looked back at us with a proud blach look nameyour price he said we made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child sfamily with another black look the man led us to that doorover there he took out a key and let himself into thebuilding presently he came out and handed us ten pounds ingold and a cheque for ninety pounds from coutts s bank thename on the cheque was a well known one see here said the doctor doubtfully it isn t usual for aman to walk into an empty house at four in the morning andcome out with another man s cheque for nearly a hundredpounds don t worry said the man with an ugly look i ll staywith you until the banks open and change the chequemyself so we all went off the doctor and the prisoner and myself and spent the rest of the night at my house in the morningwe went together to the bank sure enough the cheque wasgood and the money was passed to the child s family well well said mr utterson yes said enfield it s a strange story my prisoner wasclearly a hard cruel man but the man whose name was onthe cheque was well known all over london for his kind andgenerous acts why would a man like that give his cheque to acriminal and you don t know if the writer of the cheque lives inthat building asked mr utterson i don t like to ask said his friend in my experience it s not a good idea to ask too many questions in case the answers are ugly violent ones but i ve studied the place alittle it doesn t seem like a house there s no other door and the only person who uses that door is the man i ve just described to you there are three windows on the side of thehouse which look down onto a small courtyard the windowsare shut but they re always clean there s a chimney too which is usually smoking so somebody must live there the two men continued on their walk then utterson brokethe silence enfield he said you re right about not asking toomany questions however i want to ask the name of the manwho walked over the child very well said enfield he told us his name washyde what does he look like he s not easy to describe although i remember him perfectly he s a strange looking man he s short but has astrong heavy body there s something wrong with his appearance something ugly and unpleasing no somethinghateful i disliked him at once mr utterson thought deeply are you sure he used a key he asked what do you mean asked enfield in surprise i know it must seem strange said his friend but yousee if i don t ask you the name on the cheque it s because iknow it already well why didn t you tell me said his friend rathercrossly anyway he did have a key and he still has it isaw him use it only a week ago mr utterson looked at him thoughtfully but said nothingmore in search of mr hyde after dinner that evening mr utterson went into his office and unlocked a cupboard he took out an envelope it contained the will of doctor henry jekyll and was writtenin the doctor s own handwriting if i die or if i disappear for more than three months thewill began i wish to leave everything i own to my dearfriend edward hyde this will had both worried and annoyed mr utterson to alawyer it was an unusual and dangerous kind of will it wasbad enough when edward hyde was only an unknown name but now that the lawyer knew something about hyde the willworried him more than ever it had seemed like madness before now it began to seem shameful with a heavy heart mrutterson replaced the envelope in the cupboard put on hiscoat and went to see his old friend doctor lanyon doctor lanyon was enjoying his after dinner coffee comein old friend he cried the two men had known each othersince their school days they sat for several minutes drinkingcoffee and talking companionably of this and that at last mrutterson mentioned the thoughts that were worrying him i suppose lanyon he said that you and i are henryjekyll s oldest friends i suppose so said doctor lanyon but i don t often seehim now really said mr utterson in surprise i thought you andhe were interested in the same things we were at one time said doctor lanyon but morethan ten years ago henry jekyll became too well imaginativefor me he developed some strange wild unscientific ideas itold him so and i ve seen very little of him since then mr utterson looked at his friend s red angry face only adisagreement about some scientific question he thought it s nothing worse than that calmly he continued didyou ever meet a friend of jekyll s a man called hyde hyde repeated lanyon no never soon the lawyer said goodnight and went home to bed where he lay awake for a long time thinking about enfield s description of hyde and doctor jekyll s will when at last hefell asleep he was troubled by dreams in his mind s eye hesaw a faceless man marching over the child s body then hesaw his old friend jekyll in bed while the same faceless figurestood over him the facelessness of that figure worried himdeeply very well mr hyde said the lawyer to himself i willfind you and i will see your face for myself during the next few weeks mr utterson spent many hoursin the narrow street where enfield had seen hyde he waitedpatiently near the mysterious door hoping for a sight of mrhyde and one dry clear winter night he was successful the street was empty and silent and small sounds carried along way the lawyer heard footsteps he stepped back intothe shadows and waited a short figure turned the corner andwalked towards the mysterious door although mr uttersoncould not see his face he felt a strong almost violent dislikefor the stranger mr utterson stepped forward and touched him on the shoulder mr hyde yes that s my name said the stranger coolly what doyou want i see that you re going in i m an old friend of doctorjekyll s my name is utterson you must have heard myname may i come in with you doctor jekyll is not at home replied mr hyde how didyou know me he added sharply first let me see your face replied the lawyer mr hyde hesitated for a moment then he stood under thestreet light and the lawyer saw his face thank you saidmr utterson now i shall know you again it may beuseful yes said mr hyde it may indeed be useful here too is my address you may need it one day he gave the lawyerhis address which was in a poor part of london good god thought the lawyer does hyde know aboutjekyll s will is that what he s thinking of but he saidnothing and now said mr hyde how did you know me you were described to me who did that i know people who know you who asked mr hyde sharply doctor jekyll for example said the lawyer he never told you cried mr hyde in sudden anger don t lie to me and before the lawyer could answer heturned the key in the lock and disappeared into the house mr utterson stared at the closed door why do i dislikehim so much he said to himself enfield was right thereis something evil about the man poor henry jekyll i m worried about you your new friend will mean trouble for you round the corner from the narrow street there was a squareof handsome old houses one of these was doctor jekyll s house and mr utterson knocked at the front door the servant answered and told him that doctor jekyll was not athome i saw mr hyde go in by the laboratory door in the street atthe back of the house said the lawyer that s right mr utterson replied the servant mrhyde has his own key and comes and goes when he likes wehave orders from doctor jekyll to obey him

nearly a year later a servant girlwas sitting at her bedroom window looking out at themoonlit street she saw a tall handsome old man with whitehair coming along the street and a shorter younger manwalkingtowardshim the old man spoke politely to theyounger one he seemed the girl said later to be asking hisway then the girl looked more closely at the younger manand recognized him it was mr hyde she said later he once visited my master mr hyde the girl said was carrying a heavy stick he wasplaying with it impatiently as he listened to the old man thensuddenly he seemed to explode with anger he was like a madman the servant girl said he shookhis stick at the old man who stepped back in surprise thenhe hit the old man violently with the stick and knocked him tothe ground he beat the helpless body again and again i couldhear the bones breaking it was so terrible that i began tofeel ill then everything went black and i don t remember anymore it was two o clock in the morning before she was consciousagain and able to call the police the murderer had disappeared but the dead man was still lying on the ground withthe murder weapon beside him the stick had broken in themiddle and one half still lay beside the murdered man thepolice decided that the murderer had carried away the otherhalf a gold watch and a purse were found in the dead man spockets but no cards or papersexcept a letter addressed tomr utterson a policeman brought this letter to the lawyer the nextmorning together they drove to the police station where thebody had been taken a police inspector showed him the body yes i recognize him said mr utterson heavily he issir danvers carew thank you sir said the inspector and do you recognizethis he showed mr utterson the broken stick and told himthe servant girl s story mr utterson knew the stick at once that s henryjekyll s stick he said to himself i gave it to him long ago is this hyde a short evil looking man he asked that s how the servant girl described him sir agreed theinspector come with me said mr utterson to the inspector ithink i know where he lives mr utterson led him to the address on mr hyde s visitingcard it was in a poor part of london in a dirty street full ofcheap bars and eating houses this was the home of henryjekyll s favourite friend the man who would inherit jekyll squarter of a million pounds an old servant opened the door under her silvery hair wasa smooth face with a false smile and evil eyes but she was polite enough yes she said mr hyde lives here but he s not athome my master came in very late last night he left againafter only an hour was that unusual asked the inspector not at all replied the servant he s often away andfrequently stays away for months at a time we would like to see his flat said mr utterson oh i can t do that sir began the servant this gentleman is a police inspector said mr utterson ah said the servant looking unnaturally pleased aboutit mr hyde s in trouble what s he done mr utterson and the inspector looked at each other hedoesn t seem a very popular person said the inspector heturned to the servant now please let us in and we ll have alook around mr hyde had only two rooms in the house these were extremely comfortable and in excellent taste with beautiful pictures on the walls and rich carpets on the floor everythingwas wildly untidy however and the fireplace was full of halfburnt papers among these the detective found part of acheque book he also found the other half of the murderweapon excellent he said now let s visit the bank and see ifthey recognize this cheque book sure enough the bank held several thousand pounds in anaccount in the name of edward hyde we ve got him now sir said the inspector we ve gotthe murder weapon and we ve got his cheque book now weonly need his description on the wanted notices this was not so easy there were no photographs of thewanted man and no two people could agree about his appearance they all agreed on one thing however an evil man sir the servant girl said you could see it in his face doctor jekyll receives a letter later that same afternoon mr utterson found his way todoctor jekyll s house jekyll s servant poole let himin at once and took him through the kitchen and across theback garden to the laboratory behind the house it was thefirst time that mr utterson had seen his friend s laboratory and he looked around curiously the old servant led mr utterson through the laboratory andup some stairs to the doctor s private study above this was alarge room with tall glass fronted cupboards a large mirrorand a big businesslike table a good fire burned in the fireplace and beside it sat doctor jekyll looking white and ill ina thin tired voice he welcomed his friend have you heard the news said mr utterson after the oldservant had left the newsboys were shouting about it in the street doctorjekyll said a terrible business let me ask you something said the lawyer sir danverscarew was my client but you are my client too and i want toknow what i m doing you haven t tried to hide the murderer have you utterson i promise you cried the doctor i promise youi ll never see him again i ve finished with him for ever andnow indeed he no longer needs my help you don t knowhim like i do he s safe quite safe believe me nobody willever hear of hyde again the lawyer listened with a serious face he did not like hisfriend s feverish excited look you seem very sure of him he replied i hope you reright if he is caught and comes to trial your name may bementioned i m absolutely sure of him answered jekyll i can t tellyou how i know but i m certain but can you please adviseme about one thing i ve received a letter and i don t knowwhether to show it to the police may i leave it in your hands utterson you re afraid i suppose that the letter will lead the police to hyde asked the lawyer no said doctor jekyll i don t care what happens tohyde i was thinking of my own reputation anyway here is the letter it was written in a strange pointed handwriting and signed edward hyde i am sorry that i have been so ungrateful inthe past for your many generous acts it began please don t worry about me i am quite safe and i am certain that i can escape unharmed whenever i wish did this letter come by post asked the lawyer no replied doctor jekyll there was no postmark on theenvelope the letter came by hand shall i keep the letter and think about it asked mr utterson i want you to decide for me answered his client i mnot sure of anything any more very well said the lawyer now tell me the part inyour will about disappearing for three months or more wasthat hyde s idea it was whispered doctor jekyll he was planning to murder you said the lawyer you ve had a lucky escape i ve had a lesson too said his client in pain and sadness oh what a lesson and he covered his face with his hands on his way ont of the house the lawyer stopped and spoketo poole by the way he said a letter was handed in today foryour master who brought it and what did he look like nobody came except the postman sir said the servant insurprise that worries me thought mr utterson as he walkedhome clearly the letter arrived by the laboratory door perhaps it was even written in the study i must think about thiscarefully in the street the newsboys were still shouting read allabout it terrible murder the lawyer s thoughts were sad one of his clients wasdead and the life and reputation of another were in danger mr utterson did not usually ask anyone for advice today however was different that evening he sat by his fireside with his chief clerk mrguest beside him the lawyer and his clerk had worked together for many years and knew and understood each other also mr guest had been involved in business with doctorjekyll and knew him well outside it was foggy and dark but the room was bright andwarm and there was a bottle of good whisky on the table this is a sad business about sir danvers carew said mrutterson yes indeed sir the murderer was a madman of course i would like your opinion about that replied the lawyer i have a letter from the murderer here mr guest was interested in the study of handwriting hiseyes brightened at once a murderer s letter he said that will be interesting he looked carefully at the writing not a madman i think he said but what unusual handwriting just then a servant entered with a note is that note from doctor jekyll asked mr guest ithought i recognized the handwriting is it anything private mr utterson only an invitation to dinner why do you want to seethe letter just for a moment please sir the clerk put the two letters side by side and studied them carefully thank you sir he said very interesting for a moment mr utterson hesitated wondering and worrying at last he put his thoughts into words why did youlook at the two letters together he asked well sir in many ways the two are surprisingly similar how strange mr guest i must ask you not to speakof this business to anyone of course not sir said the clerk you can depend onme shortly afterwards he said good night to his master andmade his way home when he was alone mr utterson locked the two letters inhis cupboard well he thought so henry jekyll wrotethat letter for a murderer his face was as calm and expressionless as usual but his heart was filled with fear for his oldfriend the death of a friend time passed the search for mr hyde continued sirdanvers carew was an important and popular man andthe police tried desperately to arrest the murderer and bringhim to trial but there was no sign of mr hyde himself although the police and the newspapers discovered a lot about hispast life nobody it seemed could say one good word aboutthe wanted man he was a cruel violent man who had livedan evil life full of hate and jealousy none of this however was any help to the police mr hyde had just disappeared as time went by mr utterson became calmer and more atpeace with himself he was truly sorry that his client sirdanvers carew was dead but he was also very glad that mrhyde had disappeared as for doctor jekyll he too appearedcalmer and happier he came out into the world again he invited friends to his house and accepted invitations to theirs hehad always been a good and generous man now however hebecame a churchgoer too he was busy he spent a lot of timein the fresh air and he looked happy and carefree for morethan two months he was at peace with himself and the world on the th of january mr utterson was invited to dinner atdoctor jekyll s house doctor lanyon was there too this isquite like old times thought the lawyer as he watched doctorjekyll smiling at doctor lanyon on january th however and again on the th doctorjekyll refused to see visitors the doctor is not well explained poole he hopes youwill forgive him but he cannot see anyone mr utterson called again next day and again the day afterthat after two months of almost daily meetings with his oldfriend the lawyer felt rather lonely on the sixth evening heinvited his clerk mr guest to dinner with him and on theseventh night he went to visit doctor lanyon doctor lanyon made him welcome but mr utterson wasshocked by the change in the doctor s appearance his face which was usually pink and healthy was grey and thin andthere was a frightened look in his eyes he was suddenly anold sick man he looks said mr utterson to himself like a man whoknows he s dying how are you lanyon he said you don t look well i ve had a shock utterson replied doctor lanyon andit will cause my death i have only a few weeks to live hepaused well it comes to us all sooner or later i ve had agood life on the whole jekyll is ill too said the lawyer have you seen him at the name of jekyll the look on doctor lanyon s face changed please he said holding up a trembling hand don t speak that name in this house oh dear said mr utterson he hesitated for a moment the three of us have been friends all our lives lanyon weare too old now to make new friends can t you forgive andforget perhaps i can help nothing can be done replied doctor lanyon ask himyourself he won t let me into the house that doesn t surprise me one day utterson after i amdead you will perhaps learn the full story meanwhile if youcan sit and talk to me of other things please stay just don t mention that person as it hurts me to think about him as soon as he got home mr utterson wrote to doctorjekyll in his letter he asked why jekyll refused to let him intohis house and why he and doctor lanyon were no longerfriendly the reply was long and not always easy to understand i m not angry with our old friend doctor jekyll wrote but i agree with him that the two of us must never meetagain meanwhile you must forgive me if from now on i livea very quiet life if you find my door closed to you it s because i must travel this dark dangerous road alone i havedone wrong and i m being punished for it and nobody canhelp me what is this thought mr utterson hyde has disappeared jekyll is his normal self again at least he was untillast week has he gone mad then he remembered doctorlanyon s words there is something more he said to himself something mysterious but i have no idea what it is a week later doctor lanyon was too ill to leave his bed two weeks after that he was dead after his friend s burial mr utterson went home and into his office from his lockedcupboard he took out an envelope which he had received soonafter his friend s death in doctor lanyon s handwriting he read g j utterson private the lawyer turned the envelope over and over in hishands before he opened it what terrible news could itcontain with trembling hands mr utterson opened the envelope inside was another envelope with the words not to beopened until the death or disappearance of doctor henryjekyll the lawyer could not believe his eyes death or disappearance the words were the same as in doctor jekyll s will iunderstand why jekyll wrote those words said mr uttersonto himself but why did lanyon write them too for a moment he wanted to open the envelope and uncover the mysterythere and then but mr utterson was too honest a man and alawyer to do that he knew he must obey his friend s andclient s last wish he locked the envelope away in his cupboard beside doctor jekyll s will the lawyer was desperately worried about his friend doctorjekyll he was afraid for him too he called at the house butthe doctor always refused to see him how is he poole mr utterson asked the old servant oneday not very well sir he spends all his time in the studyabove his laboratory he sleeps there as well he seems verysilent and uneasy something is worrying him sir but hewon t tell anyone for a long time the lawyer called almost every day little bylittle however he became tired of his friend s refusal to seehim and his visits became less frequent the face at the window one sunday soon afterwards mr utterson was walkingwith his friend enfield when they happened to passthrough the narrow side street again enfleld pointed to themysterious door well he said that story is finished we shall never seemr hyde again i hope you re right said the lawyer did i tell you ionce saw hyde too and had the same strong feelings of dislikefor him as you did what an evil man i agree said his friend by the way why didn t you tellme that our mysterious door led to the laboratory at the back ofdoctor jekyll s house i didn t know then but i know now well now that you know let s go into the courtyard andlook up at his window i must tell you i m worried aboutpoor jekyll perhaps the sight of a friendly face will do himgood overhead the evening sky was bright but the courtyard wascool and dark at an open window of the study above the laboratory doctor jekyll sat like a prisoner staring at the worldoutside i hope you are better jekyll the lawyer called up to him the doctor shook his head sadly i m not well utterson he said i shall not be here much longer thankgod you spend too much time indoors you ought to get outinto the fresh air like enfield and me by the way this ismy cousin mr enfield come now get your hat and join usfor a quick walk you re very kind said the doctor but no it s quiteimpossible i would like to invite you and mr enfield inside but the place is not very tidy well then said the lawyer gently we can talk to youfrom here that s an excellent idea began the doctor with asmile but suddenly the smile left his face and was replaced byan expression of hopelessness fear and horror the two menbelow saw it but only for a second as the window was shutwith a bang the two men looked at each other then turnedand left the courtyard without a word in silence they crossedthe narrow side street they did not speak until they came outinto a busy noisy street then mr utterson at last turned andlooked at his companion whose face was as pale as his own the expression on doctor jekyll s face had upset them bothdeeply god help him whispered mr utterson god help thepoor man but mr enfield only nodded his head very seriously andwalked on without a word the last night it was now march and mr utterson was sitting by thefire after dinner when he was surprised to receive avisitfrom doctor jekyll s servant poole the old man looked paleand frightened mr utterson he said something is wrong sit down by the fire and tell me all abut it the doctor s locked himself up in his study sir that s quite usual surely said the lawyer you knowyour master s habits as well as i do he often shuts himselfaway from the world yes but this time it s different it frightens me siri ve been frightened for more than a week now and i justcan t go on any longer he stopped and stared down at the floor try and tell me poole said mr utterson gently something terrible is happening to my master i can t explain but please sir can you come with me and see foryourself at once mr utterson fetched his coat and hat thank you sir whispered poole gratefully together they made their way to doctor jekyll s house itwas a wild stormy night to mr utterson the streets seemedstrangely empty and lonely the square when they reachedit was full of wind and flying dust the thin trees were blowing wildly and untidy grey clouds were sailing past a pale sickly moon well sir said poole here we are and i hope that nothing is wrong he knocked softly at the front door the doorwas opened just a little and a voice from inside asked is thatyou poole yes open the door the hall when they entered was brightly lit a good firewas burning the room was full of people every servant inthe house was there they looked like a crowd of frightenedchildren what s all this said the lawyer what are you all doinghere your master would not be pleased they re frightened said poole simply no one elsespoke a little servant girl began to cry quiet said poole sharply trying to control his own fear now fetch me a light and we ll finish this business at once mr utterson sir please follow me he led the way across theback garden towards the laboratory come as quietly as you can sir i want you to hear but idon t want him to hear you and sin if he asks you to go inside don t go mr utterson s heart gave a little jump of fear but hebravely followed the servant into the laboratory to the bottomof the stairs wait here sir and listen carefully whispered poole hehimself again controlling his fear climbed the stairs andknocked on the study door mr utterson would like to see you sir he called tell him i cannot see anyone said a voice from inside thestudy thank you sir said poole he led mr utterson backacross the garden and into the house sir he said was thatmy master s voice the lawyer s face was pale it has changed he said changed you re right said poole i ve worked fordoctof jekyll for twenty years that was not my master s voice someone has murdered my master eight days ago weheard his voice for the last time dear god he cried thenno more the voice you heard just now was the voice of hismuderer this is an extraordinary story my good man said mr utterson he tried hard to appear calm if dr jekyll has beenmurdered why is his murderer still there what reason couldhe possibly have for staying perhaps you don t believe me sir but i know what iheard for a week now the person or thing in that studyhas been crying night and day for some special chemical powders my master was in the habit when he was particularlybusy with his scientific work of writing orders on pieces ofpaper and leaving them on the stairs we ve had nothing elsethis week nothing except written orders and a locked door i ve been to every chemist in town in search of these chemicalsof his but they were never right they weren t pure enough he said i had to take them back to the shop and try anotherchemist i don t know what these chemicals are but the person in that study wants them terribly badly did you keep any of these written orders asked mr utterson poole reached in his pocket and brought out a note thelawyer read it carefully it said i am returning your chemicals as they are impure and therefore useless in the year you made up a mixture of chemical powders for doctorhenry jekyll please search your cupboards for some more ofthe same mixture and send it to doctor jekyll at once thisis very important this is a strange note said mr utterson the chemist thought so too sir said poole when i tookhim this note he cried all my chemicals are pure and youcan tell your master so and he threw the note back at me are you sure this is your master s handwriting asked mrutterson of course sir said poole but what does handwritingmatter i ve seen my master s murderer seen him repeated mr utterson yes it was like this i came suddenly into the laboratoryfrom the garden i think he had left the study to look forsomething the study door was open and there he was at thefar end of the laboratory he was searching among some oldboxes he looked up when i came in gave a kind of cry andran upstairs and into the study i only saw him for a moment but my blood seemed to freeze sir if that was my master why was he wearing a mask over his face if it was my master why did he cry out like a trapped animal and run awayfrom me i ve been his servant for twenty years and then poole paused and covered his face with his hands tooupset to speak this is all very mysterious said mr utterson but i thinki begin to understand your master poole is ill and the illness has changed his appearance perhaps that also explainsthe change in his voice it certainly explains the mask and theway he has been avoiding his friends and of course he s searching for these chemicals he cause he believes they willmake him well again dear god i hope he s right poorjekyll thst is my explanation it s sad enough poole butit s normal and natural and there s nothing to be alarmedabout sir said the servant that thing was not my master my master is a tall fine well built man the stranger wasmuch shorter sir i have been with my master for twentyyears and i know his appearance as well as i know my own no sir that thing in the mask was never doctor jekyll and ibelieve that he it murdered my master poole said the lawyer if you say that i must makesure we must break down the study door you re right mr utterson cried the old servant very well will you help me if we are wrong i ll makesure that you re not blamed for it there s an axe in the laboratory suggested poole you realize poole said mr utterson that this may bedangerous for us both let us now be honest with each other this masked figure that you saw you re certain that it wasnot your master that s right sir did you in fact recognize it well sir it was all so quick that i m not really sure but well i think it was mr hyde it was short like mrhyde and it moved in the same light quick active way andwho else could come in by the laboratory door from the street you must remember sir that at the time of the carew murder mr hyde still had the laboratory key with him but that s not all mr utterson did you ever meet mr hyde yes replied the lawyer i once spoke with him then you will know sir that there is something strangeabout mr hyde something evil i agree with you said mr utterson i felt something likethst too yes sir well when that thing in the mask jumped outfrom behind the boxes and ran up the stairs i had exactly thesame feeling that thing behind the mask was mr hydee i understand poole and i believe you said the lawyerslowly and i believe poor henry jekyll has been murdered i believe too that his murderer is still hiding in the study now poole let s go and make an end of it together they went out into the back garden the cloudshad covered the moon and it was now quite dark as theypassed silently by the wall of the laboratory they stopped andlistened further away they could hear the everyday noises of alondon evening from the study above them however camethe sound of footsteps moving backwards and forwards acrossthe floor it walks like that all day sir whisperedpoole yes andmost of the night too it only stops when some more chemicalsarrive from the chemist ah sir listen to that do you thinkthose are my master s footsteps the short light steps were indeed very different from henry jekyll s long heavy ones have you anything else to tell me poole asked thelawyer heavily once said poole i heard it weeping weeping repeated mr utterson in horror weeping like a lost child said the old servant it tore myheart i felt like weeping too well said the lawyer we have a job to do they went into the laboratory and climbed the stairs to thestudy jekyll called the lawyer in a loud voice i must seeyou he paused for a moment but there was no reply ifyou refuse to let me in then i ll break dowu the door utterson said a voice from inside the study i beg you toleave me alone that s not jekyll s voice shied mr utterson it s hyde s break the door down poole the axe rose and fell the door shook and a scream of purefear like a trapped animal rang from the study again theaxe crashed against the door but the wood was strong and thelock was well made at last however the door fell inwardsupon the carpet the two men stared into the study they saw a warm comfortable room with a good fire burning in the fireplace anda few papers on the big table a friendly homely room butface down in the middle of the floor there lay the body of aman the lawyer turned it over on its back and saw the face ofedward hyde he was dressed in clothes that were much toolarge for him and in his hand he held a small bottle the lawyer shook his head he s taken poison poole hesaid i fear we ve come too late to save doctor jekyll andtoo late to punish his murderer too now we must find yourmaster s body they searched everywhere but there was no sign of henryjekyll dead or alive perhaps your master has escaped said mr utterson hopefully he went to check the door from the laboratory into thenarrow side street it was locked and covered with dust onthe floor nearby he found a broken key it s a long time since anyone opened this door said mrutterson yes said poole picking up the broken key so how didhyde get in this is too difficult for me pooh said the lawyer let sgo back to the study they searched the study again look sir said poole pointing to a small bable in the corner there were bottles ofliquid and some white powders lying in saucers he was testing his chemicals here one of the doctor s books was lying on the floor its coverwas torn off the lawyer picked it up doctor jekyll loved hisbooks and always took great care of them but he had writtenall over this one the handwriting was unmistakable beforetearing it and throwing it on the floor then the lawyer noticed the tall mirror on the wall betweenthe glass fronted bookshelves how strange said mr utterson why did jekyll want amirror in his study next they turned to the desk and found a large packet addressed to mr utterson the handwriting was doctorjekyll s the lawyer opened the packet and three envelopesfell out on to the floor the first contained a will it was likedoctor jekyll s first win in every wayexcept one the doctor had left all his money not to edward hyde but to gabrieljohn utterson the lawyer looked at the will then at poole and finally atthe dead man on the floor i just don t understand he whispered hyde has beenhere all this time why didn t he destroy this will he picked up the next envelope it contained a short note inthe doctor s handwriting mr utterson saw the date poole he cried this is today s date on the letter jekyllwas alive here today he can t be dead he has run away or ishiding somewhere and if so why if he s alive can we besure that hyde killed himself we must be careful poole orwe may involve your master in some terrible danger why don t you read the note sir asked the servant because i m afraid said the lawyer in a worried voice slowly he lifted the letter and read my dear utterson if you are reading this it means that i have disappeared please go home and read lanyon s letter afterwards pleaseread the confessicn of your unfortunate and unhappy friend henry jekyll this must be the confession said mr utterson to himself picking up the third and largest envelope he put it in hispocket say nothing about these papers poole he said ifyour master has died or disappeared this paper may save hisreputation it s now ten o clock i must go home and studythese papers in peace and quiet but i shall come back here before midnight and then we shall send fof the police they went out locking the laboratory door behind them with a heavy heart mr utterson walked home to read his letters doctor lanyon s letter dear utterson four days ago on the th of january i received a letterby the evening post it was in the handwriting of my oldfriend henry jekyll i was rather surprised as we were not inthe habit of writing to each other and i had had dinner withhim the night before when i came to read the letter i waseven more surprised the letter said dear lanyon you are one of my oldest friends although we havesometimes disagreed on scientific matters i have alwaysremained your friend i would do anything for you lanyon please will you do something for me now please old friend come to my house at once wth thisletter in your hand poole my servant has his orders hewill be here with a locksmith break the lock of my studydoor and then you must go in there alone open the glassfronted cupboard on the left hand side and look on the fourthshelf from the top on it you will find some packets of chemical powders a small bottle and a book please take everything back to your house if you leave as soon as you receve this letter you shouldbe back home before midnight at that time you will recevea visit from a man please give him the bottle the powdersand the book and i shall aways be grateful to you do not fail me lanyon believe me my life and mypeace of mind depend on you i am in fearful danger and only you can save me your friend henry jekyll after reading this letter i was sure that doctor jekyll wasmad but a friend is a friend and so i went at once to hishouse jekyll s servant had received by the same post a letter similar to mine and he was waiting for me with the locksmith together we went through the old laboratory andclimbed the stairs to the doctor s private study the doorwas very strong with an excellent lock but the locksmithknew his job soon the door stood open and i entered thestudy i opened the cupboard and found the shelf sureenough the powders the bottle and the book were there and i took them home with me at home i lcoked at everything more carefully there wereseveral packets of white powder and a bottle of red strong smelling liquid the book contained nothing except alist of dates going back several years the last date wasnearly a year ago here and there the doctor had added afew words the word donble appeared very early in thelist followed by the word failed double appeared inthe list several more times what was jekyll doing thebook looked like a list of unsuccessful experiments howcould i by taking these things to my house save my friend s life and peace of mind and what was the reason for thismidnight visitor i put my old gun in my pocket then i putevery thing in a box for my midnight visitor to collect at midnight exactly there was a knock on my door a shortman was standing in the shadows are you from doctor jekyll i asked he bent his head although i could not see his face there was something unpleasing about him and i was glad i had a weapon i invitedhim into the house and there in the bright light i took a closer look at him his appearance was extremely strange his clothes werewell made and expensive but they were far too large forhim he looked like a child wearing his father s clothes butthere was nothing childlike about this man he was short asi have said but very strong at the same time there was alook of sickness and horror about him and his face was amask of pain violence and hate as a doctor i could pernapsfeel sorry for him as a mau i felt only fear and dislike you got it said the stranger impatiently reachingout his hand and touching my arm his touch made my bloodrun cold i shook off his hand come sir i said calmly sit down and introduce yourself i apologize doctor lanyon the stranger said more politely doctor henry jekyll sent me here on an importantmatter i have to collect something from you i gave him the box he took it with trembling hands atlast he cried he turned to me his face was deathly pale have you a medicine glass he asked i gave it to him he put a little of the red liquid in the glassand added a packet of powder a small cloud of smoke rosefrom the glass and the colour of the liquid changed from redto purple and from purple to a watery green the strangerput the glass down on the table and looked sharply at me and now he said choose carefully you can leave theroom now or you can stay and experience something new something unknown to science you can be rich famous andsuccessful if only you will believe sir i said trying to remain calm i don t understandwhat you re trying to say and i think you are probably madbut i will stay very well said the stranger now remember yourpromise you ve been an unbeliever all your life youlaughed at doctor jekyll s ideas and called them unscientificrubbish now see for yourself he put the glass to his lips and drank the liquid his wholebody shook and jumped and he almost fell he held onto theedge of the table breathing fast through his open mouth asi watched his whole body seemed to change he seemed tobecome taller fatter his face turned black and its shapebegan to change the next moment i jumped back againstthe wall trembling with fear and horror there before myeyes pale and shaken and sick stood henry jekyll i cannot make myself write down the things that jekyll with tears in his eyes confessed to me that night now fear and horror are my only companions sleep has left me and i feel that i have not long to live as i write iwonder did i imagine it all as a scientist i cannot believeit but i saw it happen with my own eyes i will say just one thing more utterson the evil thing thatcame into my house that night as jekyll told me wasknown by the name of hyde and was wanted by the policefor the murder of sir danvers carew hastie lanyon with fear in his heart mr utterson put away doctor lanyon s letter and then opened the confession of doctor henry jekyll doctor jekyll s confession i was born in the year i inherited a large fortune a strong healthy body and an excellent mind i wasnaturally hard working and soon i was extremely successful inmy chosen work as a scientist although i was still young important people came to me for advice at an age when mostyoung men are going out and having fun i was behaving like agrey haired old man this was not easy for me the outside world saw a serious hard working doctor behind this quiet character however was an active fun loving young man about town this ofcourse was nothing to be ashamed of but i did not realizethat at the time i was ashamed and i soon learned to keepmy two lives separate i was not dishonest in any way both these people were me the serious successful young doctor was me and the wild fun loving irresponsible young man was me too i thought about this for a long time and slowly i realized that i was notextraordinary in this every man has two sides to hischaracter he is two people they live together often uncomfortably in the same body how fantastic i thought if i could separate these twocharacters and give my fun loving side his freedom then hecould go out and enjoy himself unashamedly and leave serious studious doctor jekyll to get on with his important life savingwork was it possible i wondered to find a drug that couldgive each side of my characier its own separate face and body after much thought and careful study i believed i had foundthe answer i had read many scientific books and spent manyhours in my laboratory searching for the right mixture ofchemicals to make my drug at last i had everything i neededexcept a special kind of salt i bought some from a chemist and then i was ready i hesitated for a long time before i began my experiment only a small mistake in the mixture of the drug could meanimmediate death but in the end my wish to know wasstronger than my fear and so late one disastrous night imixed everything together and prepared my drug i watchedthe smoke rising from the liquid as it changed colour from redto purple and at last to green then bravely i drank everybitter drop i felt a violent sickness in my stomach and a terrible pain inall my bones the room seemed to turn round and round and itrembled with fear then the fear and pain disappeared and astrange sweet feeling took its place wild thoughts dancedthrough my mind they were not good serious thoughtsthey were the wild passions of an evil and cruel stranger butinside myself i felt younger lighter more carefree than everbefore if this is pure evil i thought i like it i stood there enjoying these strange new thoughts and passions and suddenly realized that i was shorter at that timethere was no mirror in my stidy later i put one on the wallof my study so that i could watch these changes in my appearance now however it was three o clock in the morning andall the servants were asleep i decided it was safe to go to mybedroom in my new body and take a look at myself in the mirror there i crossed the garden and entered my house like astranger as i came into my room i saw edward hyde forthe first time at that time the good side of my character was strongerthan the evil side henry jekyll had his faults but he wasmostly a good kind man i cannot be sure but i believe thatis the reason why edward hyde was so much smaller thanhenry jekyll but that was not the only difference betweenthe two men henry jekyll had a kind open honest face pure evil stared out of edward hyde s eyes i felt no dislike however indeed i welcomed him edward hyde was me young and strong and full of life later however i noticed that hyde s appearance andmanner had a strong effect on other people nobody couldmeet edward hyde without a feeling of dislike and horror ibelieve i understand the reason for this too everyone is a mixture of good and evil even the worst criminal has a little goodin him only edward hyde was pure evil i stood for a long time staring at the mirror am itrapped i wondered if i am i must leave this house beforedaylight if i don t i shall be arrested as a thief i hurried back to my study with trembling hands i mixedanother dose of the drug and drank it again i felt that terriblepain and sickness but a few seconds later i found myself withthe face and body and character of henry jekyll once more i blame myself for the things that happened later it wasnot the fault of the drug that was neither good nor evil butit opened the prison doors and all owed edward hyde toescape soon he was out of control he you will remember was wholly evil doctor jekyll was not wholly good however he was a normal man with normal faults and weaknesses andhyde was too strong for him i welcomed hyde therefore i arranged everything verycarefully i bought a flat in a poor part of london where ikept hyde s clothes and employed a servant to do the housework i took a dose of the drug whenever i wanted to forgetmy old quiet serious self for a time in those early daysgod forgive me i thought it was all very amusing doctorjekyll was well known nobody knew hyde however and inhis body i was free to do as i wished i will not go into details about my adventures and shamefulacts as hyde jekyll remained as good and kind as ever and always did his best to undo the harm that hyde did but as timewent by jekyll became less and less able to control hyde one night hyde injured a child in the street and a passer bysaw him that passer by was your cousin i recognized himwhen the two of you came to my window your cousin caughthyde and an angry crowd collected they asked for money forthe child s family in the end in order to escape hyde hadto give your cousin a cheque in the name of jekyll i learned my lesson from this and opened a new bank account in the name of hyde i even gave hyde a different handwriting i was sure i was safe but i was wrong two months before the murder of sir danvers carew i wentout on one of my evil adventures before i went to bed i tooka dose of the drug and became doctor jekyll once more iwoke up in bed the next morning with a strange feeling thatsomething was wrong i looked around the room thendown at my hand henry jekyll s hand was large white andwellmade but the hand i saw that morning on the bedcoverwas thin bony greyish brown and hairy it was the hand ofedward hyde sick with horror i stared at it i was henry jekyll when iwent to bed i thought and now i am edward hyde what possible explanation can there be and moreimportant how can i get to my study and take the drug then i realized that the servants were quite used to the comings and goings of hyde i put on hyde s clothes and marchedconfidently through the house poole stared in surprise to seemr hyde so early in the morning but i did not care tenminutes later doctor jekyll had returned to his own shape andwas sitting down pretending to eat breakfast too worried to eat i sat there thinking hard about my situation i realized that in recent weeks hyde had become biggerand stronger both in body and character what will i do i thought hyde takes control ithought about the drug once in the early days it had failedcompletely and sometimes i had had to take a double dose before i changed into hyde now however it was quite easy tobecome hyde the problem was to become jekyll again aftermy adventures my good self and my evil self were fighting formy mind and body and my evil self was winning i knew i had to choose between the two and i chose doctorjekyll perhaps i was not wholly serious about this however because i did not sell hyde s flat or destroy his clothes fortwo months i lived the life of a quiet and responsible man butsoon i began to miss hyde his strong young body his love oflife and his dark adventures in the narrow nameless streets oflondon one night when my life as jekyll seemed imposslblydull and boring i mixed a dose of the drug and drank it it was like opening the door of a cage and letting a wild animal escape that night i became a madman and beat sir danvers to death for no reason at all i felt only a wild delight asi hit his body again and again afterwards i ran to the flat anddestroyed all my papers i was not ashamed of my crime instead i was filled with a high sweet excitement i relived themurder as i walked back home through the streets i feltstrong and masterful edward hyde had a song on his lipsas he mixed a dose of the drug your very good health sirdanvers he laughed as he drank a moment of terrible pain then poor henry jekyll fell to his knees and begged god to forgive him when i was myself again i locked the door that led fromthe street to my laboratory i broke the key and threw itaway goodbye for ever mr hyde i whispered the next day the news of the murder was all over london the servant girl had seen the crime and recognized mr hyde my other self was wanted by the police in some ways i was glad now hyde could not show hisface to the world again if he did every honest man in london would be proud to report him to the police once again i led a busy responsible and almost happy life until one fine clear january day i was sitting on a seat inthe park enjoying the sunshine when suddenly i felt deathlysick i began to tremble all over soon however i felt wellagain not only well but young strong and fearless i lookeddown my clothes were suddenly too big the hand on my kneewas the bony hairy hand of edward hyde it was so sudden one moment i was a famous and popular doctor the next iwas a violent criminal who was wanted for murder how could i get to my study to take the drug i had lockedthe street door to my laboratory and broken the key i couldnot therefore enter from the street i could not go inthrough the house because of the servants i needed help fromoutside i thought of lanyon but how could i reach him and how could i persuade him to let hyde into his home how too could i persuade him to break into doctor jekyll s private study it looked impossible then i remembered my appearance was unrecognizable but my handwriting was unchanged i could still write a letterin doctor jekyll s name calling a passing taxicab i orderedthe driver to drive to a hotel quite near lanyon s house ofcourse jekyll s clothes were much too large for my body and ihad trouble in climbing into the cab the driver noticed mystrange appearance and could not help laughing i gave himsuch a black look however that the smile froze on his face in my desperate fear and danger i was like a pain maddened animal ready to kill or wound at any moment i wanted topull the driver from his seat and murder him then and there but i was clever too my life depended on my coolness and ifought to control my murderous passions we reached the hotel i paid the driver and went inside holding up my too large trousers the servants smiled whenthey saw my strange appearance i stared angrily at them andtheir smiles disappeared at once i gave my orders and they ledme to a private room and brought me some writing paper and apen hyde in danger of his life was a new experience for me he i write he because i find it hard to write i he wasnot human his only feelings at that time were fear and hate hyde was wholly evil but he was not stupid he knew thathis life depended on two letters one to lanyon and one topoole if he failed he would die carefully he wrote the letters and sent a servant to postthem after that he sat all day by the fire in the private room there too he had dinner brought by a frightened waiter atlast when darkness had covered the city he sat in the cornerof a closed taxicab just drive round he ordered and thedriver drove backwards and forwards through the streets oflondon then when hyde thought the driver was beginning to sus pect something he sent the taxicab away and continued onfoot he was a strange figure in his too large clothes withfear and hate staring out of his eyes he walked along talkingto himself once a woman spoke to him will you buy my matches sir she begged hyde hit heracross the face and she ran away in fear my plan was successful and when i arrived in lanyon s house i took the dose of the drug that returned me to my nor mal appearance immediately afterwards i felt deeply ashamed perhaps itwas lanyon s horror that made me feel like that i do notknow but i hated myself and i was conscious of an importantchange in my feelings i was no longer afraid of the police iwas afraid of hyde himself the thought of his short strong hairy body and his evil cruel wholly selfish mind filled mewith horror exhausted by the horrors of that day i slept heavily iwoke in the morning feeling weak and shaky but quitenormal i still hated and feared the thought of the wild animalinside me and i had not forgotten the desperate dangers of theday before but i was at home and close to my drugs and iwas most deeply grateful for my escape i was walking across the garden after breakfast enjoyingthe clear wintry air when suddenly my body was again tornby those indescribable feelings which i always experienced af ter a dose of the drug i only just reached my study before iwas again burning and freezing with the violent passions ofhyde with feverish speed i mixed the drug this time i hadto take a double dose to return to my old shape and then on ly six hours later the pains returned and i had to repeat thedose from that day onwards the situation worsened i neededlarger and more frequent doses in order to stay in jekyll s body the pains came unexpectedly but most of all when iwas asleep i was afraid to go to bed or even to sleep for afew moments in my chair if i did so i always woke as hyde soon jekyll was a sick man feverish and weakened by painand fear as jekyll grew weaker hyde became stronger thanever he burned with hate for everybody and everything andhyde and jekyll now hated each other with equal passion jekyll hated hyde because hyde was evil and inhuman andbecause hyde was stronger than he was jekyll lived in fear ofwaking up and finding himself in hyde s body with allhyde s evil passions hyde hated jekyll for a different reason his fear of death the punishment for murder drove him tothe hiding place of jekyll s body but he hated this prison andwas always fighting to escape from jekyll s mind and body and take control he also hated jekyll s weakness and his sad hopeless condition most of all he hated jekyll s dislike ofhim this was why hyde sometimes did things to annoyjekyll he tore the doctor s books and wrote all over them he burned his letters and even destroyed a picture of thedoctor s dead father only hyde s fear of his own death stops him from killingme his love of life is terribly strong and he knows that if hekills me he too will die i almost feel sorry for him it is useless to continue this confession the final disasterhas arrived and will put an end to my punishment i shallsoon lose my own face and character for ever i have only afew doses of the drug left i sent poole to the same chemist tofetch some more chemicals when he brought them i mixed adose of the drug the liquid smoked and changed from red topurple but it did not turn green i drank it and looked in themirror but there was no effect edward hyde s face stillstared back at me i expect poole has told you that i have searched london forthe chemicals i need it is no good i have decided that thefirst chemicals i bought were not absolutely pure by accident they contained something unknown to myself or to the chemistthat prepared them and that unknown something made mydrug effective so my drug was an accidental discovery thatcannot be repeated about a week has passed i have used the last of the oldchemicals and for the moment i am henry jekyll again but icannot write much more i have very little time if hyde re turns while i am writing this confession he will tear it topieces to annoy me if i finish it however he will probablynot notice it he lives only for the moment and he is already achanged man he is like a trapped animal now he sits in mychair trembling and weeping with hate and fear all the timehe listens for the policeman s knock at the door will he becaught at last and put to death or will he be brave enough totake a dose of poison at the last moment well that is not my business this is the true hour of mydeath when you read this the henry jekyll you know will bedead the rest of the story is about edward hyde now as iput down my pen i bring the life of unhappy henry jekyll toan end txtba www txtba com the man who died i returned to my flat at about three o clock on that may afternoon very unhappy with life i has been back in britain for three months and i was already bored the weather was bad the people were dull and the amusements of london seemed as exciting as a glass of cold water richard hannay i told myself you have made a mistake and you had better do something about it it made me angry when i thought of the years i had spent in africa i had spent those years working very hard and making money not a lot of money but enough for me i had left scotland when i was six years old and i had never been home since for years i had dreamt of coming home to britain and spending the rest of my life there but i was disappointed with the place after the first week and so here i was thirty seven years old healthy with enough money to have a good time and bored to death that evening i went out to dinner and sat reading the newspapers afterwards they were full of the troubles in south east europe and there was a long report about karolides the greek prime minister he seemed to be an honest man but some people in europe hated him however many people in britain liked him and one newspaper said that he was the only man who could prevent a war starting i remember wondering if i could get a job in south east europe it might be a lot less boring than life in london as i walked home that night i decided to give britain one more day if nothing interesting happened i would take the next boat back to africa my flat was in a big new building in langham place there was a doorman at the entrance to the building but each flat was separate with its own front door i was just putting the key into my door when a man appeared next to me he was thin with a short brown beard and small very bright eyes i recognized him as the man who lived in a flat on the top floor of the building we had spoken once or twice on the stairs can i speak to you he asked may i come in for a minute his voice was shaking a little i opened the door and we went in is the door locked he asked and quickly locked it himself i m very sorry he said to me it s very rude of me but i m in a dangerous corner and you looked like the kind of man who would understand if i explain will you help me i ll listen to you i said that s all i promise i was getting worried by this strange man s behaviour there was a table with drinks on it next to him and he took a large whisky for himself he drank it quickly and then put the glass down so violently that it broke i m sorry he said i m a little nervous tonight you see at this moment i m dead i sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe how does it feel i asked i was now almost sure that the man was mad he smiled i m not mad yet listen i ve been watching you and i guess that you re not easily frightened i m going to tell you my story i need help very badly and i want to know if you re the right man to ask tell me your story i said and i ll tell you if i can help you it was an extraordinary story i didn t understand all of it and i had to ask a lot of questions but here it is his name was franklin p scudder and he was an american but he had been in south east europe for several years by accident he had discovered a group of people who were working secretly to push europe towards a war these people were clever and dangerous some of them wanted to change the world through war others simply wanted to make a lot of money and there is always money to be made from a war their plan was to get russia and germany at war with each other i want to stop them scudder told me and if i can stay alive for another month i think i can i thought you were already dead i said i ll tell you about that in a minute he answered but first do you know who constantine karolides is the greek prime minister i ve just been reading about him in today s newspapers right he s the only man who can stop the war he s intelligent he s honest and he knows what s going on and so his enemies plan to kill him i have discovered how that was very dangerous for me so i had to disappear they can t kill karolides in greece because he has too many guards but on the th of june he s coming to london for a big meeting and his enemies plan to kill him here you can warn him i said he ll stay at home that s what his enemies want if he doesn t come they ll win because he s the only man who understands the whole problem and who can stop the war happening why don t you go to the british police i said no good they could bring in five hundred policemen but they wouldn t stop the murder the murderer will be caught and he ll talk and put the blame on the governments in vienna and berlin it will all be lies of course but everybody will be ready to believe it but none of this will happen if franklin p scudder is here in london on the th of june i was beginning to like this strange little man i gave him another whisky and asked him why he thought that he was now in danger himself he took a large mouthful of whisky i came to london by a strange route through paris hamburg norway and scotland i changed my name in every country and when i got to london i thought i was safe but yesterday i realized that they re still following me there s a man watching this building and last night somebody put a card under my door on it was the name of the man i fear most in the world so i decided i had to die then they would stop looking for me i got a dead body it s easy to get one in london if you know how and i had the body brought to my flat in a large suitcase the body was the right age but the face was different from mine i dressed it in my clothes and shot it in the face with my own gun my servant will find me when he arrives in the morning and he ll call the police i ve left a lot of empty whisky bottles in my room the police will think i drank too much and then killed myself he paused i watched from the window until i saw you come home and then came down the stairs to meet you it was the strangest of stories however in my experience the most extraordinary stories are often the true ones and if the man just wanted to get into my flat and murder me why didn t he tell a simpler story right i said i ll trust you for tonight i ll lock you in this room and keep the key just one word mr scudder i believe you re honest but if you re not i should warn you that i know how to use a gun certainly he answered jumping up i m afraid i don t know your name sir but i would like to thank you and could i use your bathroom when i next saw him half an hour later i didn t recognize him at first only the bright eyes were the same his beard was gone and his hair was completely different he walked like a soldier and he was wearing glasses and he no longer spoke like an american mr scudder i cried not mr scudder he answered captain theophilus digby of the british army please remember that i made him a bed in my study and then went to bed myself happier than i had been for the past month interesting things did happen sometimes even in london the next morning when my servant paddock arrived i introduced him to captain digby i explained that the captain was an important man in the army but he had been working too hard and needed rest and quiet then i went out leaving them both in the flat when i returned at about lunchtime the doorman told me that the gentleman in flat had killed himself i went up to the top floor had a few words with the police and was able to report to scudder that his plan had been successful the police believed that the dead man was scudder and that he had killed himself scudder was very pleased for the first two days in my flat he was very calm and spent all his time reading and smoking and writing in a little black notebook but after that he became more restless and nervous it was not his own danger that he worried about but the success of his plan to prevent the murder of karolides one night he was very serious listen hannay he said i think i must tell you some more about this business i would hate to get killed without leaving someone else to carry on with my plan i didn t listen very carefully i was interested in scudder s adventures but i wasn t very interested in politics i remember that he said karolides was only in danger in london he also mentioned a woman called julia czechenyi he talked about a black stone and a man who lisped when he spoke and he described another man perhaps the most dangerous of them all an old man with a young voice who could hood his eyes like a hawk the next evening i had to go out i was meeting a man i had known in africa for dinner when i returned to the flat i was surprised to see that the light in the study was out i wondered if scudder had gone to bed early i turned on the light but there was nobody there then i saw something in the corner that made my blood turn cold scudder was lying on his back there was a long knife through his heart pinning him to the floor p p the milkman starts his travels i sat down in an armchair and felt very sick after about five minutes i started shaking the poor white face with its staring eyes was too much for me so i got a tablecloth and covered it then i took the whisky bottle and drank several mouthfuls i had seen men die violently before i had killed a few myself in the matabele war but this was different after a few more minutes i managed to calm myself down a little i looked at my watch and saw that it was halfpast ten i searched the flat carefully but there was nobody there then i locked the doors and windows by this time i was beginning to think more clearly it looked bad for me that was clear it was now certain that scudder s story was true the proof was lying under the tablecloth his enemies had found him and made sure of his silence but he had been in my flat for four days and they must think he had told his story to me so i would be the next to die it might be that night or the next day or the day after but it was sure to happen then i thought of another problem i could call the police now or go to bed and wait for paddock to discover the body and call them in the morning but what would the police think what story would i tell them about scudder i had lied to paddock about him and my story would be hard to believe they would arrest me for murder and i had no real friends in england to help me perhaps that was part of the plan an english prison would be a safe place for me until the th of june even if the police did believe my story i would still be helping scudder s enemies karolides would stay at home which was what they wanted scudder s death had made me certain that his story was true now i felt responsible for continuing his work i hate to see a good man beaten and if i carried on in scudder s place the murderers might not win i decided i must disappear and remain hidden until just before the th of june then i must contact some government people and tell them scudder s story i wished he had told me more and that i had listened more carefully to what he had told me there was a risk that the government would not believe me but it was my best chance perhaps more evidence would appear which would help me to make my story believable it was now the th of may so i had twenty days of hiding two groups of people would be looking for mescudder s enemies who would want to kill me and the police who would want me for scudder s murder there was going to be a chase and surprisingly i was almost happy about this i did not want to sit in one place and wait if i could move the situation did not seem so bad i wondered if scudder had any papers which would give me more information about his business i lifted off the table cloth and searched him there were only a few coins in his trouser pockets there was no sign of the little black notebook i supposed his murderer had taken that when i turned from the body i noticed that all the cupboards were open scudder had been a very careful man and always kept the place tidy someone had been searching for something and perhaps for the notebook i went round the flat and found that everything had been searched the insides of books cupboards boxes even the pockets of my clothes there was no sign of the notebook so scudder s enemies had probably found it in the end then i got out a map of britain my plan was to find some wild country i was used to africa and i would feel trapped in the city i thought scotland would probably be best because my family came from scotland and i could pretend to be a scotsman easily the other possibility was to be a german tourist my father had worked with germans and i had spoken german often as a boy but it would probably be better to be a scotsman in scotland i decided to go to galloway which from the map seemed to be the nearest wild part of scotland in the railway timetable i found a train from london at seven ten in the morning which would get me to galloway in the late afternoon the problem was getting to the station as i was certain that scudder s enemies were watching the building i thought about this problem had a good idea went to bed and slept for two hours i got up at four o clock the first light of a summer morning was in the sky and the birds were starting to sing i put on some old clothes which i used for country walking and some strong walking boots i pushed another shirt and a toothbrush into my pockets i had taken a lot of money out of the bank in case scudder needed it so i took that as well then i cut my long moustache as short as possible paddock arrived every morning at seven thirty but at about twenty to seven i knew the milkman would come the noise of the milk bottles usually woke me up he was a young man with a very short moustache and he wore a white coat he was my only chance i had a breakfast of biscuits and whisky and by the time i had finished it was about six o clock i got my pipe and started to fill it from my tobacco jar as i put my fingers into the tobacco i touched something hard and pulled out scudder s little black book this seemed a good sign i lifted the cloth and looked at scudder s peaceful face goodbye my friend i said i m going to do my best for you wish me good luck six thirty passed then six forty but still the milkman did not come why oh why was this the morning he had to be late at fourteen minutes to seven i heard him i opened the door quickly and he jumped a bit when he saw me come in a moment i said and we went back into the hall i can see you re a man who likes a bit of fun can you help me lend me your hat and coat for a minute and you can have this he looked at the money in my hand and smiled what do you want my clothes for he asked it s a game i said i haven t time to explain now but to win i ve got to be a milkman for ten minutes you ll be a bit late but you ll get the money for your time all right he said i like a game myself here you are i put on his blue hat and white coat picked up the empty milk bottles shut my door and went downstairs whistling at first i thought the street was empty then i saw a man walking slowly towards me as he passed he looked up at a window in the house opposite and i saw a face look back at him i crossed the street still whistling and then turned down a little side street as i dropped the hat coat and milk bottles behind a wall i heard a church clock it was seven o clock i ran to the station as fast as i could it was just ten past seven when i reached the platform i had no time to buy a ticket the train was already moving i jumped into the last carriage the hotel owner it was fine may weather as i travelled north that day and as i watched the fields and the trees and the flowers i wondered why when i had been a free man i had stayed in london i bought some sandwiches at lunch time i also bought the morning newspaper and read a little about south east europe when i had finished i got out scudder s black book and studied it it was almost full of writing mostly numbers although sometimes there was a name for example i found the words hofgaard luneville and avocado quite often the word i saw the most was pavia i was certain that scudder was using a code i have always been interested in codes i enjoy games and numbers and things like that it seemed to be a number code where groups of numbers replace letters i worked on the words because you can use a word as a key in a number code i tried for hours but none of the words helped then i fell asleep and woke up at dumfries just in time to take the local train into galloway there was a man on the platform who worried me a little he was watching the crowd more closely than i liked but he didn t look at me and when i saw myself in a mirror i understood why with my brown face and my old clothes i looked just like all the other hill farmers who were getting into the local train i travelled with a group of these farmers the train travelled slowly through narrow valleys and then up onto an open moor there were lakes and in the distance i could see high mountains at five o clock the carriage was empty and i was alone i got out at the next station a tiny place in the middle of the moor an old man was digging in the station garden he stopped walked to the train collected a packet and went back to his potatoes a ten year old child took my ticket and i came out of the station onto a white road across the moor it was a beautiful clear spring evening i felt like a boy on a walking holiday instead of a man of thirty seven very much wanted by the police i walked along the road whistling feeling happier every minute after some time i left the road and followed a path along a little stream i was getting tired when i came to a small house the woman who lived there was friendly and said i could sleep there she also gave me an excellent meal her husband came home from the hills later in the evening we talked about cows and sheep and markets and i tried to remember some of the information i heard because it might be useful by ten o clock i was asleep and i slept until five o clock in the morning the couple refused any money and by six o clock i had eaten breakfast and was moving again i wanted to get back to the railway at a different station then i would go back to the east towards dumfries i hoped that if the police were following me they would think that i had gone on to the coast in the west where i could escape by ship i walked in the same beautiful spring weather as before and still couldn t make myself feel nervous or worried after a time i came to the railway line and soon a little station which was perfect for my plan there was just a single line and moors all around i waited until i saw a train in the distance and then bought a ticket to dumfries the only person in the carriage was an old farmer with his sheepdog he was asleep and next to him was a newspaper i picked it up to see if there was any news about me there was only a short piece about the langham place murder my servant paddock had called the police and the milkman had been arrested the poor man had spent most of the day with the police but they had let him go in the evening the police believed that the real murderer had escaped from london on a train to the north when i had finished reading i looked out of the window and noticed that we were stopping at the station where i had got out yesterday three men were talking to the man who i had seen digging potatoes i sat well back from the window and watched carefully one of the men was taking notes and i supposed they were from the local police then i saw the child who had taken my ticket talking and the men looked out across the moor along that road i had taken as we left the station the farmer woke up looked at me and asked where he was he had clearly drunk too much i m like this because i never drink he said sadly i haven t touched whisky since last year not even at christmas and now i ve got this terrible headache what did it i asked a drink they call brandy i didn t touch the whisky because i don t drink but i kept drinking this brandy i ll be ill for a fortnight his voice got slower and slower and soon he fell asleep again i had planned to leave the train at a station but it now stopped by a river and i decided this would be better i looked out of the carriage window and saw nobody so i opened the door and dropped quickly down into the long grass my plan was going perfectly until the dog decided that i was stealing something and began to bark loudly this woke up the farmer who started to shout he thought i was trying to kill myself i crawled through the long grass for about a hundred metres and then looked back the train driver and several passengers were all staring in my direction luckily the dog was now so excited that he pulled the farmer out of the carriage the farmer began to slide down towards the river the otner passengers ran to help him the dog bit somebody and there was a lot of excited shouting soon they had forgotten me and the next time i looked back the train was moving again i was now in the middle of the empty moor and for the first time i felt really frightened not of the police but of the people who knew that i knew scudder s secret if they caught me i would be a dead man i reached the top of a low hill and looked around to the south a long way away i saw something which made me tremble low in the sky a small plane was flying slowly across the moor i was certain that it was looking for me and i was also certain that it was not the police i hid low in the heather and watched it for an hour or two as it flew in circles finally it disappeared to the south i did not like this spying from the air and i began to think that an open moor was perhaps not the best place to hide i could see distant forests in the east and decided that would be better country it was about six o clock in the evening when i left the moor and entered the trees i came to a bridge by a house and there on the bridge was a young man he was sitting smoking a pipe dreamily watching the water and holding a book he jumped up as he heard my feet on the road and i saw a friendly young face good evening to you he said in a serious voice it s a fine night to be on the road the smell of cooking came from the house is that house a hotel i asked it certainly is i m the owner and i hope you ll stay the night because i ve been alone for a week i sat down next to him and got out my pipe i began to think this young man might help me you re young to own a hotel i said my father died a year ago and now it s mine it s not an exciting job for a young man like me i didn t choose to do it i want to write books you ve got the right job i said with all the travellers you meet you could be the best storyteller in the world not today he said two hundred years ago there were exciting people on the road but today there are only cars full of fat old women and fishermen you can t make stories out of them i want to sail up an african river or live in an indian village and write about things like that the hotel looked peaceful in the evening sun i ve travelled a bit i said and i d be happy to live in a peaceful place like this and perhaps you re sitting next to adventure now i ll tell you a true story and you can make a book of it if you like i told him i was in the gold business in africa and i had discovered a group of international thieves they had chased me to england and had killed my best friend i described a chase across the desert and an attack on the ship from africa and i described the langham place murder in detail you want adventure i said well here it is the thieves are chasing me now and the police are chasing them it s wonderful he whispered you believe me i said gratefully of course i do he said i can believe anything strange it s things that happen every day that are difficult to believe he was very young but he was the man i needed i think my enemies have lost me for the moment but i must hide and rest for a day or two will you help me he jumped up and led me to the house you ll be safe here i can keep a secret and you ll tell me some more about your adventures won t you as i entered the hotel i heard the sound of an engine in the sky to the west was my enemy the plane he gave me a room at the back of the house i asked him to watch out for cars and planes and sat down to work on scudder s little book as i have said it was a number code i had to find the word that was the key to it and when i thought of the million words it might be i felt hopeless but the next afternoon i remembered that scudder had said a woman called julia czechenyi was the key to the karolides business so i tried her name as the code key it was the answer in half an hour i was reading with a white face suddenly i heard the sound of a car stopping outside the hotel ten minutes later my young friend came up to my room his eyes bright with excitement there are two men looking for you he whispered they re downstairs now having a drink they described you very well i told them you had stayed here last night and had left this morning i asked him to describe them one was a thin man with dark eyes the other was always smiling and lisped they were both english my young friend was certain of this i took a piece of paper and wrote these words in german i made it look like one page of a private letter black stone scudder had discovered this but he could do nothing for a fortnight i don t think it s any good now because karolides is uncertain about his plans but if mr t advises i will do the best i give this to them and say you found it in my bedroom ask them to return it to me if they find me three minutes later the car began to move from behind the curtain i saw two men in it one thin one fatter the young man came back he was very excited that paper woke them up he said happily the thin man went white and the fat one whistled then they left as quickly as they could now i ll tell you what i want you to do i said go to the police station and describe the two men to them say you think they may have something to do with the london murder i m sure those two men will be back here tomorrow morning for more information about me tell the police to be here early at about eight o clock the next morning i watched three policemen arrive they hid their car and came into the hotel twenty minutes later another car came towards the hotel but stopped in some trees about two hundred metres away the two men inside walked up to the hotel i had planned to hide in my bedroom and see what happened but now i had a better idea i wrote a note to thank the young man for his help opened my window and dropped out watching the hotel carefully i walked back towards the car in the trees jumped in and drove away t the political candidate i drove that car across the moor as fast as i could looking nervously over my shoulder i was also thinking desperately about scudder s notes scudder had told me nothing but lies all his stories about south east europe and people wanting to start wars were rubbish but although he had told me lies there was truth underneath the th of june was going to be an important day but because of something more important than the murder of a prime minister the story in his book was not complete and there were some things i didn t understand for example the words thirty nine steps which appeared five or six times the last time the words were used scudder had written thirty nine steps i counted them high tide at p m the first thing i learned was that war was certain everything was planned karolides was going to be murdered and nothing could prevent it the second thing i learned was that britain was not prepared for war karolides would be murdered and war would seem certain germany would pretend to be against war but while we and they discussed peace their submarines would silently fill the seas around us there was something else although the newspapers didn t know it the british and french governments were close allies and had agreed to prepare for war together the most important officers in the armies and navies met regularly and in june one of the top people was coming from paris for a meeting he would be told the exact details of the british navy s preparations for war but on the th of june other people were going to be in london scudder didn t give names but called them just the black stone they had a plan to get hold of this information which was meant only for the french government and the information would be used by our enemies just a week or two later with a most terrible effect my first idea was to write a letter to the british prime minister but nobody would believe my story i had to find proof that scudder s story was true and this would not be easy with the police and the black stone following me i drove to the east through a country at peace but i knew that in a month s time unless i was very lucky men would be lying dead in this quiet countryside i came into a village and i saw a policeman standing outside the post office and reading something carefully he looked up at the car stepped into the road and held up a hand to stop me i almost did stop but then i realized that the policeman had been reading about me i supposed the police at the hotel had worked quickly and contacted all the local villages i drove faster the policeman jumped out of my way and i was soon out of the village i left the main road as soon as possible and tried a smaller one it was not easy without a map and i realized that i had been stupid to steal the car it would help the police and the black stone to find me in any corner of scotland if i left it and went off on foot they would find me in an hour or two i took a road that went along a narrow valley and then up onto the moor again i was very hungry i had eaten nothing since morning and now as i drove i heard a noise in the sky and there was the plane on the moor it would see me in a minute i drove as fast as i could down into another valley and towards a wood suddenly a car appeared in front of me from a side road there was no time to stop i did the only thing possible and drove off the road into a hedge hoping to hit something soft beyond but i was out of luck the car went through the hedge like a knife through butter and immediately began to fall i jumped out and was caught by the branch of a tree while the car disappeared into a river fifteen metres below a hand helped me out of the tree and a frightened voice asked me if i was badly hurt the speaker was a young man who was very alarmed and very sorry i was more pleased than angry it was a good way for the car to disappear it s my fault i told him that s the end of my holiday but that s better than the end of my life he looked at his watch i m in a hurry but my house is very near let me give you some food and a bed but what about your luggage is it in the river it s in my pocket i said i m from australia so i never carry much luggage from australia he cried you re just the man i need we got into his car and in three minutes we were at his very comfortable house he found some food for me you ve only got five minutes i m afraid but you can eat properly after wards we ve got to be at the meeting at eight o clock you see i m a candidate for the election and i ve got a problem tonight i had arranged for crumpleton who was the australian prime minister to speak at the meeting tonight but he s ill i ve got to speak for forty minutes and i don t know what to say listen my you haven t told me your name twisdon you say well mr twisdon can you talk about australia for a few minutes it seemed strange to ask a man you had met in a car crash to speak at an election meeting but i needed his help all right i said i m not a good speaker but i ll speak for a bit he was delighted we got in his car and on the way to the meeting he told me about his life his name was sir harry andrews and his uncle was in the government and had suggested politics as a job he knew nothing about politics but he was a friendly young man and i was glad to help him when we arrived at the meeting there were about five hundred people waiting i was introduced as a trusted australian leader and then sir harry started to speak it was mostly about preparing for war he said the germans didn t want a war and that if we stopped building new warships the germans would do the same i thought about scudder s black book in my pocket but behind all the rubbish i could see that sir harry was a nice man and he spoke very badly i knew i wasn t a good speaker but i would be better than him i simply told them everything i knew about australia i said that britain and australia must work together and be friends i think i was rather a success when we were back in his car again sir harry was delight ed you spoke wonderfully twisdon he said now you must stay for a few days there s excellent fishing here we had a good supper which i needed and sat in front of a fire in his sitting room i thought the time had come for me to tell the truth and see if this man could help me listen sir harry i ve got something very important to say to you you re an honest man and i m going to be honest too everything you said tonight was dangerous rubbish was it i wasn t sure myself do you think germany is going to start a war with us in six weeks time you won t need to ask me that listen and i ll tell you a story i sat in front of the fire in that peaceful room and told him everything he heard about scudder his notebook the milk man and my travels in scotland it was the first time i had told the truth all of it to anyone and i felt better so you see i said finally i m the man the police want for the langham place murder you should call them at once he looked at me carefully i know you re not a murderer hannay and i believe you re speaking the truth i ll help you what do you want me to do first write to your uncle i must contact the government before the th of june he pulled his moustache that won t help you my uncle isn t interested in foreign politics and i don t think he d be lieve you no i ll write to a friend of his sir walter bulli vant who works in the foreign office he s an intelligent man and i think he d help what shall i say so he wrote a letter to sir walter saying that if a man named twisdon came to him he should help him twisdon would say the words black stone and would whistle the song annie laurie to prove who he was he told me where sir walter lived and asked me what more he could do can you lend me some old clothes and give me a map and if the police come show them the car in the river i then slept for three or four hours until sir harry woke me at two o clock he gave me an old bicycle for the first part of the journey the adventure of the roadman i sat down at the top of a hill and rested behind me was a road climbing out of a river valley in front were two kilometres of flat open country to the left and the right were green hills a kilometre down the road behind me i could see the smoke from a small house but otherwise there was no sign of human life there were only the sounds of birds singing and water flowing it was now about seven o clock in the morning and as i waited i heard the sound of an engine in the air i realized that i was in a bad position because i had nowhere to hide i sat hopelessly as the aeroplane came nearer it was high at first but then it came down very low i could see one of the two men looking at me very carefully then suddenly it went up and disappeared i had to think quickly my enemies had found me so now i supposed they would put a circle of men around the hills they had probably seen my bicycle so they would expect me to try and escape by road i found a small lake about a hundred metres from the road and threw the bicycle in then i climbed to a higher bit of ground and looked around there was nowhere to hide the moor was open but to me it was like a prison i started to walk to the north and as iwalked i saw a car about fifteen kilometres away on the road and in the valley below me i could see a line of men walking slowly upwards the north was no good i turned and began to run southwards i ran hard watching the skyline in front of me and soon i thought i could see distant figures on the hill i turned again and ran down to the road if you have enemies all around you the best plan is to hide while they search and do not find you but there was nothing to hide in nothing but the moor the heather and the white road then in a bend in the road i found the roadman he had just started work mending the road when he saw me i m sorry i ever stopped farming he said i was my own boss then now i have to do what the government orders and i m a prisoner here with aching eyes and a bad back and my head s going to explode he was about the same age as me and wore big black glass es he started to work again and then stopped i can t do it he cried i m going back to bed i asked him what the problem was although i could guess it was my daughter s wedding last night so we were dancing and drinking until four o clock in the morning and the new road inspector is coming to visit today he ll comeand not find me or he ll come and find me like this whatev er happens i m finished then i had an idea does this new inspector know you no he started last week where s your house he pointed to the small house i had seen before well go back to bed i said and sleep in peace i ll do your job for the day and see the inspector he stared at me for a minute then smiled you re the man for me it s an easy job he pointed to several big heaps of stones along the side of the road just put the stones down all along the edges of the road my name s alexander turnbull but my friends call me ecky if you speak to the inspector politely he ll be happy i ll come back at five o clock i borrowed his glassed and a very dirty hat and gave him my good clothes i also borrowed a very old pipe my new friend walked off slowly to his bed i hoped he would be inside his house when my enemies arrived i put as much dirt as possible on my face hands and clothes and rubbed some into my eyes to make them red my boots did not look like a workman s boots so i kicked them against the rocks to make them look older the roadman had left his sandwiches and i was happy to eat some of them there was still nothing moving on the road when i started work after some time i was getting hot and i was beginning to count the hours until evening when i heard a voice and saw a young man in a small car looking at me are you alexander turnbull he said i m the new road inspector you re doing these edges well but there s a soft place about a kilometre down the hill don t forget that will you good day now clearly the inspector thought i was the roadman as time passed one or two other cars came along the road and i bought some biscuits from a travelling shop finally a big car stopped and two men got out and walked towards me i had seen them before from the window of the hotel the fatter of the two looked at me with sharp bright eyes good morning he said that s an easy job you ve got there there are worse jobs and there are btter jobs i said i spoke in alexander turnbull s strong scottish accent the other man was looking at my boots you ve very fine boots were they made near here oh no the were made in london i was given them by a man who was here on holiday last year the fatter man spoke to the other in german let s move on this man can t help us they did ask one more question did you see anyone pass early this morning either on a bi cycle or on foot i pretended to think carefully i wasn t up very early you see my daughter got married yesterday and i went to bed late i looked out of the house at seven and there was nobody on the road and i ve seen no bicycles this morning the thin man gave me a cigar which i smelt and then put in my pocket then they got into the car and were soon out of sight i continued to work on the road and i was right to do so ten minutes later they passed again watching me carefully i hoped mr turnbull would stay in bed and i began to won der what to do next i couldn t mend roads for ever just before five o clock an open touring car came up the road and stopped a few metres from me the driver wanted to light a cigarette and by an extraordinary chance i knew him his name was marmaduke jopley and he was a man i disliked very much he was only interested in people with money and in visiting people who lived in beautiful houses in the country i ran up to the car and took his arm hallo jopley his mouth opened wide as he looked at me who are you my name s hannay i said you remember me the murderer he cried yes and there ll be another murder if you don t help me give me your coat and hat he did what i asked he was very frightened i put his coat and hat on and put mr turnbull s hat on jopley s head i got in the car and started it now my friend i sald you sit quietly and be a good boy i m going to borrow your car for an hour or two i enjoyed the drive we had that evening as we drove through the valley i noticed some men beside the road but they didn t look at us i drove on into the hills and as it start ed to get dark i turned up a small road and stopped in the middle of a lonely moor i returned the hat and coat to jopley thank you very much i sald you can be quite useful now you d better go and find the police as i sat on the moor and watched the car s lights disappear i thought about my new life as a criminal i was not a murder er but i had developed a habit of stealing expensive cars the bald writer spent the night in the hills in some thick heather be hind a rock i had no coat and i was very cold my coat scudder s notebook my watch and even my pipe and tobacco were with mr turnbull all i had was some biscuits i had half the biscuits for supper and tried to keep warm in the heather i was feeling quite pleased so far i had been very lucky the milkman the man at the hotel sir harry the roadman and even marmaduke had all helped me and i felt that with help like this i might win my main problem now was that i was very hungry i fell asleep imagining the most beautiful meals i woke up very cold in the early morning i looked down the hill and in a second i was putting my boots on as fast as i could there were men only a few hundred metres below me walking up and searching the heather step by step keeping low in the heather i moved up the hill at the top i stood up and showed myself i heard men shouting and then i pretended to disappear over the top of the hill but in fact i got down in the heather and crawled back down into the valley after twenty minutes i looked back and saw the men disappearing over the top of the hill i didn t know where i was but i knew i must keep moving i was twenty minutes in front of them but they were local men and they knew these hills better than i did soon they were close behind me and i was running as fast as i could after a time i saw to my left some trees and the chim neys of a farmhouse i ran down towards them and found my self in a garden as i came nearer the house i saw an old man looking at me through an open door i crossed the garden and went in i was in a pleasant room with books everywhere at a desk in the middle sat an old man with a kind face he had glasses on the end of his nose and the top of his bald head shone like glass he didn t move but looked up and waited for me to speak i was so surprised by his calmness that for a minute i just stared at him you re in a hurry my friend he said slowly i looked out of the window at the moor we could both see the line of men walking through the heather ah i see he said the police are after you are they well we ll talk about it later i don t like the police in my house when i m working go through that door on the left and close it behind you you will be safe in there and this extraordinary man picked up his pen and started to write i did what he said and found myself in a small room with only a very small window high up in one wall the door closed behind me once again i had found somewhere to hide but i didn t feel comfortable there was something strange about the old man i had suddenly appeared in his house but he didn t seem surprised and his eyes were frighteningly in telligent i waited and tried to forget that i was very hungry i thought about breakfast and suddenly the door opened and there was the old man again i told the police you had gone over the hill this is a lucky morning for you mr richard hannay he said smiling as he spoke his eyes half closed and immediately i re membered scudder s description of a man who could hood his eyes like a hawk i saw that i had walked into the hands of my enemies my first thought was to knock him down and run but two men came through the door they were carrying guns the old man knew my name but he had never seen me be fore i took a chance i don t know what you mean i said roughly and who are you calling hannay my name s ainslie of course you have many names he said still smiling we won t argue about a name i looked at him angrily i suppose you re going to call the police back i wish i d never seen that car here s the money i put four pounds on the table i won t call the police he said this is a private problem between yon and me oh stop it i cried i ve had no luck since i left my ship in edinburgh i found a crashed car and took a little money out of it and i ve had the police after me for two days you do what you like ned ainslie s finished i could hear doubt in his voice when he next spoke would you be kind enough to tell me what you ve been do ing for the last few days i can t i haven t eaten for two days give me something to eat and i ll tell you the truth i put on my best begging voice some food was brought to me and while i was eating he said something to me in german i stared at him stupidly then i told him my story i was a sailor and i had left my ship in edinburgh to travel across scotland to see my brother i had found a car in a river and taken some money from it but the police were now chasing me they can have their money back i cried it s only brought me trouble you re good at lying hannay he said i started to get very angry my name s ainslie and i don t know anybody called hannay i d rather have the police than you and your guns and your hannays no i m sorry sir i m grateful for the food but i d like to go now i could see that he was not sure he had never seen me and i suppose i did not look like my photograph i won t let you go if you are mr ainslie then you ll soon be able to prove it if you re not then i have a surprise for you he rang a bell and a third servant appeared i want the car in five minutes he said there will be three for lunch then he looked at me and that was the most frightening thing of all his eyes were unnatural bright cold and evil i tried to stare back and even to smile you ll know me next time we meet i said karl he said speaking in german put this man in the back room until i return i was taken out of the room with a gun at each ear the back room was very dark and full of old bottles and boxes the windows had shutters on the outside the key turned in the door and i could hear the feet of the guards outside i sat down feeling very unhappy the old man had gone to collect his friends the men who had talked to me when i was the roadman they would soon discover that i was not the roadman nor mr ainslie but richard hannay i began to wish i had been found by the police i would feel safer with them than with this man and his two friends they were coming for lunch so i had only two hours i tried the windows but they would not move i felt the boxes and bottles and then found a door in the wall it was a cup board door and it was locked i had nothing else to do so i pulled on it until it opened there were a lot of things inside on one shelf there were some matches and i used them to look more closely at the back of one shelf was a strong wooden box i broke it open and found to my surprise some fuses and several small square packets of explosive i knew that with these i could blow the house up the problem was that i didn t know how much to use if i used too much i would blow myself up but if i didn t use them at all i would be dead in three hours i put one of the squares of explosive near the door and put a fuse from there to the other side of the room i lit the fuse and hid behind some boxes there was silence for five seconds the wall exploded into a bright yellow light something fell on my left arm and i became unconscious i was unconscious for only a few seconds then i stood up trying not to breathe the yellow smoke the window had been blown out and i climbed out into the garden across the gar den there were some buildings and one was an old tower i felt too ill to go very far and that seemed the best hiding place the climb up the outside of that tower was the most difficult thing i ever did my head felt terrible and the smoke had made me very sick but in the end i managed it and lay down at the top then i became unconscious again when i woke up my head was burning and the sun was shining into my face i lay for a long time without moving i could hear men talking i looked through a hole in the wall and saw men with guns there was the bald man and i thought i could see the fat one too for half an hour they searched all the buildings they came to the door at the bottom of my tower and for a minute i thought they were going to come up but the door was locked all afternoon i lay on that roof i was terribly thirsty and to make it worse i could see and hear a small stream which came off the moor and flowed near the farm i wanted a drink of that cool clear water more than anything in the world from the tower i could see all the moor around i saw two men go off in a car and another man on a horse and i imag ined they were looking for me but i could also see something more interesting at the top of the hill behind the house was a ring of trees with grass inside it was clear that this was where the plane landed it was an excellent place for an airfield it could not be seen from below because it was at the top of the hill from the valley the hill seemed covered with trees and anyone watching the plane coming in to land would think it was just flying over the hill i realized that if the plane arrived now the pilot would probably see me so i lay still and hoped night would come quickly luckily when the plane did arrive it was almost dark i watched it land and then waited until everything was quiet there was no moon and i was too thirsty to wait so at nine o clock i climbed down halfway down somebody came out of the house with a light and i froze then the light disap peared and i continued down to the ground i crawled as far as the trees i guessed that the house would be guarded in some way so i continued very slowly and care fully and found a wire about sixty centimetres from the ground falling over that would doubtless start alarm bells ringing in the house a hundred metres further on there was another wire but after that it was the open moor ten minutes later i had my head in the stream and i drank litres of cold water i did not stop again until i was ten kilometres from that terrible house the fisherman sat on a hill top and thought about my next move i wasn t very happy because although i had escaped i was feeling very ill the smoke had been very unpleasant and the day on the roof had made things worse i had a terrible headache and my arm hurt so badly that i could not move it i decided to go back to mr turnbull s house and find my clothes and scudder s notebook then i would take a train to the south the sooner i met sir harry s friend in the government sir walter bullivant the better i hoped he would believe my story but even if he did not i would be safer with him or even the british police than with those men at the farmhouse it was a clear starry night and easy to find my way across the hills i thought i was probably about thirty kilometres from mr turnbull s house so i could not get there in one night i would have to hide somewhere for the day when it started to get light i stopped to wash in a river and then knocked on the door of a small house i told the woman who lived there that i had had a bad fall and she could see that i was not well she gave me some milk and whisky she also gave me an old coat and hat of her husband s i now looked like every other scotsman and felt safer it started to rain and i spent the afternoon under a rock that night was the most miserable of all there were no stars and i got lost a least twice i had about fifteen kilometres more to go but i think i walked thirty in the end in the very early morning in a thick fog i knocked on mr turnbull s door mr turnbull opened the door wearing an old black suit and a tie at first he did not recognize me what are you doing here at this time on a sunday morning my head was so bad that i could not answer for a moment but then he recognized me and saw that i was ill have you got my glasses he asked i took them out of my pocket and gave them to him you want your clothes he said come in you re not looking well at all come and sit down i realized that my malaria had come back i had had malaria in africa and it returned sometimes the smoke my arm the wet and the cold had probably not helped soon mr turnbull was helping me into a bed he was a good friend that roadman he took care of me for ten days until my fever had gone and my arm was much bet ter he went out to work every day locking the door and in the evening he sat by the fire he asked no questions but on some days he brought me a newspaper and i saw that the ex citement over the langham place murder was over one day he gave me my money back there s a lot of mon ey there you d better count it and see if it s all there i wanted to move as soon as possible but it was not until the th of june that i felt well enough to go i made turnbull accept some money for my food but it was difficult i walked the twenty kilometres to the station in a day the train to london did not leave until night so i rested in the heather until it arrived i was very happy to be in the train and on the way south i slept on the train until early morning then i changed trains two or three times at about eight o clock in the evening i arrived at the small station at artinswell to the west of london the road led through a wood into a green valley soon i came to a bridge and looked down into the river whistling the song annie laurie a fisherman walked up from the river and as he got near to me he started to whistle the same song he was a big man in old clothes and a wide hat he smiled at me and i looked at his kind intelligent face the water s clear isn t it he said look at that big fish lying on the bottom i ve been trying to catch him all evening i can t see him i said look over there near those plants oh yes i can see him now he looks like a black stone he whistled again then paused your name s twisdon isn t it no i said i mean yes i had forgotten the name i had given sir harry it s a good idea to know your own name he said smiling i looked at him again and began to think that this kind in telligent man would be a real ally at last then he pointed to a house by the river and said quietly wait five minutes then come to the back door he walked i did as he asked and found the back door open and a ser vant waiting come this way sir he said and took me to a bedroom there were clothes waiting for me and shaving things there s a bathroom next door dinner is in half an hour the servant left and i sat down i was very surprised but also delighted sir walter clearly believed that i was not a murderer although when i looked at myself in the mirror i thought i looked very much like one i had a bath and shaved and put on the clothes when i had finished i looked in the mirror again this time i saw a com pletely different young man sir walter was waiting for me in the dining room i decided i must tell him the truth about myself immediately i must thank you very much but i must make something clear i said i m not a murderer but the police want me if you d like me to leave i ll leave now he smiled that s all right we won t let it stop us eating let s talk after dinner the food and wine were excellent after dinner we went to the sitting room for coffee and he looked at me i ve done what harry asked me to do he said he told me you d tell me a story to wake me up it i did so what is your story mr hannay i notoced that he was using my real name i told him the whole story from the night i came home and found scudder at my door i told him what scudder had told me about karolides and saw him smile once or twice then i told him about the murder and the milkman and scotland and scudder s notebook you ve got it here he asked and looked pleased when i took it from my pocket i said nothing about what i had read in scudder s notes then i told him about my meeting with sir harry and he laughed my day as a roadman interested him he made me describe the two men in the car and seemed to be thinking hard then he laughed again at my adventure with mar maduke jopley when i described the old man in the farm house he stopped smiling old bald and hoods his eyes like a hawk i don t like the sound of him and you blew up his house you re a brave man i reached the end of my story he stood up by the fire and looked down at me you don t need to worry about the police he said they don t want you any more have they arrested the murderer no but they know it s not you how because i heard from scudder i knew him a bit he was astrange man but he was honest i had a letter from him on the st of may but he d been dead for a week by then the letter was written and posted on the rd his letters usually went to spaim and then newcastle so they took a week to arrive what did he say that he was in danger he said he was living in langham place and that he was with a good friend i think he wanted to help you in case he was murdered when i got the letter i went to scotland yard and talked to the police you can imagine that i felt ten times better i was a free man and my only enemies were my country s enemies now let s see this notebook said sir walter it took us an hour to work through it i explained the code and he understood very quickly when we had finished he sat silent for a while i don t understand all of this he said at last he s right about one thing and that is the meeting on the th how can anyone have discovered about that but all this about war and the black stone it s very strange scudder did like to make things seem important and exciting the black stone he repeated it s like a cheap detective story and all this about karolides can t be true karolides will be alive when we re both dead no scudder s wrong there there are some unpleasant things going on scudder found something out and got killed for it but all this about stealing the navy s war plans i can t really believe it just then the servant came into the room there s a telephone call from london for you sir sir walter went out he came back five minutes later with a white face i apologize to scudder he whispered and then looked at me karolides was shot dead at seven o clock this evening the coming of the black stone came down to breakfast the next morning and found sir walter reading a coded message he seemed less re laxed than yesterday i was very busy for an hour after you went to bed he said i ve arranged for the frenchman royer to come a day early he will be in london at five o clock i don t think the change of day will help very much if our enemies already knew he was coming they will probably find out that the plans have changed i would love to know how the news of his visit escaped while i ate he continued to talk i was surprised that he was telling me all these important secrets can t the navy s war plans be changed i asked they could he said but we want to avoid that it would be very difficult and some changes would be impossible but the big problem is that they re not going to steal the plans in the street they ll try to get the details without anybody knowing and royer will return to paris thinking that every thing is still secret then we must stay at royer s side until he is home again i said royer will meet us after dinner at my house in london there ll be whittaker from the navy myself sir arthur drew and general winstanley the first sea lord the head of the navy has been ill and may not be able to come whittaker will give royer the important papers and then royer will be driven to portsmouth where a navy ship will take him to france he will be watched until he is back there whittaker will be watched while he has the papers before he meets royer it s the best we can do and i don t see what can go wrong but i m very nervous because of the murder of karolides after breakfast he asked me to be his driver for the day you know what these people are like and i don t want to take risks in london we went first to scotland yard where we met an important looking policeman i ve brought you the langham place murderer said sir walter the policeman smiled i wish you had i imagine you are mr hannay we were very interested in you for a few days mr hannay will interest you again macgillivray but his story must wait twenty four hours but i would like you to tell mr hannay that you don t want to arrest him any more of course we don t the policeman turned to me your flat and your servant are waiting for you although you may not want to return there as sir walter and i left he said i was free for the rest of the day come and see me tomorrow hannay i don t need to tell you to keep everything secret you had better stay out of sight if your black stone friends see you there might be trouble i didn t know what to do it was strange to be a free man i went to a very good restaurant for lunch but i was still feeling nervous when anybody looked at me i wondered if they were thinking about the murder i walked around london thinking i knew that by now royer would be in england and i felt sure that something terrible was going to happen and that only i could stop it but it was not my business now i didn t want to go back to my flat i had to go back some time but i decided to stay at a hotel tonight i had supper in another restaurant and thought that after that i would go to sir walter s house he might not want me there but i would feel happier if i went as i walked through london towards his house i met a group of young men one of them was marmaduke jopley it s the murderer he cried stop him that s hannay the langham place murderer he took hold of my arm and the others crowded round me i didn t want trouble but i was feeling angry a policeman came up and instead of explaining the mistake to him quietly and sensibly i just hit out wildly at marmaduke s stupid face i felt much happier when he was lying on his back in the road then a general fight started until the policeman got hold of me i heard him ask what the matter was and marmaduke talking through his broken teeth told him that i was hannay the murderer i was so angry that i pushed the policeman one way and one of marmaduke s friends the other and ran as fast as i could there was shouting behind me but i had escaped i ran all the way to sir walter s house walked up to the door and rang i hoped the door would open quickly it did i must see sir walter i said to the servant it s desper ately important the servant let me in and then shut the door behind me sir walter is in a meeting sir perhaps you will wait there was a telephone and one or two chairs in the hall and i sat down there listen i whispered to the servant i m in a bit of trouble but i m working for sir walter if anyone comes to the door and asks for me tell them i m not here there was a sudden ringing at the door and he went to open it he told them whose house it was and that nobody could come in and then shut the door a few minutes later there was another ring at the door and the servant did not hesitate to let this visitor in everybody knew his face from the newspapers a square grey beard and bright blue eyes lord alloa the first sea lord and head of the british navy he was shown into a room at the end of the hall i sat there for twenty minutes surely the meeting would end soon royer must leave for portsmouth by eleven o clock then the door opened again and the first sea lord came out he walked past me and in passing he looked at me and for a second i looked into his eyes it was only for a second but my heart jumped the first sea lord had never seen me before but in his eyes i saw that he recognized me then he passed me and was out of the door into the street i picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of lord alloa s house i spoke to one of his servants is lord alloa at home i asked yes but he s ill and has been in bed all day do you want to leave a message sir i put down the telephone and sat down shaking my part in this business was not finished i walked straight into the room where the others were meeting sir walter looked surprised and annoyed i m afraid that this is not a good time mr hannay i think it is i answered tell me please who left this room a minute ago lord alloa said sir walter looking angrier it was not i cried it looked like him but it was not him it was a man who recognized me who has seen me in the last month i ve just telephoned lord alloa s house and he s been ill in bed all day who someone asked the black stone i cried sitting down and looking at five frightened men the thirty nine steps sir walter got up and left the room he came back after ten minutes i ve spoken to alloa i got him out of bed he was very angry he hasn t left his house all day it s impossible said winstanley i sat next to him for nearly half an hour that s what s so clever i said you were too interested in other things to look at him closely you knew that he might be well enough to come tonight and as first sea lord it was natural for him to be here why should you suspect that it wasn t him then the frenchman spoke very slowly and in good english this young man is right he understands our enemies people only see what they expect to see this man came late spoke little and left early but he behaved exactly as we would expect lord alloa to behave but i don t understand said winstanley our enemies don t want us to know what they have learnt about our war plans but if one us talked to alloa abut tonight s meeting we would discover immediately that he hadn t been here sir walter laughed angrily that shows their cleverness again in choosing alloa they took a risk but everybody knows that alloa is a sick man and is often too ill to go to meetings and even when he is well he is impatient difficult and a man of very few words which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight but the spy hasn t taken the plans said winstanley he saw them but could he carry away pages of information in his head it s not difficult said the frenchman a good spy can remember things photographically well i suppose we ll have to change our plans said sir walter unhappily there s another problem said royer i said a lot about the plans of the french army that information will be very valuable to our enemies that man and his friends must be stopped immediately they could simply send their information in a letter said whittaker it may already be in the post no said rower a spy brings home his information personally and he collects his pay personally these men must cross the sea so we still have a chance you must watch the coast and search ships it is desperately important for both france and britain royer was right we could do something but none of us felt very hopeful how among the forty million people in britain could we find the three cleverest criminals in europe then suddenly i had an idea where is scudder s book i asked sir walter quick i remember something in it he gave it to me i found the place thirty nine steps i read and again thirty nine steps i counted them high tide p m whittaker clearly thought i had gone mad don t you see it s a clue i cried scudder knew where they were going to leave england tomorrow was the day and it s somewhere where high tide is at perhaps they ve already gone tonight someone suggested not them they have their own secret way and why should they hurry they don t know that we re after them where can i get a book of tide tables whittaker looked happier it s a chance he said let s go to the navy offices sir walter went off to scotland yard to get macgilllvray the rest of us drove to the navy offices where we went to a big room full of books and maps we got a copy of the tide tables and i sat down and looked through it while the others watched it was no good there were more than fifty places where high tide was at we needed more information than that i thought hard what did scudder mean by steps and why was it so important to count them it must be somewhere with several paths going down to the sea this path would be the only one with thirty nine steps i had another thought and checked the time of regular ships leaving england there was no ship at why was high tide important in a big harbour the tide doesn t matter it is only important in a small harbour or somewhere where there is no harbour at all then i thought about where a man would leave england if he were going to germany not from the south coast or the west coast or scotland it would be somewhere on the east coast probably between cromer and dover i am not sherlock holmes but i am used to using my head and when i guess my guesses are often right i wrote out my ideas on a piece of paper almost certain a place where there are several paths down to the sea one of these has thirty nine steps high tide at p m a place where it is only possible for a ship to leave the coast at high tide probably not a harbour but open coast with cliffs and a beach ship probably a small one a yacht or a fishing boat somewhere on the east coast between cromer and dover it seemed strange to be sitting at a table watched by a groupof very important people trying to understand something written by a dead man but it was a matter of life or death to us sir walter and macgillivray arrived they had men watching all the harbours and railway stations with descriptions of the three men but none of us thought that this would help here s the best i can do i said we have to find a place where there is a path with thirty nine steps down to a beach it must be somewhere on the east coast of course it s somewhere where high tide is at tomorrow night who can we ask who knows the east coast really well whittaker said he knew a man who lived in south london he went off in a car to get him and came back at about one o clock in the morning with an old sailor who had worked all his life on the east coast we want you to tell us about places you know on the east coast where there are cliffs and steps going down to the beach said winstanley he thought for a minute or two there are a lot of seaside towns holiday places where there are steps from the town down to the beach no that s not private enough i said well i don t know of course there s the ruff what s that it s in kent near bradgate there are cliffs with houses along the top big houses some of the houses have steps down to a beach mostly rich people live there the sort of people who like to be private i opened the tide tables at bradgate high tide was at on the th of june this looks hopeful i cried how can i find out when high tide is at the ruff i can tell you that sir said the sailor i used to go fishing there high tide is ten minutes before bradgate i closed the book and looked up at the others if one of those paths has thirty nine steps then i think we have a good chance i said can i take a car sir walter and a map if mr macgillivray can help me perhaps we can prepare something for tomorrow it seemed strange for me to take control like this but i was used to action and they could see it it was the frenchman royer who said what they were all thinking i am quite happy he said to leave this business in mr hannay s hands at half past three in the morning i was driving through kent in the moonlight with macgillivray next to me meetings by the sea it was a fine blue june morning and i was outside a hotel in bradgate looking out to sea there was a ship out there and i could see that it was a warship of some kind mac gillivray had been in the navy and knew the ship i sent a message to sir walter to ask if it could help us if necessary after breakfast we walked along the beach under the ruff i kept hidden while macgillivray counted the six lots of steps in the cliff i waited for an hour while he counted and when i saw him coming towards me with a piece of paper i was very nervous he read out the numbers thirty four thirty five thirtynine forty two forty seven and twenty one i almost got up and shouted we walked back to bradgate quickly macgillivray had six policemen sent down from london he then went off to look at the house at the top of the thirty nine steps the information he brought back was neither good nor bad the house was called trafalgar house and belonged to an old man called appleton he was there at the moment the neighbours didn t know him well macgillivray had then gone to the back door of the house pretending to be a man selling sewing machines there were three servants and he spoke to the cook he was sure she knew nothing next door a new house was being built which might be a good place to watch from and on the other side the house was empty its garden was rather wild and would also be a good place to hide in i took a telescope and found a good hiding place from which to watch the house i watched for a time and saw an old man leave the house and walk into the back garden at the top of the cliff he sat down to read a newspaper but he looked out to sea several times i thought he was probably looking at the warship i watched him for half an hour until he went back into the house for lunch then i went back to the hotel formine i wasn t feeling very confident that old man might be the old man i had met in the farmhouse on the moors but there are hundreds of old men in houses by the sea and he was probably just a nice old man on his holidays after lunch i sat in front of the hotel and looked out to sea and then i felt happier because i saw something new a yacht came up the coast and stopped a few hundred metres off the ruff macgillivray and i went down to the harbour got a boat and spent the afternoon fishing we caught quite a lot of fish and then at about four o clock went to look at the yacht it looked like a fast boat and its name was the ariadne i spoke to a sailor who was cleaning the side of the boat and he was certainly english so was the next sailor we spoke to and we had quite a long conversation about the weather then suddenly the men stopped talking and started work again and a man in uniform walked up he was a pleasant friendly man and asked us about the fishing in very goodenglish but i was sure that he was not english himself i felt a little more confident after seeing him but as we went back to bradgate i was still not sure my enemies had killed scudder because they thought he was a danger to them they had tried to kill me for the same reason so why hadn t they changed their escape plans they didn t know about scudder s black notebook but why stay with the same plan when there was a chance that i knew about it it seemed a stupid risk to take i decided to spend an hour or two watching trafalgar house and found a good place where i could look down on the garden i could see two men playing tennis one was the old man i had already seen the other was a younger fatter man they played well and were clearly enjoying themselves like two businessmen on holiday i have never seen anything more harmless they stopped for a drink and i asked myself if i wasn t the most stupid man alive these were two normal boring englishmen not the clever murderers that i had met in scotland then a third man arrived on a bicycle he walked into the garden and started talking to the tennis players they were all laughing in a very english way soon they went back into the house laughing and talking and i stayed there feeling stupid these men might be acting but why they didn t know i was watching and listening to them they were just three perfectly normal harmless englishmen but there were three of them and one was old and one was fat and one was thin and dark and a yacht was waiting a kilometre away with at least one german on it i thought about karolides lying dead and all europe trembling on the edge of war and about the men waiting in london hoping that i would do something to stop these spies i decided there was only one thing to do i had to continue and just hope for the best i didn t want to do it i would rather walk into a room full of wild animals than walk into that happy english house and tell those three men they were under arrest how they would laugh at me then i remembered something that an old friend in africa once told me he had often been in trouble with the police he once talked about disguises with me and he said that the way somebody looked was not the real secret he said that what mattered was the feel of somebody if you moved to completely different surroundings and if you looked comfortable and at home there you would be very difficult to recognize my friend had once borrowed a black coat and tie and gone to church and stood next to the policemen who was looking for him the policemen had only seen him shooting out the lights in a pub and he did not recognize him in a church perhaps these people were playing the same game a stupid man tries to look different a clever man looks the same and is different my friend had also told me this if you want to disguise yourself you must believe that you re the person you re pretending to be that would explain the game of tennis these men weren t acting they just changed from one life to another and the new life was as natural as the old it is the secret of all great criminals it was now about eight o clock i went back to seemacgillivray and we arranged where the other policeman would hide after that i went for a walk along the coast looking at the peaceful people on holiday out at sea i could see lights on the ariadne and on the warship and further away the lights of other ships everything seemed so normal and peaceful that i couldn t believe the three men were my criminals but i turned and walked towards trafalgar house at about half past nine macgillivray s men were i supposed in their hiding places the house was quiet but i could just hear the sound of voices the men were just finishing their dinner feeling very stupid i walked up to the door and rang the bell when a servant opened the door i asked for mr appleton and was shown in i had planned to walk straight in and surprize the men into recognizing me but i started looking at all the pictures on the wall there were photographs of groups of english schoolboys and lots of other things that you only find in an english home the servant walked in front of me into the dining room and told the men who i was and i missed the chance of surprise when i walked in the old man stood up and turned round to meet me the other two turned to look at me the old man was perfectly polite mr hannay he said did you wish to see me i pulled up a chair and sat down i think we ve met before i said and i guess you know why i m here the light in the room was not bright but i think they all looked very surprised perhaps perhaps said the old man i m afraid i don t remember faces very well you ll have to tell me why you re here because i really don t know well i said although i didn t really believe what i was saying i have come to arrest all three of you arrest said the old man in surprise arrest what for for the murder of franklin scudder in london on the rd of may i ve never heard the name before said the old man one of the others spoke that was the langham place murder i read about that in the newspapers but you must be mad where do you come from scotland yard i said then there was silence for a moment until the fat one started to talk hesitating a lot between words don t worry uncle it s all a stupid mistake even the police make mistakes i wasn t even in england on the rd and bob was in hospital you were in london but you can explain what you were doing you re right percy it s easy the rd that was the day after agatha s wedding yes i had lunch with charlie symons and in the evening i went to the cardwells why they gave me that he pointed to a cigar box on the table i think you will see that you have made a mistake the thin dark man said to me politely we are quite happy to help scotland yard and we don t want the police to make stupid mistakes that s so isn t it uncle certainly bob the old man looked happier now certainly we ll help if we can but this is madness this will make our friends laugh said the fat man they think we re boring and that nothing ever happens to us hebegan to laugh very pleasantly yes it s a good story really mr hannay i should be angry but it s too funny you really frightened me you looked too serious i thought i d killed somebody in my sleep they weren t acting there was nothing false about them at first i wanted to apologize and leave then i stood up and went to the door and turned on the main light i looked at the three faces i saw nothing to help me one was old and bald one was fat one was dark and thin they could be the three men i had seen in scotland but i could see nothing to prove it well said the old man politely are you sure now that we are not murderers or are you going to take us to the police station there was nothing to do except call in the men outside and arrest them or say i had made a mistake and leave and i couldn t decide while we re waiting let s have a game of cards said the fat one it will give mr hannay time to think and we need a fourth player will you play i agreed but everything suddenly seemed unreal we went into another room where there was a table and cards the window was open and the moon was shining on the cliffs and the sea we played and they talked i m usually quite good at cards but that night i played extremely badly then something woke me up the old man put his cards down for a moment and sat back in his chair with his hand on his knee it was a movement i had seen before in that farm on the moors with two servants with guns behind me suddenly my head cleared and i looked at the three men differently it was ten o clock the three faces seemed to change in front of my eyes the thin dark man was the murderer his knife had killed scudder the fat man had been the first sea lord last night but the old man was the worst how had i ever thought he looked kind and friendly his eyes were cold and evil and frightening i went on playing but i hated him more and more with every card look at the time bob said the old man don t forget you ve got a train to catch he must be in london tonight he said turning to me his voice now sounded completely false i m afraid he must wait i said oh no said the thin man i thought you d finished with that i must go you can have my address no i said you must stay i think then they realized they were in real trouble i looked at the old man and i saw his eyes hood like a hawk i blew my whistle immediately the lights went out someone held me to my chair quickly franz somebody shouted in german the boat the boat i saw two policemen on the grass behind the house the thin dark man jumped through the window and was across the grass before anybody could stop him i was fighting the old man and more police came into the room i saw them holding the fat man but the thin man was at the top of the steps i waited holding the old man for the time it would take the thin man to get to the sea suddenly the old man escaped from me and ran to the wall of the room from underneath the ground i heard an explosion the cliff and the steps had been blown up the old man looked at me with wild crazy eyes he is safe he cried you cannot follow him the black stone has won this old man was more than just a paid spy those hooded eyes shone with a deep burning love for his country but as the police took him away i had one more thing to say your friend has not won we put our men on the ariadne an hour ago seven weeks later as all the world knows we went to war i joined the army in the first week but i did my best work i think before i put on uniform txtba www txtba com silas marner past and present in the early years of the nineteenth century strange looking little men were often seen on the country roads usually with a heavy bag on their shoulders they were linen weavers taking the linen they had woven to the women in the villages unlike the strong healthy country people they were small and thin with tired white faces bent backs and round shoulders they were often shortsighted too because they had to look so closely at their work to the villagers the weavers looked almost foreign and quite frightening where did they come from was it the devil who sent them who were their parents how could you trust a man if you didn t know his father or mother country people used to be very suspicious of all strangers and travellers they were also suspi cious of clever people people who could do something they themselves had not learnt to do that is why the linen weavers who often moved from towns to live and work in the country were considered strangers all their lives by their neighbours and were sometimes very lonely as a result silas marner was one of these weavers he lived in a small cottage near the village of raveloe every day he worked at his loom in the cottage the small boys of raveloe had never heard the sound of a loom before and sometimes they used to run up to his house to look quickly in at the window if silas noticed them he lifted his shortsighted eyes from the loom to stare at the boys there was something terrible about his stare which made the boys run away at once screaming with fear the vil lagers believed that silas had an almost devilish power which he could use to harm them if he wanted and so they were all afraid of him raveloe was an important looking village with a fine old church and a number of large farms but it was at least an hour away from any other village and very few strangers visited it which explains why the villagers opinions were so out of date silas marner had first come to raveloe fifteen years before as a young man he and his way of life seemed very strange to the villagers he worked long hours at his loom and had no friends or visitors from the village or anywhere else he never talked to his neighbours unless it was necessary for his work and he never looked at any of the raveloe girls who would want to marry him anyway the girls laughed to each other marry a dead man come to life again with that unhealthy white skin and those insect like eyes of his certainly not one of the villagers had had a strange experience with silas one evening he had discovered the weaver resting on a field gate his eyes open but unseeing and his body cold and hard like a dead man s after a few moments silas appeared to wake up said good night and walked away when this was discussed in the village some people thought that silas had had a fit but others like mr macey the church clerk refused to accept a medical explanation no he isn t ill that weaver said old mr macey shaking his head knowingly if he had a fit he d fall down wouldn t he i think his soul flies out of his body sometimes and that s why he looks so strange he doesn t come to church does he and how does he know so much about medicines you all re member how he made sally oates better when the doctor him self could do no more for her that s the devil s work believe me however the housewives needed silas to weave their linen and they could find nothing wrong with his work the years passed and raveloe villagers did not change their opinion of the weaver at the end of fifteen years they said exactly the same things about him but they believed them more strongly they also said that he had saved up a lot of money since he had come to raveloe silas had come from a large town to the north of raveloe here he had lived a very different life because he was one of a large number of weavers he was not considered strange and he belonged to an enthusiastic religious group they met every sunday at the chapel in light street once at a chapel meeting silas had become unconscious and had sat without moving hearing or seeing for over an hour this experience made him specially interesting to the rest of the group we should not call this strange unconsciousness a fit the minister mr paston told them no it s much more than that in that moment when he is absent from us our young friend silas s soul is open open to a possible message from god i believe he has been chosen by god silas s best friend at chapel was william dane a serious young man who was some people thought a little too sure of his own goodness and cleverness silas however could see no fault in him and trusted his friend completely they remained good friends when silas became engaged to a young woman sarah who belonged to the same chapel in fact silas was de lighted that sarah did not mind if william joined them some times on their sunday walks strangely when silas had his fit at the chapel meeting william was the only one who disagreed with the minister to me it looks more like the devil s work than god s william had said look deep into yourself friend silas is there any evil hiding in your soul silas was hurt that his friend doubted him and he began to be worried too about sarah she seemed to be showing signs of dislike towards him but when he asked her about it she did not give him any answer at that time one of the chapel leaders was dangerously ill and because he had no family some of the young men offered to sit with him at night one night silas was sitting alone at the old man s bedside time seemed to pass slowly in the quiet dark room but suddenly he realized that the man was no longer breathing he was dead strange thought silas his body s cold he s been dead for some time why did t i notice perhaps i ve had anoth er fit and it s already four o clock in the morning why hasn t william come he promised he d come at two o clock he hurried out of the house to call the doctor and the minister and then went to work as usual still wondering why william had not arrived but that evening after work william came to his room with the minister they were both looking very serious you must come to the chapel at once said mr paston but why asked silas looking unhappily at them you will hear when you get there was the only answer then in the chapel silas stood alone in front of all the peo ple who were once his friends the room was silent there was a pocket knife in the minister s hand where did you leave this knife he asked silas was trembling at this strange question i don t re member he answered silas silas you must confess cried the minister tell us the truth this knife your knife was found at the dead man s bedside and the bag of church money which i saw there myself only yesterday has gone silas did not speak for a moment then he said god knows i did not steal the money search my room you won t find the money i m not a thief you were the only one in our dead friend s house last night when the money was stolen said mr paston william tells us he was suddenly ill which prevented him from coming to take your place we will search your room and when they went to silas s room willia m fond the missing bag now empty under silas s bed silas my friend cried william confess your crime to us now send the devil away from your soul silas turned to the man he had always trusted william in the nine years since we ve been friends have i ever told you a lie but god will prove the truth as he looked at william he suddenly remembered something and reddened he said in a trembling voice the knife wasn t in my pocket last night i don t know what you mean replied william coldly in the strange little world of the light street chapel they did not believe in the law or judges they thought only god knew the answers so they agreed to draw lots to decide what had happened they all went down on their knees to ask for god s help in finding th truth silas knelt with them sure that god would prove his honesty there was silence as the minister took one of the papers out of the covered box the lots say that silas marner has stolen the money he said you will leave the chapel silas marner and you will not be accepted back until you confess your crime silas listened in horror at last he walked over to william dane and said firmly i lent you my knife you know that you stole the money while i was having a fit and you ve blamed me for it but perhaps you ll never be punished since there is no god who takes care of the good and punishes the bad only a god of lies you hear my friends said william smiling sadly this is the voice of the devil speaking silas went home the next day he sat alone for the whole day too miserable to do anything on the second day the min ister came to tell him that sarah had decided she could not marry him only a month later sarah married william dane and soon afterwards silas marner left the town at raveloe silas shut himself away in his cottage he did not want to think about the disaster he had experienced he could not understand why god had refused to help him but now that his trust in god and his friends had been broken he did not feel strong enough to build up that trust again in a new church and with new friends from now on he would live in a dark loveless hopeless world all that was left to him was his weaving and he sat at his loom seven days a week working all the daylight hours in the town he had earned less and had given much of his money to the chapel for the old the poor and the sick but now he be gan to earn more than ever before and there was no reason for him to give away any of it he was often paid for his linen in gold he discovered that he liked holding the shining coins in his hand and looking at their bright faces in his childhood silas had been taught by his mother to make simple medicines from wild flowers and plants one day he saw the shoemaker s wife sally oates sitting at her cottage door and he realized she had all the signs of the illness which had killed his mother he felt sorry for sally and although he knew he could not prevent her dying he prepared some medicine for her which made her feel much better the vil lagers considered this a good example of silas s strange fright ening power but as it had worked for sally they started visit ing silas to ask for help with their own illnesses but silas was too honest to take their money and give them useless medicine he knew he had no special power and so he sent them away the villagers believed he was refusing to help them and they were angry with him they blamed him for accidents that hap pened to them and deaths in the village so poor silas s kind ness to sally did not help him make friends in raveloe but little by little the piles of gold coins in his cottage grew higher the harder he worked the less he spent on himself he counted the coins into piles of ten and wanted to see them grow into a square and then into a larger square he was de lighted with every new coin but it made him want another his gold became a habit a delight a reason for living almost a reli gion he began to think the coins were his friends who made the cottage less lonely for him but it was only at night when he had finished his work that he spent time with them he kept them in two bags under the floorboards near the loom like a thirsty man who needs a drink he took them out every evening to look at them feel them and count them the coins shone in the firelight and silas loved every one of them when he looked at his loom he thought fondly of the half earned gold in the work he was doing and he looked forward to the years ahead of him the countless days of weaving and the growing piles of gold godfrey and dunstan cass the most important person in raveloe was squire cass a gentleman farmer who lived with his three sons in the handsome red house opposite the church and owned a num her of farms outside the village his wife had died many years before one dark november evening fifteen years after silas marner had first arrived in raveloe some of the villagers were drinking beer in the public house the rainbow old mr macey the church clerk was remembering the squire s wife she was a wonderful lady he said shaking his grey head sadly everything was always so pretty and clean at the red house when she was alive when she died all those years ago the poor squire well he didn t know what to do and he s still lonely believe me that s why we often see him in here in the evenings and another thing if poor mrs cass were alive today i m sure she d be very disappointed with her sons the squire should make those boys do some work but in stead he lets them stay at home and gives them money to spend on horses or gambling or women come come mr macey said the landlord they re rich young gentlemen after all you can t expect them to work on the farms like us country people but you re right about dun stan cass he s a bad one he is always borrowing money and never paying it back always gambling always in trouble he ll come to a bad end he will but the other two are different said the butcher a red faced smiling man bob cass is still only a boy and mr god frey the eldest well i don t believe he ll be like his brother dunstan just look at him he s got an open honest face and he s going to inherit the squire s money and all the land and what s more he s going to marry miss nancy lammeter when she moves into the red house as mrs godfrey cass she ll make life more comfortable for all the casses she ll save the squire money too the lammeters have the best of every thing in their house but they re very careful with their money the farrier a small man with a sharp face always enjoyed disagreeing with the butcher mr godfrey marry miss nancy he laughed that s what you think haven t you noticed how miss nancy has changed towards godfrey since last year you remember he was away from home for days and days nobody knows what he was doing but godfrey hasn t been the same since then miss nancy isn t stupid she won t marry a man she can t trust the landlord always tried to prevent his customers from ar guing what you all say is very true but let s hope that mr godfrey doesn t lose his chance of marrying miss nancy meanwhile at the red house godfrey cass was waiting for his brother in the sitting room with a very worried expression on his handsome face soon the door opened and a heavy look ing young man entered it was dunstan he had clearly been drinking how i hate him thought godfrey well sir said dunstan unpleasantly you sent for me and as you re the oldest and you ll be the squire one day i have to obey you so what do you want just listen will you replied godfrey angrily if you aren t too drunk to understand you must pay me back the money i lent you last month you know i got it from fowler of church farm he owed the money to the squire and asked me to give it to him now the squire is angry with fowler for not paying and i ve got to give the money back dunstan came close to godfrey and smiled in an evil way well my dear kind brother why don t you find the money yourself that would be much less trouble for me godfrey controlled himself with difficulty don t smile at me like that or i ll hit you oh no you won t answered dunstan because if you do i ll tell the squire your secret i ll tell him that his handsome eldest son fell in love with that poor girl molly in the town and married her in a hurry the squire ll be angry because you married her in secret and he ll disinherit you then i ll get the house and land when the old man dies but don t worry i m a good brother to you i won t tell him and you ll find the money to pay back i know you will where can i get the money from cried godfrey i tell you i haven t got any you could borrow it said dunstan carelessly or wait i ve had a better idea you could sell your horse sell wildfire you know how muchl love that horse well you could ride him to the hunt tomorrow i know two or three men who d be interested in buying him and they ll be at the hunt i m sure it d be easy no i haven t got time to go hunting tomorrow i i m going to mrs osgood s birthday dance aha said dunstan laughing and perhaps you ll see sweet miss nancy there and you ll dance with her and you ll talk of love be quiet shouted godfrey his face turning red don t speak of miss nancy like that or i ll kill you don t get so angry brother answered dunstan calmly you ve got a very good chance with her in fact i advise you to be nice to her you and i know that molly s started drink ing well if she drinks too much one day and dies then you could marry nancy she wouldn t mind being a second wife if she didn t know there was a first and luckily you ve got a kind brother who ll keep your secret well godfrey s face was white now and he was trembling look dunstan i ve nearly had enough of this you can push a man too far you know perhaps i ll go to the squire now and confess everything to him he ll discover the truth one day because molly says she ll come and tell him she wants every one to know we re married when the squire knows the truth you won t get any more money from me dunstan replied lightly do what you like brother godfrey hesitated he knew he had fallen into dunstan s trap when he made the mistake of marrying molly it was dunstan who had introduced his brother to molly hoping that godfrey would fall in love and marry her dunstan was clearly delighted that his evil plan had succeeded godfrey was now in a difficult situation he no longer loved his young wife and could not stop thinking of nancy lammeter he felt sure that with nancy as his wife he would not need to have secrets and could be open and honest with everybody but for the moment he had to give dunstan whatever he wanted keep molly happy and lie to his father and his friends if he told his father the truth the situation would become impossible the squire would disinherit him and he would be just a poor working man for the rest of his life and far worse than that he would lose any hope of marrying nancy no he could not accept that he would find the money for dunstan and wait for the situa tion to get better living with fear in his heart the fear of be ing discovered was better than living without nancy s love he turned to dunstan it s just like you to talk of selling wildfire the best horse i ve ever had let me sell him for you you know i m good at buying and selling i can ride him to the hunt for you tomorrow and bring you back the money but you must decide you lent me that money and you ll have to pay it back to the squire so it s your problem not mine godfrey thought for a moment all right he said but make sure you bring me back all the money dunstan the next morning as dunstan was riding wildfire out of rav eloe he passed the old quarry all the stone had been taken out of it and it was no longer used now all that was left was a deep hole full of reddish water opposite the quarry was silas marn er s cottage dunstan suddenly had an idea everybody in raveloe talks of the weaver s money he must have a lot hid den away in that cottage why doesn t godfrey borrow some money from him and pay him back when he becomes the squire he wondered whether to go back to the red house at once to tell godfrey about this wonderful idea of his but he did not want to miss the hunt so he decided to continue on his way at the hunt he met several friends and neighbours and be fore the hunt started he managed to sell wildfire for a good price the money would be paid when he brought the horse to the neighbour s house later that day dunstan knew it would be safer to take the horse there immediately so that he could be sure of receiving the money but he was confident that he could take care of wildfire during the hunt and so after a glass or two of whisky he joined the other riders in the fields this time however he was not as lucky as usual and horse and rid er fell while jumping a gate dunstan got up shaken but unhurt but poor wildfire s back was broken and in a few mo ments he died dunstan looked around and was glad to see that no other riders had noticed his accident he did not want people to think he was a bad rider he did not care much about wildfire be cause he thought he now had a much better plan to offer god frey the worst thing was that he would have to walk home something he was not at all used to doing he drank some more whisky from the bottle he kept in his pocket and started down the country road he kept thinking about silas s money there would certainly be enough for his own needs as well as godfrey s dunstan thought it would be easy to frighten the weaver a little and then silas would quick ly agree to lend his money it was four o clock in the afternoon and the whole country side was covered by a thick mist dunstan did not see anyone on his way back to raveloe he knew he was getting close to the old quarry although he could not see the road in front of him at last he saw light coming from the weaver s cottage and he decided to knock at the door why not ask the old man for the money now he thought but when he knocked loudly there was no reply and when he pushed the door it opened dunstan found himself in front of a bright fire which showed every corner of the small living room silas marner was not there dunstan was tired and cold so he went quickly to sit by the warm fire as he sat down he noticed a small piece of meat cooking over the fire it was hanging from a large door key so the old man s cooking meat for his supper is he thought dunstan but where is he why is his door unlocked perhaps he went out to fetch some wood for the fire and fell into the quarry perhaps he s dead this was an interesting new idea and if he s dead who inherits his mon ey who would know that anybody had come to take it away and the most important question of all where is the money dunstan s excitement made him forget that the weaver could still be alive he wanted silas to be dead and he wanted silas s money he looked round the cottage again there was very little furniture just a bed the loom three chairs and a table dunstan looked under the bed but the money was not there then he noticed a plsce on the floor near the loom where the floorboards looked different by pulling up one of the boards he discovered silas s hiding place he took out the two heavy bags filled with gold put the boards back and hurried to the door outside the rain was falling heavily and he could not see anything at all carrying the heavy bags he stepped forward into the darkness where is silas s gold when dunstan cass left the cottage silas marner was only a hundred metres away he was walking home from the village where he had gone to buy what he needed for his next day s work his legs were tired but he felt almost happy he was looking forward to supper time when he would bring out his gold tonight he had an extra reason to hurry home he was going to eat hot meat which was unusual for him and it would cost him nothing because someone had giv en him a piece of meat as a present he had left it cooking over the fire the door key was needed to hold it safely in place but silas was not at all worried about leaving his gold in the cot tage with the door unlocked he could not imagine that a thief would find his way through the mist rain and darkness to the little cottage by the quarry when he reached his cottage and opened the door he did not notice that anything was different he threw off his wet coat and pushed the meat closer to the fire as soon as he was warm again he began to think about his gold it seemed a long time to wait until after supper when he usually brought out the coins to look at so he decided to bring out his gold immediate ly while the meat was still cooking but when he took up the floorboards near the loom and saw the empty hole he did not understand at once his heart beat violently as his trembling hands felt all round the hole there was nothing there he put his hands to his head and tried to think had he put his gold in a different place and forgotten about it he searched every corner of his small cottage until he could not pretend to himself any more he had to accept the truth his gold had been stolen he gave a wild desperate scream and stood still for a mo ment then he turned towards his loom and almost fell into the seat where he always worked he touched the loom to make sure it too had not been stolen now he was beginning to think more clearly a thief has been here if i can find him he ll have to give back my gold but i was only away for a short time and there s no sign of anyone entering the cottage he wondered whether it was really a thief who had taken his money or whether it was the same cruel god who had already destroyed his happiness once but silas preferred to suspect a thief who would perhaps return the money he began to think it must be jem rodney a local poacher who had known about silas s money and who sometimes visited the cottage silas felt stronger now that he thought he knew the thief i must go and tell the squire and the police he said to himself they ll make jem give me back the money so he hurried out in the rain without a coat and ran towards the rainbow he thought he would find the most important people in rav eloe at the public house but in fact most of them were at mrs osgood s birthday dance there were however five villagers at the rainbow enjoying an interesting conversation about ghosts while drinking their beer i tell you people have seen ghosts the butcher said and i ll tell you where too behind the church that s right agreed old mr macey you young ones aren t old enough to remember but people have seen ghosts near the church since i was a boy oh yes it s true the farrier laughed scornfully ghosts people imagine they see things on a dark night you can t make me believe in ghosts it s a question of fact there are no ghosts now now began the lanalord who always tried to keep the peace in some ways you re all wrong and in some ways you re all right that s my opinion there are ghosts and there aren t well that s what people say and just then silas s white face appeared suddenly in the door way he had run all the way from his cottage so he could not speak for a moment he stared silently at the men with his strange staring eyes looking exactly like a ghost for a few minutes nobody said anything while silas tried to control his breathing then the landlord spoke what do you want master marner come tell us robbed cried silas suddenly able to speak i ve been robbed i want the police and the squire he waved his arms wildly as he spoke hold him jem said the landlord to the poacher who was sitting near the door i think he s gone mad but jem moved quickly away not me he replied i don t want anything to do with a ghost jem rodney cried silas turning and staring at the man he suspected yes master marner answered jem trembling a little if it was you who stole my money said silas going close to jem just give it back to me and i won t tell the police please just give it back stole your money cried jem angrily i ll throw this glass at you if you accuse me of stealing your money come now master matner said the landlord firmly tak ing silas by the arm you must explain what you mean if you want us to believe you and sit down by the fire to dry your clothes you re very wet that s right said the farrier no more staring like a madman that s what i thought you were at first not a ghost of course the weaver sat down in the centre of the little group of men and told his story it felt strange but pleasant to him to talk to his neighbours and tell them his problems the men re alized at once that silas was telling the truth they had sus pected him of working for the devil but they knew now that the devil was no longer taking care of him well master marner said the landlord in the end you mustn t accuse poor jem he sometimes steals a chicken we all know that but he s been sitting here drinking with us all evening so he s not the thief that s right said old mr macey you can t accuse someone who hasn t done anything wrong master marner these words brought the past back to silas and he remem bered standing in front of his accusers in the light street chapel he went up to jem i was wrong he said miserably i m sorry jem i had no reason to accuse you but where can my gold be perhaps some stranger came to your cottage while you were out said the farrier but we must report the robbery to the police and the squire immediately next morning when the whole village heard about the stolen gold they all discussed it excitedly a few people still did not trust silas or believe his story most people however were suspicious of the pedlar who had visited raveloe the month be fore perhaps he had returned to hide near the quarry and steal the money when silas left his cottage several villagers thought they remembered his evil looking face and felt sure he was not honest silas himself remembered that the pedlar had come to his cottage door recently he hoped the pedlar was indeed the thief because the police could catch him and make him give back the money his home seemed very empty to him without his gold and he desperately wanted to get it back godfrey is in trouble godfrey was not very surprised to find that dunstan had not come home after his day s hunting perhaps he was staying the night at a public house but when dunstan did not return home the next day godfrey began to worry about wild fire he did not trust his brother and wondered if dunstan had gone away to spend the money on gambling so he decided to go to look for him on the road near raveloe he met his neigh bour john bryce who had arranged to buy wildfire from dun stan well godfrey said bryce did your brother tell you about the horse what do you mean john replied godfrey quickly no he hasn t been home yet what s happened to my horse ah so he was yours was he dunstan told me you d giv en him wildfire i was going to buy him you know what s dunstan done is wildfire hurt asked godfrey crossly worse than that answered bryce i m afraid your horse is dead we ve only just found him your brother rode him to the hunt and the horse fell at a gate and broke his back so you haven t seen dunstan since yesterday no and he d better not come home now replied godfrey angrily how stupid i was to trust him with my horse but where can dunstan be i suppose he wasn t hurt be cause we didn t find him near the horse him said godfrey bitterly oh he ll be all right he ll never be hurt he only ever hurts other people we ll hear of him soon enough don t worry bryce said goodbye and rode away godfrey rode slowly back into raveloe thinking about what he would very soon have to do there was no longer any escape he must confess the whole truth to his father for the rest of the day he planned what he would say he would explain that he had lent fowler s money to dunstan because dunstan knew his secret that would be the right moment to tell the squire about his secret marriage to molly but he ll be very angry thought godfrey and when he s angry with people he just wants to punish them he won t listen or calm down but perhaps he ll keep my se cret he s so proud of the family name and if he disinherited me everyone would talk about it when he went to bed that night godfrey thought he had decided what to say but when he woke up in the morning he could not see any reason to confess to the marriage why should he lose the chance of marrying nancy why should he tell the whole truth now when perhaps it was not necessary no it would be better to go on in the same way as before per haps dunstan would stay away for a while and then there would be no need to tell his father about molly but today i ll tell the squire about the money he thought he ll have to know about that godfrey was already in the dining room when his father ar rived for breakfast the squire sat down at the head of the table and ordered the servant to bring him some beer haven t you had breakfast yet godfrey he asked yes i have sir replied godfrey but i was waiting to speak to you well you young people have plenty of time answered the squire we older ones have to do all the work godfrey looked straight at his father sir he said bravely i must tell you something very unfortunate has happened to wildfire what has he broken a leg i thought you could ride bet ter than that well you can t expect me to pay for a new horse i m very short of money at the moment and i m angry with fowler he still hasn t paid me what he owes me if he doesn t pay today he ll go to prison the squire s face was red and he banged angrily on the table as he spoke it s worse than breaking a leg continued godfrey miser ably wildfire s dead but i don t want you to buy me anoth er horse i just feel sorry i can t pay you you see sir the truth is i m very sorry fowler did pay the money he gave it to me and i was stupid enough to let dunstan have it and he was going to sell wildfire and then i was going to repay you the money the squire s face was purple now and for a moment he could not speak you you let dunstan have my money why did you give it to him and why did he want it where s dunstan now he ll answer my questions or leave this house go and fetch him at once dunstan hasn t come home sir the horse was found dead and nobody knows where dunstan is well why did you let him have my money answer me said the squire staring angrily at godfrey well sir i don t know replied godfrey hesitating he was not good at lying and was not prepared for his father s questions you don t know the squire repeated scornfully well i know why i think you ve done something wrong and you ve bribed dunstan to keep it a secret that s it isn t it the squire had made a very clever guess and godfrey s heart banged in sudden alarm he was not ready to confess ev erything yet well sir he said trying to speak carelessly it was just a little business between dunstan and me you wouldn t be interested in it you know how old are you now twenty six asked the squire an grily old enough to look after your money and mine too i ve been much too generous to you boys but i m going to be harder on you all from now on you ve got a weak character godfrey like your poor mother i think you need a wife who knows what she wants because you can t decide anything by yourself when you were thinking of marrying nancy lammeter i agreed didn t i have you asked her or not she hasn t refused to marry you has she no i haven t asked her said godfrey feeling very hot ad uncomfortable but i don t think she ll accept me don t be stupid godfrey said the sqiuire with a scornful laugh any woman would want to marry into our family do you want to marry her there s no other woman i want to marry said godfrey avoiding his father s eyes well then let me speak to her father for you since you aren t brave enough to do it yourself she s a pretty girl and intelligent no sir please don t say anything at the moment said godfrey quickly i must ask her myself well ask her then when you marry her you ll have to forget about horses and so on it ll be good for you to do some serious work you should get married soon please don t try to hurry things sir begged godfrey i ll do what i like said the squire firmly and if you don t do what i want i ll disinherit you and you can leave the house now if you know where dunstan s hiding i expect you do tell him he needn t come home he ll pay for his own food from now on i don t know where he is sir anyway it s you who should tell him to leave home don t argue with me godfrey said the squire turning back to his breakfast just go and tell the servants to get my horse ready godfrey left the room he was relieved that his father had not discovered the whole truth however he was a little wor ried that the squire would try to arrange his marriage with nancy while he was married to molly he could not marry nancy although it was his dearest wish but as usual he was waiting and hoping for some unexpected change in his situation which would save him from any unpleasantness silas s neighbours in the weeks following the robbery the police tried hard to find the pedlar because so many people suspected him of being the thief but there was no sign of him in any of the towns and villages round raveloe nobody was surprised at dunstan cass s absence once be fore he had stayed away for six weeks and then come back no body imagined he could have anything to do with the robbery the villagers continued to discuss silas and his lost gold but they had no more explanations to offer silas himself still had his loom and his work so he went on weaving but the only thing that had made his life worth living had gone and now he had nothing to look forward to a life time of empty evenings lay ahead of him he did not enjoy thinking of the money he would earn because it reminded him of the money he had lost as he sat weaving he sometimes used to moan quietly to himself and in the evenings as he sat alone in front of the fire he used to put his head in his hands and moan again but this disaster had one good result little by little silas s neighbours realized it was wrong to be suspicious of him he was just a poor simple harmless man who needed their help they showed their new opinion of him in many different ways some of the women who were baking cakes and preparing meat for christmas brought him presents of food some of the men who had nothing to give him stopped him in the village to ask about his health or visited him to discuss the robbery they often finished their conversation by saying cheerfully now you re the same as the rest of us we re poor too cheer up master marner if you get ill and can t work any more the squire ll give you food and your neigh bours will take care of you this did not make silas feel better but he realized it was meant kindly old mr macey the church clerk came to the cottage one day to explain how his opinion of the weaver had changed you see master marner he said in his high old voice i used to think you worked for the devil you ve always looked strange you know but now i m sure you re not evil just a lit tle bit crazy that s what i tell the neighbours he stopped to give silas time to reply but the weaver did not speak he was sitting with his head in his hands as usual he knew that the old man was trying to be kind but he was too miserable to show any interest come master marner what s your answer to that asked mr macey a little impatiently oh said silas slowly lifting his head thank you thank you for your kindness that s all right replied the old man pleased now you shouldn t sit here moaning you know here s my advice to you ask tookey in the village to make you a sunday suit i don t expect you ve got one and then you can come to church with your neighbours it ll make you feel better you re not an old man yet although you look like one how old were you when you came here first twenty five i don t remember answered silas shaking his head that evening mr macey told a number of villagers at the rainbow poor master doesn t know how old he is and i don t suppose he knows what day of the week it is he really is a bit crazy another villager dolly winthrop was also worried about silas s absence from church she was a large fresh faced wom an with a sweet patient smile who was always busy from early morning until late at night and who went to church herself ev ery sunday she believed in helping her neighbours and if someone in raveloe was ill or dying dolly was often asked to take care of the patient this good sensible woman decided that silas needed her help so one sunday afternoon she took her son aaron a pretty little boy of seven to visit the weaver as they came closer to the cottage they heard the sound of the loom oh dear working on a sunday that s bad said mrs winthrop sadly she had to knock loudy on the door before silas heard he said nothing but opened the door to let them in and dolly sat down in an armchair i was baking yesterday master marner she said and i ve brought you some of my cakes here they are thank you replied silas taking the little bag of cakes dolly was holding out to him aaron was hiding behind his mother s chair in childish fear of the weaver you didn t hear the church bells this morning perhaps master marner dolly asked gently this cottage is a long way from the village yes i heard them answered silas for him sunday bells did not mean anything there had been no bells at the light street chapel oh said dolly but but do you have to work on a sun day you could make sunday different from the other days you know by washing yourself and cooking a little piece of meat and going to church and master marner christmas day will be here soon if you put on your best clothes and go to church and see the flowers and hear the singing you ll feel much better you ll know there is someone you can trust dolly did not usually talk so much but the matter seemed extremely important to her no no silas replied i don t know anything about church i ve never been to church never been repeated dolly were there no churches in the town you were born in oh yes said silas there were a lot of churches it was a big town you see but i only ever went to chapel dolly did not understand this word but was afraid of asking any more questions in case chapel meant something evil after considering carefully for a moment she said well master marner it s never too late to start going to church it s very pleasant listening to the singing and the good words if we go to church rhen when trouble comes someone will take care of us and if we do our best then i believe someone will help us when we need help dolly s explanation of her simple religion did not seem at all clear to silas but he did understand that she was asking him to go to church he did not want to agree to that just then young aaron came out from behind his mother s chair and silas of fered him one of dolly s cakes oh aaron said his mother you re always eating no don t give him any more master marner but he can sing a song for you i m sure you ll like it it s a beautiful christmas carol come aaron let s hear it little aaron stood up straight and sang his carol in a clear sweet voice dolly listened with delight hoping that the carol would help to persuade silas to come to church you see master marner she said when aaron had fin ished that s christmas music the christmas day service is wonderful with all the voices and the music i hope you ll be there with us and remember if you feel ill i ll be happy to come and cook or clean for you but i beg you please stop weaving on sundays it s bad for soul and body i m sure we must go now goodbye master marner thank you and goodbye said silas as he opened the door for them he could not help feeling relieved when she had gone now he could weave and moan as much as he liked mr macey and dolly had tried hard to persuade silas to go to church but in the end he spent christmas day alone in his cot tage looking out at the cold grey sky in the evening snow be gan to fall and he felt more distant and separate from his neighbours than ever he sat in his robbed home moaning mis erably to himself not noticing that his fire was no longer burn ing and that he was getting cold but in raveloe the church bells were ringing and the church was fuller than all through the rest of the year it was a special day for everybody and after the service they all hurried home in the biting cold to eat and drink with their families at the red house nobody spoke of dunstan s absence the village doctor dr kimble and his wife were guests there for christmas lunch and the day passed happily the servants however were already preparing for the new year s eve dance which squire cass gave every year it was the best party of the year and guests used to come from miles around godfrey was looking forward to this year s party more than usual but he was still worried what if dunstan returns he thought he ll tell the squire about my secret marriage and molly s asking for more money i ll have to sell something for cash but on new year s eve i can forget everything for an evening and sit with nancy and look into her eyes and dance with her the new year s eve dance on december lst it was snowing and very cold all day there were ladies and gentlemen arriving at the red house godfrey cass was waiting at the door for the only guest he cared about nancy lammeter finally she arrived sitting be hind her father on his horse looking more beautiful than ever her lovely face blushed as she saw godfrey come forward to lift her down from the horse why is he waiting for me she thought i thought i made it clear to him that i ll never mar ry him people say he leads a bad life and i can t marry a man like that but the squire appeared just then to welcome his guests and in the excitement nobody noticed nancy s pink face as godfrey s strong arms lifted her down she hurried into the house with the other ladies to change her clothes the house was full of servants running here and there mrs kimble who always helped the squire arrange these parties was giving orders in a loud voice cooks were preparing food in the kitchens and there was already a wonderful smell of baking in the air upstairs the ladies were excitedly putting on their best dresses while talking to each other all the time nancy met her aunt mrs osgood who introduced her to some visitors of hers the misses gunn were two young ladies who were not beauti ful but dressed very fashionably just then nancy s older sister priscilla arrived she was a large cheerful girl with a round face and a nose pink with cold as they were changing their clothes priscilla said to mrs osgood look at our dresses aunt of course nancy looks beautiful in hers but this colour makes me look yellow nan cy says we must wear the same dresses because we re sisters although i m five years older i m ugly i know i am but i don t mind she turned to mrs osgood s two visitors in my opinion the pretty girls are useful i m sure you agree to catch the men i don t think men are worth worrying about any woman with a good father and a good home had better stay single that s what i m going to do anyway we ugly girls don t need husbands mrs osgood stood up and said quickly my visitors and i should go downstairs now priscilla and nancy we ll see you later and the three ladies hurried out oh really priscilla cried nancy when they were alone you never think before you speak i m sure the misses gunn thought you were very impolite you almost told them they were ugly did i asked priscilla in surprise well that s the way i am i always tell the truth but i m the ugly one just look at me priscilla you know i asked you to choose the dresses replied nancy worriedly i don t mind what colour i wear you look lovely in this colour dear child you know you always have whatever you want in the end although you never give orders or shout about it i m looking forward to seeing you married it ll be fun watching you make your husband do exactly what you want don t say that answered nancy blushing you know i m never going to get married priscilla laughed i m the one who ll stay single and if you don t like godfrey cass well there are plenty of other young men come let s go downstairs now although priscilla was right in saying she was not good looking she was very popular among her neighbours because she was so cheerful and sensible and nancy was not only con sidered to be the most beautiful girl in and around raveloe but also one of the most intelligent seats at the dining table had been kept for the lammeter sisters priscilla was taken to sit between her father and the squire nancy felt herself blushing again as godfrey cass came to lead her to a seat between himself and the vicar mr crack enthorp she knew that if she married godfrey she would one day be the most important woman in raveloe the squire s wife but she repeated firmly to herself that she could not mar ry a man of bad character as she sat down the vicar who was always polite to ladies said with a smile ah miss nancy you re looking lovely this evening isn t she go dfrey godfrey made no reply and avoided looking at nancy there was too much he wanted to say to her but the squire who al ways enjoyed his parties and was feeling extremely cheerful was rather impatient with his son he thought he had better speak if godfrey was too shy to do it himself that s right the squire said loudly when i look at miss nancy here i think she s more beautiful than any girl i ve ev er seen while they were eating and drinking people around the table were listening with interest to the squire s words per haps godfrey will marry nancy after all the vicar s wife whispered to mrs osgood mr lammeter s back was very straight as he looked across the table at his daughter he was a serious careful gentleman who considered the lammeters a better family than the casses he had already decided that godfrey must change his way of life before nancy could possi bly marry him just then dr kimble called across the table miss nancy will you save a dance for me come come kimble said the squire let the young ones enjoy themselves my son godfrey ll be angry if you take miss nancy away i expect he s asked her for the first dance already haven t you godfrey godfrey was feeling very uncomfortable by now turning to nancy he said as lightly as possible i haven t asked her yet but i hope she ll agree if nobody s asked her no i haven t accapted anyone else replied nancy quietly with a blush so will you please have the first dance with me asked godfrey beginning to feel better she had not refused him i will answered nancy coldly she was still sure she would not marry him but she wanted to remain polite ah well you re a lucky man godfrey said dr kimble with a laugh i think i can hear the music starting now the guests got up from the table in pairs and small groups to move into the large hall where the dancing was about to start the small village band was already playing as the squire led the vicar s wife to the end of the hall to start the dance they were followed by godfrey and nancy and the other ladies and gentlemen as the dance went on godfrey felt happier and happier holding nancy in his arms he forgot all his problems sudden ly the squire s heavy foot stood on part of nancy s dress and some of the material was pulled away at the waist nancy asked godfrey to take her to a quieter place where she could repair the damage he took her to a small room near the hall hoping they would have a few private moments together but nancy sat down on the chair furthest away from him and said coldly thank you sir you needn t stay i m very sorry about taking you away from the dance it s not very kind of you said godfrey moving close to her to be sorry you ve danced with me i didn t mean that replied nancy blushing prettily gentlemen have so many things to enjoy i m sure one dance can t matter very much you know that isn t true you know one dance with you means more to me than anything else in the world nancy was a little surprised godfrey had not said anything like this to her for a long time she replied firmly i m afraid i can t believe you mr godrey nancy if i changed my life would you think better of me would you like me then godfrey knew these were danger ous words but the sudden chance of speaking to her alone made him say more than he had planned i d be glad to see a good change in anybody sir you re very hard nancy said godfrey bitterly you could help me to be better i m very miserable but you don t feel anything i think people who behave badly don t feel anything said nancy sharply forgetting to be cool and distant godfrey was delighted he wanted to make her argue with him to show him that she cared about him but just then priscilla hurried in saying dear child let me look at your dress i saw the squire step on it during the dance i suppose i d better go now godfrey said disappointedly to priscilla it doesn t matter at all to me whether you go or stay said priscilla impatiently looking closely at the waist of nancy s dress do you want me to go godfrey asked nancy do whatever you like replied nancy trying to sound cold again well i want to stay answered godfrey and sat down tonight he wanted to enjoy being with nancy for as long as possible without thinking about what would happen tomorrow silas finds his gold but while godfrey cass was managing to forget his prob lems by the lovely nancy s side his wife was walking with slow uncertain steps along the snow coverea road to ray eloe she was carrying her sleeping child in her arms for some time now she had planned to come to raveloe on new year s eve she knew that her husband would be at the centre of a happy smiling group of friends and she had chosen this moment to appear in front of all his family and guests at the red house dance i don t care if godfrey is ashamed of mes she thought bitterly i want people to know we re mar ried sometimes she hated her husband because he was still handsome and had money while she was no longer pretty and very poor she blamed him for her miserable life but in her heart she knew she should blame her drinking it had become a habit wiht her to spend most of the money godfrey gave her on gin she had a bottle in her pocket now which she had lifted to her lips several times during her journey it was already seven o clock in the evening and there was a freezing wind molly did not know she was very near raveloe her legs were tired and the gin was beginning to make her feel sleepy she thought she would rest for a while and still hold ing her child she lay down on the snow she did not notice that the ground was cold in a few moments the child woke up crying mummy but the mother did not seem to hear suddenly as the child fell gently out of its mother s arms on to the soft snow it noticed a bright dancing light on the white ground interested the child stood up to see where the brightness came from and followed the light to an open door the door of silas marner s cottage the little one toddled right in through the door and sat down by the bright fire after a few minutes the child felt pleasantly warm and fell asleep but where was silas while this was happening in the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out he had some idea that his money would come back or that some one would come with information about the thief tonight was new year s eve and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year so tonight he was more restless than usual he opened his door several times during the evening and stared out but he saw and heard nothing in the silent freezing night the last time as he was standing at the door he had one of his fits and stood there completely uncon scions holding the door open when he became conscious again he closed the door and turned back to the fire but when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire he seemed to see gold there gold his own gold taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way his heart beat excitedly and for a few moments he was unable to move at last he reached out his hand to touch the gold but instead of hard metal coins his fin gers felt soft warm curls with great surprise silas fell on his knees to look at this wonderful thing it was a sleeping child was he dreaming could it be his little sister who had died when he was a child himself if it wasn t a dream how had the child entered the cottage but thinking of his sister made him remember the past and his life at the light street chapel he wondered if this child was some kind of message from his past sent perhaps by the god he had once trusted just then the child woke up and began to cry silas held it in his arms and spoke softly to quieten it he remembered that he had made some porridge earlier and gave a little to the child to eat she stopped crying and lifted her blue eyes with a smile to silas s face as she ate but then she pulled at her wet shoes trying to take them off and silas suddenly realized she had come to the cottage through the snow so he picked her up and went to the door as he opened it and went out into the dark the child cried mummy and reached forward almost jump ing out of his arms a few steps away silas found a young woman s body half covered with snow at the red house everybody was enjoying the party some people were still eating while others were dancing or playing cards godfrey was looking forward to his next dance with nancy he was watching her dreamily across the room when suddenly he saw something that made his lips go white and his whole body tremble it was his own child carried in silas marner s arms the weaver had come straight into the hall where the dancing was going on several people turned to look at the strange figure in the doorway the squire could not understand why sllas had come in uninvited he stood up and asked angrily marner what are you doing here i ve come for the doctor replied silas hurriedly there s a woman dead i think near my cottage godfrey had one great fear at that moment that the woman was not dead if she were his wife and she were dead he would be free to marry nancy while the squire was calling for dr kimble the ladies came closer to look at the pretty child whose child is it one of them asked i don t know replied godfrey wildly some poor woman s she s been found in the snow i think you d better leave the poor child here with us then master marner offered mrs kimble kindly no i can t let it go said silas unexpectedly it s come to me i don t know where from i want to keep it well said mrs kimble surprised a single man like you take care of a child well but the little one was holding on to silas and smiling up at him confidently dr kimble hurried into the hall where is this poor woman near the old quarry someone had better fetch dolly winthrop i ll need her to help me i ll go cried godfrey he wanted to get away before any one noticed his white face and shaking hands and he needed time to think he ran out into the night when he and dolly arrived at the quarry the doctor had moved the woman into silas s cottage and godfrey had to wait outside he walked up and down in the snow for what seemed like hours he knew he should tell the truth about the woman and the child but he could not make himself do what he knew was right is she dead the voice inside his head asked if she is i can marry nancy and then i ll be good and have no more secrets and i ll make sure the child is taken care of of course when dr kimble came out of the cottage godfrey tried to speak calmly i thought i d wait to see he began oh there was no need for you to come why didn t you send one of the men to fetch dolly the woman s dead i m afraid she s very thin and looks very poor but she s got a wedding ring on she ll be buried tomorrow i ll just have a look at her said godfrey quickly i think i saw a woman on the road yesterday with a child perhaps it was her and he ran into the cottage there on the bed was his unloved wife he only looked at her for a moment but for the rest of his life he never forgot her sad tired face the weaver had come back with the doctor and was sitting by the fire with the child on his knees the little one was awake but her wide open blue eyes looked up into godfrey s face without recognizing him at all the father was glad of this but also a little sad especially when he saw the small hand pull lovingly at the weaver s grey hair so who s going to take care of the child godfrey asked pretending not to show much interest i am replied silas firmly the mother s dead and i sup pose the child hasn t got a father she s alone in the world and so am i my money s gone i don t know where and she s come i don t know where from i don t understand it at all but i m going to keep her poor little thing said godfrey let me give you some thing for her clothes he put his hand in his pocket and gave silas some coins as he walked back to the red house he felt very relieved nobody would recognize his dead wife and soon his secret would be buried with her now he could talk of love to nancy he could promise to be a good husband to her only dunstan knew about the secret marriage and perhaps dunstan would never come home what a good thing i didn t confess every thing to the squire he thought now i can make nancy and myself happy and the child well it won t matter to her whether i m her father or not that week the dead woman was buried in raveloe and the child stayed at the weaver s cottage the villagers were very surprised that silas had decided to keep her but they liked him for wanting to help an orphan the women especially were very ready to give him useful advice on taking care of children dolly winthrop came every day to help silas it s no trou ble she said i get up early so i ve got plenty of time and i can bring you some of aaron s old baby clothes so you won t need to spend a lot of money on the child i can wash her and give her food and ye es said silas hesitating he was looking a little jeal ously at the baby in dolly s arms that s very kind of you but but i want to do everything for her myself i want her to be fond of me she s my child don t worry said dolly gently giving him the child look she loves you the best see she s smiling at you and so silas learnt how to take care of the little girl he called her eppie which had been his little sister s name his life was quite different now when he was working and living only for his gold he had not been interested in the world outside his cottage or the people he sometimes met but now that he had another reason for living he had to look outward he spent hours in the fields with eppie happily rediscovering the plants he used to know so well together they visited his neighbours who were always delighted to see him and his adopted child his days and evenings were full taking care of a trusting lov ing child godfrey cass watched the little girl growing up with great interest during eppie s childhood he often gave money to silas to spend on her but was careful that nobody should suspect him of being her father his life was also changing there was a new firmness about him which everyone noticed he was looking forward to marrying nancy very soon nancy and i will have children he thought happily but i won t forget that other child eppie has grown up it was a bright autumn sunday sixteen years after silas had found eppie in his cottage the raveloe church bells were ringing and people were coming out of church after the morning service first came the new squire godfrey cass looking a little heavier now but with a straight back and a firm step on his arm was his wife nancy still a pretty woman just behind them came mr lammeter and priscilla they all went into the red house you and priscilla will stay for tea won t you nancy asked her father my dear you must ask priscilla replied mr lammeter with a smile she manages me and the farm as well well it s better for your health if i manage everything fa ther said priscilla then there s nothing for you to worry about no nancy dear we must go home now but you and i can have a walk round the garden while the servants are get ting the horses ready when the sisters were alone in the garden priscilla said my dear i m very glad you re going to have a dairy making your own butter will give you something to think about all the time you ll never be sad when you ve got a dairy and she put her arm through her sister s dear priscilla said nancy gratefully i m only ever sad when godfrey is i could be happy if he could accept our life as it is but it s more difficult for a man men cried priscilla impatiently they re always wanting something new never happy with what they ve got i m glad i was too ugly to get married i m much happier with fa ther oh priscilla said nancy don t be angry with godfrey he s a very good husband but of course he s disappointed that we haven t had children he wanted them so much well father is waiting for me i d better go now goodbye my dear and the sisters kissed goodbye when priscilla and her father had left godfrey said nancy i think i ll just go and look at some of the fields we re draining near the old quarry you ll be back by tea time dear oh yes i ll be back in an hour this was a habit of godfrey s on sunday afternoons he en joyed walking round the fields that belonged to him now so nancy often had a quiet hour at about this time which she spent reading or sometimes just thinking she remembered all the little things that had happened to her especially during her marriage in the last fifteen years the great sadness of her married life had been the death of her only baby like most women she had looked forward to be coming a mother very much but when the baby died soon af ter it was born she made herself accept the fact she did not allow herself to think about it or to wish for anything different godfrey however had been terribly disappointed es pecially when it seemed likely that nancy could have no more children nancy s religion was extremely important to her she firmly believed that people should accept whatever happened to them in life because it was god who decided everything but she un derstood how difficult it was for godfrey to accept that their marriage would be childless was i right she wondered for the hundredth time to refuse him when he said we should adopt a child i believe that if god hasn t given us a child it s because god doesn t want us to have one i m sure i m right but poor godfrey it s worse for him than for me i ve got him and the house and now the dairy to think about but although he s always good to me i know he s unhappy he wants children so much from the first moment godfrey had spoken of adopting a child he had mentioned eppie s name she had always been the child he wanted to adopt he had no idea that silas would rather die than lose eppie and he imagined that the weaver would be glad if the child were adopted by the cass family after all the girl will have a much better life with us he told himself i can t be really happy if we don t have a child and i can never tell nancy the truth about eppie i m afraid she ll hate me for it while nancy was sitting quietly in the red house thinking about her husband silas and eppie were sitting outside their cottage near the quarry they had been to church too which they did every week like the casses and most of the villagers silas had started taking eppie to church when she was very young because dolly winthrop had persuaded him that every child should have some religious training because of eppie silas was completely accepted in raveloe now nobody thought he was strange any more in fact he was almost a popular fig ure in the village he was older now and could not work as hard as he used to recently as he had more time to think he had begun to re member the past and his old friends at the light street chapel he realized how his once lonely life had changed since eppie had come to him now he had friends and trusted people and was happy and he began to see that the god in the raveloe church was the same god he had been so angry with the last time he had been to the chapel it seemed to him that there had been some mistake in his past which had thrown a dark shadow over his early life perhaps now he would never know whether mr paston the chapel minister still thought he was guilty of stealing and he would never dis cover why the drawing of the lots had seemed to prove his guilt but there must be a good of goodness in this world he thought because he sent eppie to me i must just trust and believe that he is right he had told eppie how her mother had died in the snow and he had given her the dead woman s wedding ring eppie was not at all interested in who her real father was as she thought she had the best father in the world already at the moment she was sitting close to silas outside their door in the sunshine neither of them had spoken for a while father she said gently if i get married do you think i should wear my mother s ring oh eppie said silas surprised are you thinking of get ting married then well aaron was talking to me about it replied eppie blushing you know he s nearly twenty four now and is earning good money and he d like to marry soon and who would he like to marry asked silas with rather a sad smile why me of course daddy said eppie laughing and kiss ing her father he won t want to marry anyone else and you d like to marry him would you asked silas yes one day i don t know when aaron says everyone s married some time but i told him that s not true because you haven t ever been married have you daddy no child said silas i was a lonely man before you were sent to me but you ll never be lonely again father said eppie loving ly that s what aaron said he doesn t want to take me away from you he wants us all to live together and he ll do all the work and you needn t work at all father he ll be like a son to you well my child you re young to be married said silas but he s a good young man we ll ask his mother what we should do she always gives us good advice you see eppie i m getting older and i d like to think of you with a strong young husband to take care of you for the rest of your life yes we ll ask dolly winthrop for her opinion godfrey confesses at last at the red house nancy was waiting patiently for god frey to come home to tea suddenly one of the servants ran into the sitting room crying excitedly madam there are lots of people in the street they re all running the same way towards the quarry perhaps there s been an accident jane don t get so excited replied nancy calmly i ex pect it s nothing serious go and get the tea ready mr godfrey will be back soon but secretly she was saying to herself i hope nothing s happened to godfrey so when he came into the room a few minutes later she was very relieved my dear i m so thankful you ve come she said going towards him i was beginning to think she stopped suddenly when she saw godfrey s shaking hands and white face she put her hand on his arm but he did not seem to notice and threw himself into a chair sit down nancy he said with difficulty i came back as soon as i could to prevent anyone telling you except me it s terrible news for me but i m more worried about how you will feel about it it isn t father or priscilla said nancy trying to control her trembling lips no it s nobody living said godfrey it s dunstan my brother who left home sixteen years ago and never came back we ve found him found his body all that s left of it in the old quarry nancy felt calmer now that was not terrible news you know the men have been draining our fields near the quarry well as a result the quarry has suddenly gone dry and we ve found him lying at the bottom we know it s him be cause he s wearing his watch and his rings godfrey paused it was not easy to say what came next do you think he drowned himself asked nancy wonder ing why her husband was so shaken by the death of a brother he had never loved no he fell in replied godfrey in a low voice dunstan was the man who robbed silas marner the bags of gold were found with his body oh godfrey i am sorry said nancy she understood how ashamed her husband must be the casses were so proud of their family name i had to tell you i couldn t keep it from you godfrey continued and then stopped looking at the ground for two long minutes nancy knew that he had something more to say finally godfrey lifted his eyes to her face and said every body s secrets are discovered sooner or later nancy i ve lived with a secret ever since i married you but i m going to confess it now i don t want you to discover it from someone else or hear about it when i m dead i was weak and hesitating when i was younger i m going to be firm with myself now nancy could not speak she stared at her husband in horror what secret could he possibly have from her nancy said godfrey slowly when i married you i hid something from you i was wrong not to tell you that woman silas marner found dead in the snow eppie s moth er that poor woman was my wife eppie is my child he paused looking worriedly at nancy but she sat quite still although her face looked rather white perhaps you won t be able to love me any more he said his voice trembling a little she was silent i was wrong i know i was wrong to marry molly and then to keep it a secret but i loved you nancy i only ever wanted to marry you still nancy was silent looking down at her hands and god frey almost expected her to get up and say she would leave him and go to live with her father and sister she was so religious and so firm in her ideas of right and wrong but at last she lifted her eyes to his and spoke she did not sound angry but only sad oh godfrey why didn t you tell me this long ago i didn t know eppie was yours and so i re fused to adopt her of course i d accept your child into our home but oh godfrey how sad to think we ve spent all these years with no children why didn t you confess the truth before we married we could be so happy now with a beautiful daughter who would love me as her mother tears were running down nancy s face but nancy cried godfrey bitterly angry with himself i couldn t tell you everything i was in danger of losing you if i told you the truth i don t know about that godfrey i certainly never want ed to marry anyone else but it wasn t worth doing wrong just so that you could marry me and our marriage hasn t been as happy for you as you thought it would be there was a sad smile on nancy s face as she said the last words can you ever forgive me for what i ve done nancy you have only hurt me a little godfrey and you ve been a good husband to me for fifteen years but it s the other wom an who you ve hurt the most and i don t see how you can put that right but we can take eppie into our home now said godfrey it ll be different now that she s grown up said nancy shaking her head sadly it ll be more difficult for her to get used to us but it s our duty to take care of your child and i ll ask god to make her love me then we ll go to the weaver s cottage tonight said god frey and talk to marner and eppie about it eppie has to decide that evening silas was resting in his chair near the fire after the excitement of the day eppie was sitting close to him holding both his hands and on the table was silas s lost gold he had put the coins in piles as he used to you see that s all i ever did in the long evenings before you came to me he was telling eppie just count my gold i was only half alive in those days what a good thing the money was taken away from me i was killing myself with working all day and counting money half the night it wasn t a healthy life and when you came with your yellow curls i thought you were the gold and then when i began to love you i didn t want my gold any more he stopped talking for a moment and looked at the money the gold doesn t mean anything to me now but perhaps if i ever lost you eppie if you ever went away from me i d need my gold again i d feel lonely then and i d think god had forgotten me and perhaps i d go back to my bad old habits there were tears in eppie s beautiful eyes but she did not have time to answer silas as just then there was a knock on the door when she opened it mr and mrs godfrey cass came in good evening my dear said nancy taking eppie s hand gently we re sorry to come so late well marner said godfrey as he and nancy sat down i m glad you ve got your money back and i m very sorry it was one of my family who stole it from you whatever i can do for you i will to repay what i owe you and i owe you a lot marner silas was always uncomfortable with important people like the young squire you don t owe me anything sir you ve already been very kind to me and that money on the table is more than most working people can save in their whole life eppie and i don t need very much godfrey was impatient to explain why they had come yes you ve done well these last sixteen years marner taking care of eppie here she looks pretty and healthy but not very strong don t you think she should be a lady not a working woman now mrs cass and i you know have no children and we d like to adopt a daughter to live with us in our beauti ful home and enjoy all the good things we re used to in fact we d like to have eppie i m sure you d be glad to see her be come a lady and of course we d make sure you have every thing you need and eppie will come to see you very often i expect godfrey did not find it easy to say what he felt and as a re sult his words were not chosen sensitively silas was hurt and afraid his whole body trembled as he said quietly to eppie af ter a moment i won t stand in your way my child thank mr and mrs cass it s very kind of them eppie stepped forward she was blushing but held her head high thank you sir and madam but i can t leave my father and i don t want to be a lady thank you she went back to silas s chair and put an arm round his neck brushing the tears from her eyes godfrey was extremely annoyed he wanted to do what he thought was his duty and adopting eppie would make him feel much less guilty about his past but eppie you must agree he cried you are my daughter marner eppie s my own child her mother was my wife eppie s face went white silas who had been relieved by hearing eppie s answer to godfrey now felt angry then sir he answered bitterly why didn t you confess this sixteen years ago before i began to love her why do you come to take her away now when it s like taking the heart out of my body god gave her to me because you turned your back on her and he considers her mine i know i was wrong and i m sorry said godfrey but be sensible marner she ll be very near you and will often come to see you she ll feel just the same towards you just the same said silas more bitterly than ever how can she feel the same we re used to spending all our time to gether we need each other godfrey thought the weaver was being very selfish i think marner he said firmly that you should consider what s best for eppie you shouldn t stand in her way when she could have a better life i m sorry but i think it s my duty to take care of my own daughter silas was silent for a moment he was worried that perhaps godfrey was right and that it was selfish of him to keep eppie at last he made himself bring out the difficult words all right i ll say no more speak to the child i won t pre vent her from going godfrey and nancy were relieved to hear this and thought that eppie would now agree eppie my dear said godfrey althought i haven t been a good father to you so far i want to do my best for you now and my wife will be the best of mothers to you i ve always wanted a daughter my dear added nancy in her gentle voice but eppie did not come forward this time she stood by silas s side holding his hand in hers and spoke almost coldly thank you sir and madam for your kind offer but i wouldn t be happy if i left father he d have nobody if i weren t here nobody shall ever come between him and me but you must make sure eppie said silas worriedly that you won t be sorry if you decide to stay with poor people you could have a much better life at the red house i ll never be sorry father said eppie firmly i don t want to be rich if i can t live with the people i know and love nancy thought she could help to persuade eppie what you say is natural my dear child she said kindly but there s a duty you owe to your lawful father if he opens his home to you you shouldn t turn your back on him but i can t think of any home except this one cried eppie tears running down her face l ve only ever known one father and i ve promised to marry a working man who ll live with us and help me take care of father godfrey looked at nancy let s go he said to her bitterly in a low voice we won t talk of this any more said nancy getting up we just want the best for you eppie my dear and you too marner good night nancy and godfrey left the cottage and walked home in the moonlight when they reached home godfrey dropped into a chair nancy stood near him waiting for him to speak after a few moments he looked up at her and took her hand that s ended he said sadly she kissed him and then said yes i m afraid we can t hope to adopt her if she doesn t want to come to us no said godfrey it s too late now i made mistakes in the past and i can t put them right i wanted to be childless once nancy and now i ll always be childless he thought for a moment and then spoke in a softer voice but i got yon nancy and yet i ve been wanting something different all the time perhaps from now on i ll be able to ac cept our life better and we ll be happier the following spring there was a wedding in raveloe the sun shone warmly as eppie walked through the village towards the church with silas aaron and dolly eppie was wearing the beautiful white wedding dress she had always dreamed of which nancy cass had bought for her she was walking arm in arm with her father silas i promise nothing will change when i m married father she whispered to him as they entered the church you know i ll never leave you there was quite a crowd of villagers outside the church to see the wedding just then miss priscilla lammeter and her fa ther drove into the village look father cried priscilla how lucky we re in time to see the weaver s daughter getting married doesn t she look lovely i m sorry nancy couldn t find a pretty little or phan girl like that to take care of yes my dear agreed mr lammeter now that we re all getting older it would be good to have a young one in the fam ily unfortunately it s too late now they went into the red house where nancy was waiting for them they had come to spend the day with her because godfrey was away on business and she would perhaps be lonely without him the casses were not going to eppie s wedding when the little wedding group came out of the church the villagers and silas s family all went to the rainbow there a wonderful wedding lunch was waiting for them which had been ordered and paid for by godfrey cass it s very generous of the young squire to pay for all this said the landlord as he refilled the beer glasses well what would you expect replied old mr macey sharply remember it was his own brother who stole the weaver s gold and mr godfrey has always helped master marner with furniture and clothes and so on since young ep pie came to the cottage well it s only right to help a man like master marner and i d like you all to remember i was the first to tell you i thought master marner was harmless and i was right now let s drink to the health of the happy young couple and the villagers lifted their glasses and cried to eppie and aaron when the meal was over and the guests had begun to return to their homes silas eppie and her new husband walked slow ly back to their cottage by the quarry it had been enlarged by godfrey cass s workmen and was looking lovely in the late af ternoon sunshine oh father said eppie what a pretty home ours is i think nobody could be happier than we are txtba www txtba com my first home the first place i can remember well was a pleasant field with a pond of clear water in it trees made shadows over the pond and water plants grew at the deep end on one side was another field and on the other side we looked over a gate at our master s house which stood by the roadside at the top of our field were more tall trees and at the bottom was a fast running stream while i was young i lived on my mother s milk but as soon as i was old enough to eat grass my mother went out to work during the day and came back in the evening there were six other young horses in me field although they were older than i was we all galloped together round the field and had great fun but sometimes the others would kick and bite they are young farm horses and haven t learned how to behave my mother told me you are different your father is well known and your grandfather twice won the most important race at newmarket your grandmother was quiet and gentle and you have never seen me kick or bite have you i hope you will grow up to be gentle and a willing worker and never bite or kick i have never forgotten my mother s advice she was a clever and sensible old horse her name was duchess but our master often called her pet he was a good kind man and my mother loved him very much whenever she saw him at the gate she trotted across he used to pat her and say well old pet and how is your little darkie i was a dull black colour so he called me darkie he sometimes brought a piece of bread for me or a carrot for my mother and i think we were his favourites when i was two years old something happened which i have never forgotten it was early spring and there was a light mist over the trees and fields i and the other young horses were feeding at the lower end of the field when we heard the distant cry of dogs the oldest among us lifted his head to listen there are the hounds he said and immediately raced off the rest of us followed him to the top of the field where we could see several fields beyond my mother and another old horse were standing near they ve found a hare said my mother and if they come this way we shall see the hunt soon the dogs were all racing down the field next to ours making a loud yo yo yo yo sound at the top of their voices after them came men on horses some in green coats and all galloping as fast as they could suddenly the dogs be came silent and ran around with their noses to the ground they ve lost the smell of the hare said the old horse perhaps it will escape but the dogs began their yo yo yo yo again and came at full speed towards our field just then a hare wild with fear ran towards the trees the dogs jumped over the stream and ran across the field followed by the huntsmen six or eight jumped their horses over the stream close behind the dogs be fore the hare could get away the dogs were upon her with wild cries we heard a terrible scream and that was the end of the hare one of the men picked her up and held her by the leg she was covered in blood but all the huntsmen seemed pleased i was so greatly surprised that at first i did not see what was happening by the stream but when i did look i saw a sad sight two fine horses were down one in the stream and the other on the grass one rider who seemed unhurt was climb ing out of the water but the other lay quite still his neck is broken said my mother i can t understand why men are so fond of this sport they quite often hurt them selves and ruin good horses all for one hare that they could get more easily some other way but we are only horses and don t know why men do these things they carried the dead rider to our master s house and i heard afterwards that it was george gordon the only son of a local landowner and a fine young man a man from the village came to look at the black horse on the grass the animal was in great pain and one of his legs was broken the man began to feel the horse all over then he shook his head someone ran to our master s house and came back with a gun soon after there was a loud bang and a terrible cry then all was still the black horse did not move again my mother was very unhappy i ve known that horse for years she said his name was rob roy he was a good brave horse she never went near that end of the field again not many days after we heard the church bell and saw a long strange black carriage pulled by black horses they were taking the body of young george gordon to the churchyard to bury him he would never ride again i never knew what they did with rob roy but it was all for one little hare birtwick park i was beginning to grow handsome my coat was fine and soft and was a shiny black i had one white foot and a pretty white star on my forehead when i was four years old mr gordon came to look at me he looked closely at my eyes my mouth and my legs and then i had to walk and trot and gallop for him when he has been trained mr gordon said to my master he will do very well my master liked to train his horses himself before selling them and the next day my training began to train a horse is to teach him to wear a saddle and to carry a man woman or child on his back the horse must also learn to wear a collar and to stand still when it is put on then to have a carriage fixed behind him and to go fast or slow whichever his driver wishes he must never bite or kick or talk to other horses and must always do what his master tells him however tired or hungry he feels like all horses that have grown up i had to wear a bit and bridle a bit is a great piece of cold hard metal as thick as a man s finger which is pushed into a horse s mouth between his teeth and over his tongue with the ends coming out at the corners it is held there by straps which go over the horse s head under his neck round his nose and under his chin reins which the rider holds are fastened to each end of the bit slowly with my master s kind words and gentle ways i learned to wear my bit and bridle next there was the saddle my master put it on my back very gently then fixed the straps under my body speaking qui etly to me all the time then one morning he got on my back and rode me round the field on the soft grass he did this every day until i was used to it then he took me to the village where a man fixed metal shoes on to each hoof my feet felt heavy and strange but i got used to this too there were more new things to wear first a heavy collar on my neck and a bridle with great side pieces against my eyes called blinkers with these on i could only see in front of me but in time i got used to everything and could do my work as well as my mother for a fortnight my master sent me to a neighbour s farm for another kind of training which was very useful to me one field was next to the railway and had sheep and cows in it and i was put in among them i shall never forget the first train that thundered by and how i galloped to the far side of the field trembling with fear at this terrible noise but after a few days i cared as little as the sheep and cows when a train passed by it was early in may when a man came to take me away to mr gordon s house my master said goodbye darkie be a good horse and always do your best i put my nose into his hand and he patted me kindly and then i left my first home mr gordon s house which was called the hall stood in birtwick park near the village we went into the park through a large gate then trotted along a smooth road between some trees to the house and gardens beyond this were the stables there was room for many horses and carriages my stable had four good stalls and a large window it was very pleasant the first stall was called a loose box where a horse is not tied up all the time but is free to move around as he likes it is a great thing to have a loose box the groom put me into it and gave me some oats then he patted me spoke kindly and went away in the stall next to mine stood a little fat grey pony hello i said what is your name merrylegs he said turning round i m very handsome i carry the young ladies on my back and sometimes i take mrs gordon out in one of the carriages are you going to live next to me in the box yes i said then i hope you are well behaved he said i don t like anyone who bites a horse s head looked over from the stall beyond it was a tall brown mare and she did not look pleased so it s you who has turned me out of my bx she said i m sorry i said but the man put me in here so it is not my fault i don t want to argue with anyone i just wish to live in peace later merrylegs told me about the tall brown mare ginger has a bad habit of biting people he explained one day she bit james in the arm and miss flora and miss jessie the children were afraid to come into the stable after that if you don t bite i hope they ll start to come again i told him i never bit anything except grass and could not understand why ginger bit people no one was ever kind to her before she came here said merrylegs john and james do all they can to please her and our master is never unkind i m twelve years old and i know that there isn t a better place for a horse all round the country than this john has been here fourteen years and is the best groom there ever was and you never saw a kinder stableboy than james there was no reason for ginger to bite anyone it s her own fault that she did not stay in the box the name of the groom was john manly the next morning he got out his brushes and gave me a good grooming then put a saddle on me he rode me slowly at first then at a trot then at a gallop as we came back through the park we met mr and mrs gordon they stopped and john jumped off well john how does he go said mr gordon he s a fine horse sir said john he s fast but the light est touch of the rein will guide him they were shooting birds near highwood and a gun went off closeby he pulled up a lit tle but i just held the rein and he wasn t frightened at all it s my opinion he was never frightened or beaten when he was young good said mr gordon i ll ride him tomorrow i remembered my mother s advice and the next day i tried to do exactly what my master wanted me to do he was a very good rider and when he came home his wife was waiting for him at the door how do you like him my dear she asked i have never ridden a more pleasant horse answered mr gordon what shall we call him what about blackbird like your uncle s old horse said his wife he s far handsomer than blackbird said mr gordon yes she said he s quite a beauty and he has a kind in telligent face shall we call him black beauty black beauty why yes i think that s a very good name said mr gordon john went into the stable and told james i d call him rob roy said james if it did not remind ev eryone of the past i never saw two horses more alike that s not surprising said john didn t you know that farmer grey s old duchess was the mother of them both so poor rob roy who was killed at the hunt was my brother now i understood why my mother was so unhappy when he died john was very proud of me and seemed to know just how a horse feels and james was kind too a day or two later i went out in the carriage with ginger i wondered how we would get on together but i found it easy to trot along beside her merrylegs was a happy little pony and was everyone s favourite we were soon great friends and i became quite happy in my new home ginger s story what more could i want freedom for the first four years of my life i had a large field where i could gallop around at full speed with no straps no bit and no blinkers now i stood in a stable night and day except when i was wanted for work and sometimes when john took me out i felt so strong so full of life that i wanted to jump or dance calm down boy he would say then as soon as we were out of the village he would let me trot fast for a few miles some grooms punished a horse for getting too excited but not john he knew how to control me with only the sound of his voice and i was very fond of him sometimes we did have our freedom in the field for an hour or two this was on fine sundays in the summer because the carriage never went out on sundays it was wonderful the grass was cool and soft to our feet and the air was so sweet and we could gallop or lie down or roll over on our backs or do what we liked one day ginger asked me about my old home and my train ing when i finished telling her she said life has been differ ent for me i was taken from my mother when i was young and there was no kind master like yours to look after me i had a bad time when i was trained several men caught me in a corner of the field and one held my nose so hard that i could only just breathe then another pulled my mouth open to put the bit in and i was pulled along and beaten from behind they didn t give me a chance to understand what they wan ted the old master mr ryder knew about horses but he gave up most of the business to his son who was tall and strong but not gentle they called him samson and he said that no horse could throw him out of the saddle one day he made me run round the field on a long rein until i was very tired and miser able the next morning he did the same again then he put a saddle and bridle on me and a new kind of bit into my mouth the new bit was very painful and i pulled away and stood up on my back legs which made him very angry he stayed in the saddle and beat me with a whip but after a long and terri ble battle i threw him off and galloped to the other end of the field i watched him go into the stable but no one came to fetch me time went on and the sun was very hot i was hungry and very thirsty at last just as the sun was going down the old master came out with some oats he spoke kindly and held out the oats for me to eat then patted me gently and looked at the blood on my sides where samson had whipped me poor girl he said then led me to the stable samson was there keep out of the way said the master you ve done a bad day s work for this horse with your bad temper a bad tempered man will never make a good tempered horse he led me into my box and took off my saddle and bridle then he called for some warm water and gently cleaned the blood from my sides after that he often came to see me but a man called joe went on training me he was quiet and thoughtful and i soon learned what he wanted after my training ginger went on i was bought by a dealer to match another horse of my colour but then we were sold to a man in london who drove us with a bearing rein a rein to hold our heads up unnaturally high and to keep them there for hours and hours until the pain was terrible we had to wear two bits instead of one and mine was so sharp that it made my mouth bleed sometimes we waited for hours while our master or mistress was at parties or the theatre and if we weren t patient the driver would whip us didn t your master care about you at all i said only about how we looked replied ginger he knew very little about horses the driver told him i had a bad temper but would soon get used to the bearing rein i was willing to work and learn but they were so cruel that it made me angry then i broke away from the carriage one day and that was the end of that place i was sold to another man but he had a groom as bad tem pered as samson he hit me across the legs with his stable brush if i didn t move quickly i hated him and one day when he made me angry i bit him he never came into my stall af ter that and i was soon sold again a dealer heard of me and said he thought he knew one place where i should do well it s wrong for a fine horse to go bad like that he said and i was brought here not long before you came of course it s very different here but who knows how long it will last i ve decided that all men are my natural enemies i was sorry for ginger but as the weeks went on she be came happier and more gentle i do believe ginger is getting quite fond of me james said one day she ll be as good as black eeauty one day replied john kindness is all she needs poor thing kindness and cruelty aneighbour of the gordons mr blomefield had a large family of boys and girls who often came to play with miss jessie and miss flora one of the girls was the same age as miss jessie two of the boys were older and there were sev eral little ones whenever they came the children loved to ride merrylegs one afternoon when they were visiting james brought merrylegs in and said now behave yourself what did you do merrylegs i asked him those young people didn t seem to know whell i was tired he said so i just threw them off backwards it was the only thing they could understand you threw the children off i sald oh no did you throw miss flora or miss jessie no of course not i m quiet and careful with them and with the little ones i m the best friend and riding teacher those children have it s not them it s the boys he said the other children rode me for nearly two hours then the boys rode me one after the other for an hour hitting me with a stick i didn t get annoyed but i did get tired so i stopped once or twice to let them know but boys think a horse is like a machine and can go on as long and as fast as they want it to they never think that we get tired as one was whipping me i stood up on my back legs and he fell off he got on again and i did the same then the other boy tried and i put him down on the grass they re not bad boys and don t mean to be cruel but they have to learn when they told james he was angry to see those big sticks and told the boys not to use them again i would give those boys a good kick said ginger i know you would said merrylegs but they expect me to look after those children and they expect me to be good tempered and i will be you never had a place where they were kind to you ginger and i m sorry for you but good places make good horses and i wouldn t make our people angry for anything if i started kicking people they would very quickly sell me perhaps to someone cruel i hope that never happens i often wondered why sir oliver the oldest horse in the stable had so short a tall only about twenty centimetres long and one day i asked him did you have an accident it was no accident he said angrily my long and beautiful tail was cut off when i was a young horse at that time some owners thought it was fashionable how terrible i said yes terrible and cruel said sir oliver now i can never brush the flies off my sides or back legs and all because of fashion some owners cut off the tails of their dogs to make them look brave or cut their pretty little ears to make them look fashionable they don t cut off the ends of their children s ears do they why do they think it s all right to do these things to their animals mr gordon was never cruel and he would not stand by and watch others be cruel to animals we were riding home one morning when we saw a big man driving towards us in a small carriage pulled by a beautiful little pony as he got to the park gates the pony turned towards them without warning the man pulled the pony s head round so roughly that the little animal almost fell over then he began to whip the pony angrily the animal tried to move forward but the man held it back and continued to whip it sawyer shouted my master the man looked up he was a builder who often came to the park to do work he s too fond of going his own way he told my master he s not supposed to turn in through your gates the road is straight on you often drive that pony to my house said my master it only shows that the horse is intelligent and remembers these things how could he know you weren t going there to day i ve never seen a horse beaten so cruelly or with so much anger what will people think of you sawyer as well as hurting the horse you hurt your own good name do you want people to think of you as a cruel bad tempered man we went home slowly and i could tell by his voice that the master was unhappy at what we had seen the storm one day in the autumn my master had to go to a distant town on business john harnessed me to the carriage and the three of us went off there had been a lot of rain and the wind was very strong when we came to the river the wa ter was so high it nearly reached the wooden bridge and many of the fields were under water in one low part of the road the water was half way up to my knees we got to the town and the master s business took a long time it was late in the afternoon when we started back for home the wind was much stronger and as we drove through a wood i heard my master say i ve never been out in a storm as bad as this john indeed i thought so too hearing the ter rible noise of that wild wind in the trees i wish we were out of this wood said my master yes sir agreed john we don t want one of those bran ches coming down on top of us but just as he finished speaking there was a great noise of wood breaking and a big tree came crashing down through the other smaller trees and fell across the road right in front of us i was very frightened and i stopped immediately but i didn t turn round or try to run away john jumped out and quickly ran to my side what can we do now john said my master we can t drive over the tree or get round it sir said john we ll have to go back to the crossroads and take the longer road round to the wooden bridge it will make us late but the horse isn t tired it was nearly dark when we got to the wooden bridge we could see water over the middle of it but this often happened when the river was high but the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge i was sure something was wrong and i stopped suddenly go on beauty said my master and he touched me with the whip i did not move so he hit me sharply but i would not go forward there s something wrong said john and he jumped from the carriage and began to look round he tried to lead me for ward come on beauty what s the matter of course i could not tell him but i knew the bridge was not safe just then a man ran out of the house on the other side of the bridge stop stop he cried what s the matter shouted my master the bridge is broken in the middle said the man and part of it was carried away if you come across you ll fall in the river thank you beauty john said to me and turned me gently round to the right hand road by the riverside it got darker and the wind got quieter as i trotted towards home by another much longer road the two men were quiet for some time but then my master spoke we were very close to drowning in that river john he said men may be clever enough to think of things for them selves but animals know things without thinking and that s often saved a man s life as it has ours tonight people don t realize how wonderful their animals are nor do they make friends with them as they should when we arrived back at birtwick park the mistress ran out to meet us i ve been so worried she said are you all right did you have an accident we nearly did said my master but black beauty was cleverer than we were and saved us all from drowning one morning early in december the master came to the stable with a letter in his hand looking very serious good morning john he said tell me does james work hard and do what you tell him to do yes sir always replied john and he doesn t stop work when your back is turned never sir and if he goes out with the horses does he stop to talk to friends or go into houses where he has no business leaving the horses outside said the master no sir said john and if anybody has said that about james i don t believe it i never had a pleasanter more honest young man in this stable the master smiled and looked across at james who was standing by the door james i m glad john s opinion of you agrees with my own he said i ve had a letter from my wife s brother sir clifford williams he wants me to find him an honest young groom who knows what he s doing the man who drives his carriage is getting old and needs a young man who will work with him and be able to do his job one day how old are you nineteen next may sir said james that s young what do you think john it is young sir said john but he s tall and strong he doesn t have much experience of driving but he has a light touch and a quick eye well james said the master talk to your mother at din ner time and let me know what you want to do a few days later it was agreed that james would go to clif ford hall in a month or six weeks and for the next few weeks he drove the carriage we went in and out of town through busy streets and to the railway station where the road was narrow and there were lots of other carriages hurrying to and from the station then my master and mistress decided to visit some friends who lived about seventy five kilometres from our home you can drive us james said my master the fire the first day we travelled about fifty kilometres but james drove carefully and made sure that ginger and i were always on the smoothest part of the road it was evening when we reached the hotel where we were going to stay that night it was in the market place and two stablemen came out to us the chief stableman was a pleasant old man and he led me into a long stable with six or eight stalls in it and two or three horses the younger man brought in ginger and james watched while we were groomed i thought i was quick james told the old stableman but you re quicker than anyone i ve worked with horses since i was twelve years old and i can tell you it s good to be able to work with a well behaved well cared for animal like this said the stableman patting my neck who is your master mr gordon of birtwick park said james i ve heard of him said the stableman he s a good judge of horses and the best rider in this part of the country he doesn t ride very often now said james not since the poor young master was killed i read about that in the newspaper said the stableman a fine horse was killed too wasn t it yes an excellent horse said james he was the brother of this one and just like him terrible said the old man it was a bad place to jump wasn t it a man s life and a horse s life are worth more than a hare or they should be later that evening the younger stableman brought in anoth er horse and a young man with a pipe in his mouth came into the stable to talk to him towler go up and get some hay and put it down for this horse will you said the stableman but put down your pipe first all right said the other man and went up a ladder and through a little door i heard him step across the floor over my head and push down some hay through a hole in the roof into the new horse s feeding place james came in to look at us before he went to bed and then the door was locked i don t know how long i slept or what time it was when i woke up but the air seemed thick and i heard ginger and an other horse moving about worriedly it was quite dark and i could see nothing the stable was full of smoke and it was al most impossible to breathe the smoke seemed to come from the little door above me and i could hear a strange noise up there the other horses were now all awake moving about restlessly at last i heard someone outside and then the younger sta bleman ran in with a light he began to untie the horses and tried to lead then out the first horse would not go with him nor the second or third he tried to pull me out but he was so frightened himself that he frightened me and i would not move the noise above was louder now and there was a shout of fire outside the old stableman came in quietly and quickly and got one horse out then another by now the flames were coming down through the roof and the noise was terrible then i heard james s voice quiet and friendly as it always was come on beauty he said we ll soon get you out of this smoke he took off his scarf and tied it over my eyes then led me out patting me all the time he took the scarf off then shouted take this horse somebody while i go back for the other windows in the hotel were open and people were shouting i watched the stable door where the smoke came out thicker than ever then i heard one voice above all the others and recognized it as my master s james howard james howard are you there there was no answer only the crash of something falling in the stables but the next moment i saw james coming through the smoke leading ginger with him my brave boy said the master are you hurt james shook his head unable to speak because of the smoke suddenly i heard the sound of wheels and galloping horses it s the fire engine shouted someone two horses ran past me pulling the heavy fire engine the firemen jumped out and we went quickly into the wide quiet market place out of their way the master led us to a large hotel on the other side where a stableman came to take us in then the master hurried off to find his wife the next morning he came to see how we were and to speak to james i did not hear much but james looked very happy and the master looked proud of him how did the fire start someone said they saw dick towler go into the stable smoking a pipe but that when dick came out he didn t have it the young stableman said that he asked dick to go up the ladder to put down some hay but also told him to put down his pipe first dick said that he did this but nobody believed him james said the roof and floor had all fallen in and only the black walls were standing the two poor horses who could not get out were buried under the fallen roof joe green the rest of our journey was very easy and the next evening we reached the house of our master s friend where a groom took us to a comfortable stable we stayed two or three days then returned home john was glad to see us and we were glad to see him i wonder who will come in my place said james little joe green said john he s only fourteen and a half but he has a kind heart and wants to come so i ve agreed to try him for six weeks the next day joe green came to learn all he could before james left he was a nice happy boy and always came to work singing but then the day came when james had to leave us i m leaving a lot behind he said sadly to john my mother and you a good master and mistress and the horses and i shan t know anybody at the new place it s hard to leave your home for the first time said john but if you get on well which i m sure you will your moth er will be proud of you everyone was sorry to lose james but joe tried hard to learn and john was pleased with him one night i woke up to hear the stable bell ringing loudly i heard the door open at john s house and his feet running up to the hall he was back quickly wake up beauty he said coming into the stable we must go quickly now and before i could think he had the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head the master was waiting at the hall door with a letter in his hand ride for your life john he said give this to dr white then rest your horse and be back as soon as you can mrs gordon is very ill away went john and i through the park through the vil lage and down the hill there was a long piece of flat road by the riverside and john said now beauty do your best i needed no whip and for two miles i galloped as fast as i could perhaps even faster than my grandfather who won the race at newrmarket when we came to the bridge john slowed me down a little and patted my neck well done beauty he said then i was off again as fast as before the air was cold and the moon was bright and it was a pleasant night we went through a village then a dark wood then uphill then down hill and after twelve kilometres we came to the town it was three o clock when we stopped by dr white s door john rang the bell then knocked on the door like thunder a window was pushed up and dr white s head appeared what do you want he said mrs gordon is very ill said john you must come at once or she ll die here s a letter the doctor was soon at the door my horse has been out all day and is exhausted can i take yours my master told me to rest him said john but take him if you think it s best sir i ll soon be ready said the doctor john stood by me and patted my neck i was very hot then the doctor came out with his riding whip you won t need that sir said john black beauty will go until he drops the doctor was a heavier man than john and not so good a rider but i did my very best joe was waiting at the gate and the master was at the hall door he did not say a word the doctor went into the house with him and joe led me to the stable my legs were shaking and there was not a dry hair on my body the water ran down my legs and i was hot all over poor joe he was young and knew very little he did the best he could cleaning my legs and my chest but he did not put a warm cloth on me he thought i was so hot that i would not like it he gave me some cold water to drink then he gave me some food and went away soon i began to shake and tremble with cold and i ached all over i wished john was there but he had twelve kilometres to walk so i tried to sleep after a long time i heard john at the door i gave a low cry and he was at my side in a moment i could not tell him how i felt but he seemed to know immediately he covered me with three warm cloths then ran for some hot water and made me a warm drink john seemed very angry stupid boy he said to himself over and over again no cloth put on and i suppose the water was cold too boys are no good i became very ill and could not breathe without pain john looked after me day and night and my master often came to see me too my poor beauty he said one day my good horse you saved your mistress s life yes you saved her life i was very glad to hear that john told my master that he never saw a horse go so fast one night tom green joe s father came to help john give me my medicine then stayed for a while at first both men were silent then tom said john please say a kind word to joe the boy is heart broken he can t eat his meals and he can t smile he knows it s his fault beauty is ill but he did his best he says if beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again but he s not a bad boy after a short pause john said i know he meant no harm but i m proud of that horse and i hate to think his life may be thrown away like this but i ll give the boy a kind word to morrow if beauty is better i heard no more of this conversation as the medicine did well and sent me to sleep and in the morning i fell much bet ter joe learned quickly after this and was so careful that john began to give him many things to do one day john was out and the master wanted a letter taken immediately to a gentle man s house about five kilometres away he told joe to saddle me and take it the letter was delivered and we were returning through a field where we saw a cart full of bricks they were so heavy that the wheels of the cart were half buried in the soft ground and the horses could not move the cart at all the man leading the horses was shouting and whipping them without stopping don t whip the horses like that joe shouted at him the wheels are half buried and won t move i ll help you take some bricks out to make the cart lighter mind your own business said the man angrily he was in a terrible temper and more than half drunk joe turned me and we galloped towards the house of the brickmaker mr clay joe knocked on the door the door opened hallo young man began mr clay there s a man in your field whipping two horses to death joe told him his voice shaking with anger i told him to stop but he wouldn t i offered to help him lighten the cart but he refused i think he s drunk please go sir i will said the man and hurried off when we got home joe told john all about it you did the right thing said john many people would ride by and say it was none of their business but cruelty is everybody s business just before dinner the master sent for joe the drunken man was accused of cruelty to horses and joe was wanted to tell his story to the police i ll tell it gladly said joe we heard afterwards that the poor horses were so exhausted and so badly beaten that the man might have to go to prison joe came across and gave me a friendly pat we won t al low cruelty will we old friend he said and he seemed to have grown up suddenly earlshall park i lived at birtwick park for three happy years but then changes came our mistress was often ill and the doctor advised her to go and live in a warm country for two or three years everyone was very sorry but the master immediately started making arrangements to leave england john did his work silently and sadly and joe didn t sing any more then we heard that the master had sold ginger and me to an old friend of his lord gray merrylegs was given to the neighbour mr blomefield and joe was employed to look after him john was offered several good jobs but he wanted to wait and look around i want to train young horses he told the master i cannot think of anyone more suitable for that work than you john said the master if i can help you in any way write to me the next morning john took ginger and me to earlshall park where lord gray lived there was a very fine house and lots of stables john asked for mr york who was going to be our new driver mr york was a good looking man of about forty with a voice that expected to be obeyed he called a groom to take us to our boxes then invited john to have a drink with him we were taken to a pleasant stable and put in boxes next to one another then we were groomed and fed half an hour later john and mr york came to see us mr york looked at us carefully is there anything you want to mention about them mr manly he said i don t believe there s a better pair of horses in the coun try said john but they re not alike the black one has the most perfect temper i ve ever known the other was badly treated before she came to us but has grown better tempered in the last three years we ve never used a bearing rein with either of them they ll wear one here said york lady gray follows the fashion and if her horses are not reined up tight she doesn t like it i m sorry to hear that said john he came to pat each of us for the last time i held my face close to him which was all i could do to say goodbye and then he was gone and i have never seen him since lord gray came to look at us the next day and seemed pleased he heard what john had said about us keep an eye on the mare he said to york don t make the bearing rein too tight at first and i ll mention it to my wife in the afternoon we were harnessed to the carriage and la dy gray came out and looked at us she was a tall proud look ing woman and did not look pleased but she said nothing and got into the carriage the bearing rein annoyed me but did not pull my head any higher than i was used to carrying it i was worried about gin ger but she seemed quite happy but the next afternoon when lady gray came down the steps she said york you must put those horses heads higher they don t look nice i m sorry my lady said york but they have not been reined up for three years but if it pleases you i can take them up a little more do that she said that day we had to pull the carriage up a steep hill i want ed to put my head forward to make the work easier but i couldn t now you can see what it s like said ginger when we came back if it doesn t get any worse i shall say nothing but i won t have the rein pulled up tight each day the bearing reins were shortened a little more then one day lady gray came out later than usual and said york when will you get those horses heads up pull them up at once and let s have no arguing york came to me first and made the rein very tight then he went to ginger but the moment he took off the rein in order to shorten it she stood up on her back legs york and the groom could not control her she kicked herself out of the car riage and fell down kicking me on the leg as she went york sat on her head to keep her still and shouted let the black horse out undo the carriage cut the harness the groom cut me out of the harness and hurried me back to my box then ran back to york i was angry and my leg hurt and i felt that i wanted to kick the first person who came near me soon after ginger was led in by two grooms york was with her and came to look at me i knew those bearing reins would cause trouble he said to himself he saw where i had been kicked and washed the place gently with hot water to help the pain lord gray was angry when he heard what had happened he blamed york for taking orders from the mistress and york said that he would take orders only from lord gray himself from now on but things went on the same as before except that ginger was never put into the carriage again i pulled it with a horse called max who was used to the tight rein but those four months pulling lady gray s carriage were terrible the sharp bit cut into my tongue and mouth the rein hurt my neck and made it difficult to breathe and i felt tired and very miserable in the spring lord gray and some of his family went up to london and took york with them two daughters remained at the hall lady harriet never went out in the carriage and lady anne preferred riding on horseback with her brother or cousins she chose me for her horse and i enjoyed these rides sometimes with ginger sometimes with lizzie a horse liked by the young gentlemen there was a gentleman called blantyre staying at the hall who always rode lizzie and was so pleased with her that lady anne wanted to try her i don t advise it said blantyre she s too easily fright ened for a lady to ride my dear cousin said lady anne laughing i ve been rid ing horses since i was a baby and have followed the hounds many times now help me up so blantyre helped her into the saddle then climbed on me just as we were moving off lady harriet asked for a message to be taken to dr ashley in the village the village was about two kilometres away and the doctor s house was the last one in it blantyre got off to open the gate for lady anne but she said i ll wait here for you he went off and we waited there was a field with an open gate on the opposite side of the road and at that moment some young horses came trotting out they were wild and excited and there was a boy behind them waving a large whip suddenly one of the young horses ran across the road and banged into lizzie s back legs she gave a violent kick nearly unseating lady anne and immedi ately galloped away at full speed i gave a loud neigh for help and made a noise with my feet until mr blantyre came running out of the doctor s house he saw lizzie and lady anne now far away down the road and quickly jumped into the saddle and we raced after them for about two kilometres the road was straight then it turned to the right before becoming two roads long before we came to the bend lady anne was out of sight which way had she gone a woman was in her garden looking up the road which way shouted blantyre to the right cried the woman away we went up the right hand road we saw her for a moment then she was gone again round another bend several times we saw her but lost her again then we came to some rough land very uneven and full of holes in the ground the worst possible place for galloping on this open ground we could now see lady anne clearly her long hair flying out behind her in the wind and slowly we began to catch up there was a wide ditch ahead and i was sure it would stop them but without a pause lizzie jumped it and fell i cleared the ditch and landed safely lady anne was lying on the ground not moving blantyre jumped down beside her and called her name but there was no reply her face was white and her eyes were closed annie dear annie do speak he cried there were two men cutting grass close by and they saw lizzie galloping away without a rider and came across can you ride blantyre asked one of them i m not a good horseman sir he said but i ll do my best ride this horse to the doctor s and ask him to come imme diately then go on to the hall said blantyre tell them all you know and ask them to send a carriage the man climbed into my saddle and we galloped off i tried not to shake him about too much and he soon discovered that he needed no whip there was a lot of excitement at the hall when they heard what happened i was put into my box the saddle and bridle were taken off and a cloth was thrown over me two days later blantyre came and patted me you did well he said i m sure you knew annie was in danger she must ride only you from now on from this i knew that my young mistress was out of danger and would soon be able to ride again the accident and new masters aman called reuben smith looked after us while york was in london he was gentle and clever with horses and an excellent driver but he had one fault he sometimes drank too much for weeks or months he was all right but then without warning he would begin to drink heavily and be have badly but he was a useful man so york had kept quiet about smith s drinking saying nothing to lord gray then one night smith drove some ladies and gentlemen home from a party and was so drunk that he could not hold the reins york could not hide this and lord gray told smith to leave however some time later york spoke again to lord gray who was very kind hearted and he took reuben smith back smith promised never to get drunk again and kept his promise and because of this he was told to look after the stables while york was away one day the carriage needed some repairs so it was arranged that smith would take it to town leave it at the carriage maker s and then ride me back again mr blantyre wanted to go to the station so he went with us at the station mr blantyre gave smith some money and said take care of lady anne reuben and don t let anyone else except her ride black beauty we left the carriage at the maker s and smith rode me to the white lion hotel he told the stableman to give me some food and have me ready for four o clock one of my front shoes was loose but the stableman did not see it until four o clock smith came back at five and said he would now leave at six be cause he d met some old friends the stableman told him about the loose shoe it ll be all right until we get home said smith he finally came back at nine o clock shouting loudly and in a very bad temper we left and almost immediately he began to gallop often giving me sharp cuts with the whip although i was going at full speed before we were out of the town my shoe came off but smith was too drunk to notice it was very dark and on the rough road at that speed my foot was soon cut and bleeding from the sharp stones i could not go on the pain was too great and i fell violently on both my knees smith was thrown off he tried to get up but couldn t then he lay still i could do nothing but wait it was nearly midnight when i heard a horse s feet and the wheels of a carriage i neighed loudly and was very happy to hear an answering neigh from ginger and men s voices then the carriage came out of the darkness and stopped two men jumped down beside smith it s reuben said one and he s not moving robert he s dead said robert touching smith his hands are cold and his head is covered with blood they looked at me and saw my cut knees the horse has been down and thrown him said robert he tried to lead me forward but i almost fell again he s bad in the foot too no wonder he went down riding over these stones without a shoe reuben was drunk ned he would nev er ride a horse without a shoe unless he was drunk ned took smith s body back in the carriage and robert tied his handkerchief round my foot and led me slowly home no one blamed me for the accident the owner of the white lion hotel said that reuben smith was drunk when he left but i had to leave earlshall and so did ginger for a month or two i was allowed to live out in a field and one day ginger was brought in to join me she had been ruined by the hard riding of lord gray s son and aher twelve months rest she was going to be sold and although my knees got better they looked very ugly and so i was no longer suit able for a fashionable family it was very pleasant being in the field with ginger but one day robert came in and took me away we were both very sad to say goodbye to each other ginger and i i was sold to a man in bath who kept many horses and dif ferent kinds of carriages for hire i was a job horse and all kinds of people hired me some were good drivers others were very bad then one man persuaded my master to sell me to a friend of his who wanted a safe pleasant horse for riding and so that summer i was sold to mr barry mr barry knew very little about horses but he hired a com fortable stable for me and a man called filcher to look after me he ordered the best oats and plenty of other good food for me to eat too for a while all went well but then there seemed to be fewer oats and more grass in my meals the grass food though very good was not enough to keep me strong and healthy however i could not say anything and it went on for about two months then one afternoon my master rode into the country to see a friend a gentleman farmer who knew about horses and who looked very closely at me your horse doesn t look as well as he did when you first had him barry he said feeling my neck and shoulders see how wet and warm he is after just a gentle ride my groom says that horses are never in good condition in the autumn said my master but this is only august said the farmer with your light work and the good food he shouldn t be like this i don t know who eats your oats my friend he went on but i doubt that your horse gets any of them i advise you to watch your groom more closely oh how i wanted to speak i wanted to tell my master where his oats went to my groom came every morning at six o clock bringing his little by with him the boy carried a basket and went into the room where the oats were kept i would see them filling a bag with oats and putting the bag into the basket five or six mornings after the visit to the farmer the boy left the stable with his basket of oats but came back soon after looking frightened with two policemen holding his arms show me where your father keeps the food for his chickens one policemen said to the boy the boy began to cry but there was no escape moments later the policemen found another empty bag like the one in the boy s basket and they took filcher away with them that was the last i ever saw of him another groom was employed but he was very lazy about cleaning and i became thin and unhealthy from standing in a wet dirty stable after all this trouble with grooms mr barry decided to stop keeping a horse and i was sent to a horse fair a place where hundreds of horses were bought and sold and more lies were told i think than in any other place in the country that day i was lucky i was bought for twenty five pounds by a man called jeremiah barker but everyone called him jerry and i shall do the same q a london cab horse jerry barker was a small man but well made and quick in all his movements he lived in london and was a cab driver jerry s wife polly was a little woman with smooth dark hair and dark eyes his son harry was nearly twelve years old and was a tall good tempered boy his daughter dolly was eight and she looked just like her mother jerry had his own cab and two horses which he drove and groomed himself his other horse was a tall white animal called captain the next morning polly and dolly came to see me harry had helped his father since early that morning and had already decided that i would be a good horse polly brought me a piece of apple and dolly brought me some bread we ll call him jack after the old one said jerry shall we polly yes she said i like to keep a good name going captain went out in the cab all morning and i went out in the afternoon jerry took a lot of care to make sure that my col lar and bridle were comfortable and there was no bearing rein we went to the cab stand where the other cabs were waiting for passengers and took our place at the back of the last cab several of the other drivers came to look at me too handsome saia one you ll find something wrong with him one morning then a man in a grey coat and grey hat came up his name was grant and he looked a happy sensible kind of man he had been longer on the cab stand than any of the other men so they let him through to have a look at me and waited for his opinion he looked me all over very carefully then said he s the right kind for you jerry i don t care what you paid for him he ll be worth it my first week as a cab horse was very hard i was not used to london the noise the hurry the crowds of horses carts and carriages but jerry was a good driver and soon discovered that i was willing to work and do my best he never used the whip on me and we soon understood each other as well as a horse and man can do jerry kept his horses clean and gave us plenty of food and fresh water and on sundays we rested i never knew a better man than my new master he was kind and good tempered like john manly harry was clever at stable work and always wanted to do what he could polly and dolly came in the morning to brush out the cab and to wash the glass while jerry gave captain and me a grooming there was a lot of laughing and fun between them which all helped to keep captain and me happy the family came early in the morning because jerry did not like lateness it always made him angry when people wanted him to drive hard because of their own lateness one day two wild looking young men called to him cabby hurry up we re late for our train at victoria get us there in time for the one o clock train and we ll pay you double i will take you at the usual speed gentlemen said jerry extra money doesn t pay for extra speed larry s cab was standing next to ours he opened the door and said i m your man gentlemen my horse will get you there all right and as he shut them in with a smile at jerry he said he always refuses to go faster than a trot then whipping his horse hard he went off as fast as he could jerry patted me on the neck extra money won t pay for that kind of thing will it jack he said although he was against hard driving to please careless peo ple he always went at a fair speed and was not against going faster if there was a good reason i remember one morning we were on the stand waiting for a passenger when a young man carrying a large suitcase went by he stepped on a piece of apple which lay in the road and fell down heavily jerry ran across the road and helped him up then took him into a shop to sit him down some time later the young man looking white and ill came out again and called jerry so we went across the road can you take me to the south eastern railway he said my fall has made me late and it s very important that i don t miss the twelve o clock train i ll pay you extra if you can get me there in time we ll do our best sir said jerry and helped him into the cab it was always difficult to drive fast in the city in the middle were used to it and no one was faster at getting through the carriages and carts all moving at different speeds going this way and that way in and out in and out we went as fast as a horse can do it and we got to the station just as the big clock showed eight minutes to twelve we re in time said the young man happily thank you my friend and your good horse too take this extra money no sir said jerry thank you but it isn t necessary i m glad we were in time now hurry and catch your train when we got back to the cab stand the other men were laughing because jerry had driven hard to the train how much extra did he pay you jerry said one driver nothing said jerry he offered me extra but i didn t take it if jack and i choose to have a quick run now and then that s our business and not yours you ll never be a rich man then said larry perhaps not said jerry but i ll be a happy one and you larry added mr grant will die poor because you spend too much money on new whips beating your poor horse until it s exhausted and then you have to buy another one well i ve never had good luck with my horses said larry and you never will said mr grant good luck is very careful who she travels with and mostly chooses those who are kind and sensible that s my experience anyway he turned round again to his newspaper and the other men went back to their cabs winter came early with snow rain or strong winds almost ev ery day for weeks jerry sometimes went to a coffee shop near the cab stand and sometimes dolly came with some hot soup that polly had made for him one cold windy day dolly was waiting for jerry to finish his soup when a gentleman came towards us jerry started to give the soup bowl back to dolly and was just going to take off my warm cloth when the man said no no finish your soup my friend i can wait in the cab until you ve finished jerry thanked him then came back to dolly that s a real gentleman dolly he said he has time and thought for the comfort of a poor cab driver jerry finished his soup then we took the man to clapham after that he took our cab several times and often came to pat me it was very unusual for anyone to notice a cab horse and i was grateful another day the gentleman saw a cart with two horses standing in the street the driver was not with them and i don t know how long they had been standing there however they decided to move on a few steps suddenly the cart driver ran out of a building and caught them he seemed very angry and began to whip the horses hard even beating them around the head our gentleman saw him and walked quickly across stop that at once or i ll call the police he said the driver was drunk and he began to shout but he stopped whipping the horses meanwhile our gentleman wrote down the name and address that was on the side of the cart why do you want that shouted the driver our gentleman didn t answer he came back to the cab many people have thanked me fof telling them how their horses have been used he told jerry i wish there were more gentlemen like you sir said jerry they re needed in this city goodbye to old friends one day we were waiting outside one of the london parks when a dirty old cab drove up beside ours the horse was brown with bones that showed through her coat i was eating some hay and the wind took a little of it her way the poor animal put out her long thin neck and picked it up then turned and looked for more there was a hopeless look in her dull eye and i wondered where i d seen her before then she looked straight at me black beauty is that you she said it was ginger but how different she looked her face which was once so full of life was now miserable and full of pain and her breathing was very bad i moved closer to her so that we could have a quiet talk and it was a sad story that she told me after twelve months rest at earlshall she was considered to be ready to work again and was sold to a gentleman she got on well for a little while but after a long gallop one day she became ill again she was rested was seen by a horse doctor then sold in this way she went from owner to owner several times each one poorer than the one before so at last i was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses and hires them out said ginger you look happy and comfortable with life as a cab horse and i m glad but it s different for me they whip me and work me seven days a week they say that they paid more for me than i was worth and now they re trying to get their money back by working me until i drop you used to stand up and fight when people were cruel to you i said yes i did once said ginger but men are stronger than we are and if they re cruel and have no feelings then there s nothing we can do about it oh i wish the end would come i wish i was dead i was very sad i put my nose against hers but could find nothing to say that would cheer her up i think she was pleased to see me because she said you re the only friend i ever had a few weeks after this a cart with a dead horse in it passed by our cab stand it was a brown horse with a long thin neck and i believe it was ginger i hoped it was because then her troubles would be over there was one day when we were very busy first a fat gentle man with a large bag wanted to go to bishopsgate station then we were called by a lady who wanted to be taken to regent s park then a man jumped into the cab and called out bow street police station quick after another journey or two we came back to the cab stand and jerry gave me some food saying we must eat when we can on days like this jack and he took out the meat and bread polly had given him but neither of us had eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman came along the street she was carrying a child and she looked lost and worried can you tell me the way to st thomas s hospital please she asked i have to take my little boy there and i m a stranger in london the little boy was crying as she spoke he s in great pain and can t walk but the doctor says that if i can get him to the hospital then perhaps he ll get well again you can t carry him through the crowds said jerry it s five kilometres and that child is heavy i m strong said the woman i think i can manage if i know the way you can t do it just get into this cab and i ll drive you there don t you see that it s beginning to rain no sir i can t do that she said i ve only just enough money to get me home again listen said jerry i ve got a wife and children at home and i d be ashamed of myself if i let a woman and a sick child put themselves in danger get in the cab and i ll take you for nothing oh how kind you are said the woman and began to cry jerry opened the door but two men ran up calling out cab it s taken said jerry but one man pushed past the wom an and jumped in followed by the other this cab is already taken gentlemen jerry said again by this lady lady said one of the men unpleasantly looking at the woman s poor clothes she can wait our business is very im portant and anyway we were in first and we ll stay in a smile came over jerry s face as he shut the cab door stay in as long as you like gentlemen i can wait while you rest yourselves he walked over to the young woman who was standing nearby they ll soon be gone don t worry he said laughing and he was right when the two men realized that they were going to have a very long wait they got out calling jerry all kinds of bad names after this we were soon on our way to the hospital thank you a thousand times said the young woman as jerry helped her out of the cab i hope your child will soon be better said jerry he watched her go in then patted my neck it was something he always did when he was pleased the rain was now coming down fast and just as we were leaving the hospital a lady came down the steps calling cab jerry seemed to know her at once jerry barker is it you said the woman i m very glad to find you here it s difficult to get a cab in this part of london today i ll be proud to take you said jerry where do you want to go paddington station said the woman we got to the station and went in under cover the lady stood beside the cab talking to jerry for some time and i dis covered that she was once polly s mistress how do you like cab work in the winter she asked jerry polly was worried about your cough last year she worries because i work all hours and in all kinds of weather said jerry but i get on all right and i would be lost without horses to look after it would be wrong to harm your health in this work when you have a wife and two children said the lady there are many places where good drivers or grooms are wanted if you ever decide to give up cab work let me know she put some thing into his hand there s some money for the children jerry thanked her and after leaving the station we went christmas and the new year are no holidays for cab drivers and their horses people go to parties and dances and th work is often late sometimes driver and horse have to wait for hours shaking with cold we had a lot of late work during christmas week and jerry s cough was bad on new year s eve we took two gentlemen to a house in the west end and were told to come for them at eleven o clock you may have to wait a few minutes but don t be late one of them said jerry arrived at the right time and we waited the wind was very cold and it was snowing jerry pulled one of my cloths higher over my neck then walked up and down trying to keep warm at half past twelve jerry rang the door bell and asked if the gentlemen still wanted the cab the man at the door said oh yes you ll be wanted at one o clock the door opened and two men came out they got in the cab without a word and told jerry where to drive it was three kilometres away and when the men got out they didn t say they were sorry for the long wait but they were angry when jerry made them pay for the extra waiting time but it was money hard earned when we got home jerry could not speak and his cough was terrible but he groomed me and made sure that i was warm and comfortable it was late the next morning before anyone came and then it was only harry he cleaned us and gave us our food but was very quiet later that morning he came again and this time dolly came with him she was crying and i discovered from their conversation that jerry was dangerously ill two days passed and only harry and dolly came to the sta ble on the third day mr grant from the cab stand arrived when harry was in the stable i won t go to the house boy but how is your father he said he s very bad said harry i m sorry to hear that said mr grant he s the best man i know but when he came the next day harry was able to tell him father is better today mother hopes he will get over it soon thank god said mr grant he was a kind man and did a lot to help the family during this time because while jerry was ill he was earning no money and we all had to eat jerry got slowly better but the doctor said he must never do cab work again the children talked a lot about what their mother and father would do but a few days later dolly ran into the stable to find harry there s a letter from mrs fowler mother s old mistress said dolly she wants father to be her carriage driver and we re going to live in a cottage in the country with chick ens and apple trees and everything this was bad news for me i was not young now and could not hope for a better master than jerry although mr grant promised to find a comfortable place for me i never saw jerry again and was very sorry to leave hard times i was sold to a baker who jerry knew but the baker s bearing rein up this made it difficult for me to pull a heavy cart and i found the work very hard one day after three or four months of this i was pulling the cart which was much heavier than usual up a steep hill i had to stop several times to rest which didn t please jakes move on you lazy horse or i ll make you he shouted and he hit me with his whip after a few more metres i had to stop again the whip came down across my back once more and the pain was sharp i was doing my best but the driver was still punishing me cruelly which seemed very unfair jakes was whipping me a third time when a woman hurried over and said oh please don t whip your horse like that i think i can help if you ll let me jakes laughed oh he can t use all his strength when his head is held back with that bearing rein the woman went on if you take it off i m sure he ll do better anything to please a lady said jakes smiling the rein was taken off and i moved my head up and down several times to help my aching neck poor boy is that what you wanted said the woman pat ting me she turned to jakes if you speak to him kindly and lead him on i believe he ll do better jakes took the rein and i put down my head and moved on i pulled the cart up the hill then stopped to take a breath well that helped said jakes but if i went without a bearing rein all the time the other cart drivers would laugh at me it s fashionable you see it s better to start a good fashion than to follow a bad one said the woman many gentlemen don t use bearing reins now she gave me another pat on the neck and walked on after that jakes always took off my bearing rein when i was going up a hill and that made my life easier but pulling heavy carts day after day slowly began to exhaust me and a younger horse was brought in to do my work i was sold to another cab owner whose name was nicholas skinner he was hard on his drivers and they were hard on the horses we worked long hours had no sunday rest and it was a hot summer my driver was just as hard as his master and he had a cruel whip with something sharp at the end which often cut me and made me bleed it was a terrible life and sometimes like poor ginger i wished i was dead one day i nearly got my wish we were at the railway station when a family of four people hired us there was a noisy man with a lady a little boy a young girl and a lot of heavy luggage father said the young girl this poor horse can t take us and all our luggage he s too tired oh he s all right miss said my driver he put a heavy box on the cab with the other luggage father please take a second cab said the girl i m sure this is very cruel grace get in at once and don t be stupid said her father the driver knows his own business my gentle friend had to obey and box after box was lifted up and put on the top of the cab or next to the driver then the driver hit me with his whip and we moved out of the sta tion the cab was very heavy and i had not eaten or rested since early that morning i did my best and got along quite well un til we came to ludgate hill by then i was exhausted and the heavy cab was too much for me my feet went from under me and i fell heavily knocking all the breath out of me i lay quite still because i could not move indeed i expected to die there were angry voices above me and luggage was taken off the cab but it was all like a dream i tnought i heard the girl s voice saying oh that poor horse it s all our fault someone loosened my bridle and collar and another voice said he s dead he ll never get up again i heard a police man giving orders but i did not open my eyes cold water was thrown over my head some medicine was put into my mouth and i was covered with a cloth i don t know how long i was there but a man with a kind voice persuaded me to try to get up and i managed it then i was gently led to some stables close by that evening i was taken back to skinner s stables and the next morning the horse doctor came to see me he s been worked too hard said the doctor there s no strength left in him then he must go for dog food said skinner i have no fields for sick horses it doesn t suit my business i work them for as long as they ll go then i sell them for what i can get there s a horse fair in ten days time said the doctor if you rest him and give him food he may get better and then you may get more than his skin s worth luckily for me skinner took the doctor s advice and after rest and food i began to feel better ten days later i was taken to the horse fair a few miles outside london my last home i was sold to a farmer at the horse fair but it was his young grandson who persuaded him to buy me the two of them walked past me and seeing kindness in the farmer s face i lifted my head put my ears forward and tried to look my best the farmer stopped and looked at me there s a horse willie that has known better days he said poor thing said the boy do you think he was ever a car riage horse grandfather oh yes said the farmer look at his fine head and the shape of his neck and shoulder he reached out a hand and patted me on the neck i put out my nose in answer to his kindness and the boy gently put his hand against my face look how well he understands kindness said the boy won t you buy him and make him young and strong again the man who was selling me said the boy can recognize a good horse sir this one isn t old just tired and thin from too much work in six months he ll be fine five pounds changed hands and soon after i was taken to my new home the farmer gave orders for me to have hay and oats every night and morning and i was let out into a large field in the daytime willie the young boy was responsible for me and he came to see me every day bringing carrots or apples during that winter the rest the good food the soft grass and gentle running and trotting all helped to make me feel quite young again when the spring came the farmer tried me with a carriage and i did the work quite easily he s growing young willie he said we ll give him some gentle work and look for a good home for him one day during this summer the groom cleaned and dressed me with special care and willie seemed half worried and half excited as he got into the carriage with his grandfather i hope the ladies like him said the farmer a kilometre or two beyond the village we came to a pretty house and willie went to knock on the door he asked if miss blomefield and miss ellen were at home they were and willie stayed with me while the farmer went into the house he came back about ten minutes later with three ladies they seemed to like me but one of them worried by my knees won dered if i was safe it s true his knees were broken once said the farmer but we don t know why he fell it was probably a careless driver and not the horse s fault at all he seems very safe to me if you like him you can try him for a few weeks he went on then your driver will see what he thinks of him one of the three ladies a tall white faced lady who held the arm of a younger woman said you have always given us good advice about our horses so we accept your offer to try him the next morning a young man came for me he looked pleased until he saw my knees then he said i m surprised you suggested this horse to my ladies you re only taking him to try him said the farmer if he s not as safe as any horse you ever drove send him back young man i was taken to a comfortable stable given some food then left to myself the next day the groom was cleaning my face when he said that s just like the star that black beauty had on his forehead i wonder where he is now he looked more closely at me white star on the forehead one white foot and a lit tle white place on his back it must be black beauty beauty do you know me i m little joe green who almost killed yon and he began patting me all over my back i could not say i remembered him as he was now a fine young man with a black moustache and a deep voice but i was sure he knew me and that he was joe green and i was very glad i put my nose up to him and tried to say that we were friends i never saw a man so pleased that afternoon i was harnessed to a carriage for miss ellen to try me joe green went with her and told her that he was sure i was mr gordon s old black beauty i shall write to mrs gordon and tell her that her favourite horse has come to us said miss ellen how pleased she will be i have now lived in this happy place a whole year joe is the best and kindest of grooms my work is easy and pleasant and i feel my strength coming back again the ladies have promised that they will never sell me and so i have nothing to fear and here my story ends my troubles are all over and i am at home and often before i am quite awake i dream i am still in the field at birtwick standing with my old friends under the apple trees txtba www txtba com pip meets a stranger my first name was philip but when i was a small child i could only manage to say pip so pip was what every body called me i lived in a small village in essex with my sister who was over twenty years older than me and married to joe gargery the village blacksmith my parents had died when i was a baby so i could not remember them at all but quite often i used to visit the churchyard abut a mile from the village to look at their names on their gravestones my first memory is of sitting on a gravestone in that church yard one cold grey december afternoon looking out at the dark flat wild marshes divided by the black line of the river thames and listening to the rushing sound of the sea in the distance don t say a word cried a terrible voice as a man jumped up from among the graves and caught hold of me if you shout i ll cut your throat he was a big man dressed all in grey with an iron chain on his leg his clothes were wet and torn he looked exhausted and hungry and very fierce i had never been so frightened in my whole life oh don t cut my throat sir i begged in terror tell me your name boy quick he said still holding me and show me where you live my name s pip sir and i live in the village over there he picked me up and turned me upside down nothing fell out of my pocket except a piece of old bread he ate it in two bites like a dog and put me back on the gravestone so where are your father and mother he asked there sir i answered pointing to their graves what he cried and was about to run when he saw where i was pointing oh he said i see they re dead well who do you live with if i let you live which i haven t decided yet with my sister sir wife of joe gargery the blacksmith blacksmith you say and he looked down at his leg then he held me by both arms and stared fiercely down into my eyes now look here you bring me a file you know what that is and you bring me some food if you don t or if you tell anyone about me i ll cut your heart out i promise i ll do it sir i answered i was badly fright ened and my whole body was trembling you see he continued smiling unpleasantly i travel with a young man a friend of mine who roasts boys hearts and eats them he ll find you wherever you are and he ll have your heart so bring the file and the food to that wooden shelter over there early tomorrow morning if you want to keep your heart that is remember you promised i watched him turn and walk with difficulty across the marshes the chain hanging clumsily around his leg then i ran home as fast as i could my sister mrs joe gargery was very proud of the fact that she had brought me up by hand nobody explained to me what this meant and because she had a hard and heavy hand which she used freely on her husband as well as me i supposed that joe and i were both brought up by hand she was not a beautiful woman being tall and thin with black hair and eyes and a very red face she clearly felt that joe and i caused her a lot of trouble and she frequently complained about it joe on the other hand was a gentle kind man with fair hair and weak blue eyes who quietly accepted her scolding because joe and i were in the same position of being scolded by mrs joe we were good friends and joe protected me from her anger whenever he could so when i ran breathless into the kitchen he gave me a friendly warning she s out look ing for you pip and she s got the stick with her this stick had been used so often for beating me that it was now quite smooth just then mrs joe rushed in where have you been you young monkey she shouted i jumped behind joe to avoid being hit with the stick only to the churchyard i whispered starting to cry churchyard if i hadn t brought you up you d be in the churchyard with our parents you ll send me to the church yard one day now let me get your supper ready both of you for the rest of the evening i thought of nothing but the stranger on the marshes sometimes as the wind blew round the house i imagined i heard his voice outside and i thought with horror of the young man who ate boys hearts just before i went to bed we heard the sound of a big gun on the marshes was that a gun joe i asked ah said joe another convict s escaped one got away last night they always fire the gun when one escapes who fires the gun i asked joe shook his head to warn me too many questions frowned my sister if you must know it s the men in the prison ships who fire the gun i wonder who is put into prison ships and why i asked in a general way quietly desperate to know the answer this was too much for mrs joe listen my boy i didn t bring you up by hand to annoy people to death there are ships on the river which are used as prisons people who steal and murder are put in the prison ships and they stay there for years sometimes and they always begin their life of crime by asking too many questions now go to bed i could not sleep at all that night i was in terror of the young man who wanted my heart i was in terror of the man with the iron chain i was in terror of my sister who would soon discover i had stolen her food as soon as there was a lit tle light in the sky outside my window i got up and went qui etly down to the kitchen i stole some bread cheese and a big meat pie hoping that as there was a lot of food ready for christmas nobody would notice what was missing i did not dare take the whole brandy bottle so i poured some into a smaller bottle to take away with me then i filled up the brandy bottle with what i thought was water from a big brown bottle i took a file from joe s box of tools and ran out on to the dark marshes the mist was so thick that i could not see anything al though i knew my way to the shelter very well i almost got lost this time i was near it when i saw a man sitting on the ground half asleep i went up and touched his shoulder he jumped up and it was the wrong man he was dressed in grey too and had an iron chain on his leg he ran away into the mist it s the young man i thought feeling a pain in my heart when i arrived at the shelter i found the right man he looked so cold and hungry that i felt sorry for him trembling violently he swallowed the brandy and ate the food like a hunt ed animal looking around him all the time for danger you re sure you didn t tell anyone or bring anyone no sir i m glad you re enjoying the food sir thank you my boy you ve been good to a poor man but i m afraid there won t be any left for him him who s that my friend stopped in the middle of eating the young man who travels with you oh him he replied smiling he doesn t want any food i thought he looked rather hungry i answered he stared at me in great surprise looked when just now over there i found him half asleep and i thought it was you he was dressed like you and i was anxious to express this politely he had the same reason for wanting to borrow a file then i did hear them fire the gun last night you know boy when you re on the marsh alone at night you imagine all kinds of things voices calling guns firing soldiers marching but show me where this man went i ll find him and i ll fin ish with him i ll smash his face give me the file first i was afraid of him now that he was angry again i m sorry i must go home now i said he did not seem to hear so i left him bending over his leg and filing away at his iron chain like a madman halfway home i stopped in the mist to listen and i could still hear the sound of the file catching a convict all that morning i was frightened that my sister would discover that i had stolen from her but luckily she was so busy cleaning the house and roasting the chickens for our christmas lunch that she did not notice that i had been out or that any food was missing at half past one our two guests arrived mr wopsle had a large nose and a shining bald forehead and was the church clerk mr pumblechook who had a shop in the nearest town was a fat middle aged man witn a mouth like a fish and staring eyes he was really joe s uncle but it was mrs joe who called him uncle every christmas day he arrived with two bottles of wine handing them proudly to my sister oh uncle pumblechook this is kind she always replied it s no more than you deserve was the answer every time sitting at table with these guests i would have felt uncomfortable even if i hadn t robbed my sister not only was pumblechook s elbow in my eye but i wasn t allowed to speak and they gave me the worst pieces of meat even the chickens must have been ashamed of those parts of their bodies when they were alive and worse than that the adults never left me in peace before we eat let us thank god for the food in front of us said mr wopsle in the deep voice he used in church do you hear that whispered my sister to me be grateful especially said mr pumblechook firmly be grateful boy to those who brought you up by hand why are the young never grateful wondered mr wopsle sadly their characters are naturally bad answered mr pumblechook and all three looked unpleasantly at me when there were guests joe s position was even lower than usual if that was possible but he always tried to help me if he could sometimes he comforted me by giving me extra gravy he did that now just imagine boy said mr pumblechook if your sister hadn t brought you up you listen to this said my sister to me crossly if as i say she hadn t spent her life looking after you where would you be now joe offered me more gravy he was a lot of trouble to you madam mr wopsle said sympathetically to my sister trouble she cried trouble and then she started on a list of all my illnesses accidents and crimes while everybody except joe looked at me with disgust joe added more gravy to the meat swimming on my plate and i wanted to pull mr wopsle s nose in the end mrs joe stopped for breath and said to mr pumblechook have a little brandy uncle there is a bottle al ready open it had happened at last now she would discover i had stolen some brandy and put water in the bottle mr pumblechook held his glass up to the light smiled importantly at it and drank it when immediately afterwards he jumped up and began to rush round the room in a strange wild dance we all stared at him in great surprise was he mad i wondered if i had murdered him but if so how at last he threw himself gasping into a chair crying medicine then i understood instead of filling up the brandy bottle with water i had put mrs joe s strongest and most unpleasant medicine in by mistake that was what the big brown bottle contained but how could my medicine get into a brandy bottle asked my sister fortunately she had no time to find the answer as mr pumblechook was calling for a hot rum to remove the taste of the medicine and now she said when the fat man was calmer you must all try uncle pumblechook s pre sent to us a really delicious meat pie that s right mrs joe said mr pumblechook looking more cheerful now bring in the pie you shall have some pip said joe kindly i knew what would happen next i could not sit there any longer i jumped down from the table and ran out of the room but at the front door i ran straight into a group of soldiers mrs joe was saying as she came out of the kitchen the pie has gone but stopped when she saw the soldiers excuse me ladies and gentlemen said the officer in charge i m here in the king s name and i want the black smith and why do you want him said my sister crossly madam replied the officer politely speaking for myself i d like the pleasure of meeting his fine wife speaking for the king i d like him to repair these handcuffs ah very good very good said mr pumblechook clap ping the soldiers waited in the kitchen while joe lit the forge fire and started work i began to feel better now that everyone had forgotten the missing pie how far are we from the marshes asked the officer about a mile replied mrs joe that s good we ll catch them before it s dark convicts officer asked mr wopsle yes two escaped convicts out on the marshes has anyone here seen them the others all shook their heads nobody asked me when the handcuffs were ready joe suggested we should go with the soldiers and as mrs joe was curious to know what happened she agreed so joe mr wopsle and i walked behind the men through the village and out on to the marshes i hope we don t find those poor men joe i whispered i hope not either pip he whispered back it was cold with an east wind blowing from the sea and it was getting dark suddenly we all stopped we heard shouts in the distance this way run the officer ordered and we all rushed in that direction the shouts became clearer murder escaped convict help at last we discovered two men fighting each other one was my convict and the other was the man who had run away when i had seen him near the shelter somehow the soldiers held the men apart and put the hand cuffs on them here he is i m holding him for you shouted my convict officer he tried to murder me cried the other man his face was bleeding and he was clearly very frightened murder him no said the first that would be too easy i want him to suffer more back on the prison ship he s lying as he did at our trial you can t trust compeyson just then he noticed me for the first time i shook my head at him to show that i had not wanted the soldiers to find him he stared at me but i did not know if he understood or not the prisoners were taken to the riverside where a boat was waiting to take them on to the prison ship just as he was about to leave my convict said officer after my escape i stole some food from the blacksmith s house bread cheese brandy and a meat pie i m sorry i ate your pie blacksmith i m glad you did replied joe kindly we don t know why you re a convict but we wouldn t want you to die of hunger the man rubbed his eyes with the back of his dirty hand we watched the small boat carry him out to the middle of the river where the great black prison ship stood high out of the water held by its rusty chains he disappeared into the ship and i thought that was the last i had seen of him an opportunity for pip i always knew i would be apprenticed to joe as soon as i was old enough and so i used to spend most of the day helping him in the forge however i also attended the village evening school which was organized by an ancient relation of mr wopsle s her teaching mostly consisted of falling asleep while we children fought each other but mr wopsle s young cousin biddy tried to keep us under control and teach us to read write and count mr wopsle examined us every three months in fact he did not ask us any questions at all but read aloud from shakespeare waving his arms dramatically and enjoying the sound of his own voice one night about a year after the escaped convicts had been caught i was sitting by the kitchen fire writing a letter to joe i didn t need to because he was sitting right next to me but i wanted to practise my writing after an hour or two of hard work i passed this letter to him pip old boy cried joe opening his kind blue eyes very wide what a lot you ve learnt here s a j and an o that s for joe isn t it pip i wondered whether i would have to teach joe from the beginning so i asked how do you write gargery joe i don t write it at all said joe but you know i am fond of reading give me a good book or newspaper a good fire and i ask no more well when you come to a j and an o how interesting reading is didn t you ever go to school joe when you were young no pip you see my father drank a lot and when he drank he used to hit my mother and me too sometimes so she and i ran away from him several times and she used to say now joe you can go to school but my father had such a good heart that he didn t want to be without us so he always came to find us and took us home and hit us so you see pip i never learnt much poor joe but remember pip my father had a good heart i wondered about that but said nothing he let me become a blacksmith which was his job too only he never worked at it i earned the money for the family until he died and listen to this pip i wanted to put this on his gravestone whatever the fault he had from the start remember reader he had a good heart did you invent that yourself joe i asked surprised i did said joe proudly it came to me in a moment from my own head but pip sad to say there wasn t enough money for the gravestone my poor mother needed it in bad health she was she died soon after found peace at last joe s blue eyes were watery i was lonely then and i met your sister now pip joe looked firmly at me because he knew i was not going to agree with him your sister is a fine woman i could think of nothing better to say than i m glad you think so joe so am i said joe i m glad i think so very kind of her bringing you up by hand such a tiny baby you were so when i offered to marry your sister i said and bring the poor little child to live with us there s room for him at the forge i put my arms round joe s neck and cried into his shirt don t cry old boy he said always the best of friends you and me as i dried my tears he continued so here we are pip now if you teach me a bit and i warn you now that i m very stupid mrs joe must never know and why because she likes to be in charge you know giving the orders joe i asked why don t you ever rebel well said joe to start with your sister s clever and i m not and another thing and this is serious old boy when i think of my poor mother s hard life i m afraid of not behaving right to a woman so i d much rather seem a bit weak with mrs joe than shout at her or hurt her or hit her i m just sorry she scolds you as well pip and hits you with the stick i wish i could take all the scolding myself but there it is pip just then we heard the sound of a horse on the road mrs joe and uncle pumblechook were returning from market the carriage arrived and in a rush of cold air they were in the kitchen now said mrs joe excitedly throwing off her cloak if this boy isn t grateful tonight he never will be she s offering the boy a great opportunity agreed pumblechook trying to look grateful i looked at joe making the word she with my lips he clearly did not know either you were speaking of a she he said politely to them she is a she i suppose mrs joe replied crossly unless you call miss havisham a he and even you wouldn t do that the rich miss havisham who lives all alone in the big house in town asked joe there aren t any other miss havishams that i know of she wants a boy to go and play there she asked uncle pumblechook if he knew of anyone and uncle pumblechook thinking of us as he always does suggested this boy and what s more uncle pumblechook realizing that this boy s fortune may be made by going to miss havisham s has of fered to take him into town tonight in his carriage and let him sleep in his own house and deliver him tomorrow to miss havisham s and just look she cried catching hold of me look at the dirt on this by i was washed from top to toe in mrs joe s usual violent manner and handed over in my tightest sunday clothes to mr pumblechook in the carriage taking me into town i cried a little i had never been away from joe before and i had no idea what was going to happen to me at miss havisham s mr pumblechook seemed to agree with my sister that i should be punished as much as possible even when eating and so for breakfast next morning he gave me a large piece of bread with very little butter and a cup of warm water with very little milk and insisted on checking my learning what s seven and thirteen boy he continued testing me all through breakfast and nine and eleven so i was glad to arrive at miss havisham s house at about ten o clock it was a large house made of old stone and with iron bars on the windows we rang the bell and waited at the gate even then mr pumblechook said and fourteen but i pretended not to hear him then a young lady came to open the gate and let me in mr pumblechook was following me when she stopped him do you wish to see miss havisham she asked if miss havisham wishes to see me answered mr pumblechook a little confused ah said the girl but you see she doesn t mr pumblechook dared not protest but he whispered angrily to me before he turned away boy behave well here and re member those who brought you up by hand i thought he would come back and call through the gate and sixteen but he did not the young lady took me through the untidy garden to the house although she called me boy she was the same age as me but she seemed much older than me she was beautiful and as proud as a queen we went through many dark passages until we reached a door where she left me taking her candle with her i knocked at the door and was told to enter i found myself in a large room where the curtains were closed to allow no daylight in and the candles were lit in the centre of the room sitting at a table was the strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see she was wearing a wedding dress made of rich material she had a bride s flowers in her hair but her hair was white there were suitcases full of dresses and jewels around her ready for a journey she only had one white shoe on then i realized that over the years the white wedding dress had become yellow and the flowers in her hair had died and the bride inside the dress had grown old everything in the room was ancient and dying the only brightness in the room was in her dark old eyes that stared at me who are you said the lady at the table pip madam mr pumblechook s boy come to play come close let me look at you as i stood in front of her i noticed that her watch and a clock in the room had both stopped at twenty minutes to nine you aren t afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born asked miss havisham i am sorry to say i told a huge lie by saying no do you know what ths is she asked putting her hand on her left side yes madam it made me think of my convict s travel ling companion your heart madam i added my heart broken she cried almost proudly with a strange smile then she said i am tired i want to see some thing different play no order could be more difficult to obey in that house and that room i was desperate enough to consider rushing round the table pretending to be pumblechook s carriage but i could not make myself do it and just stood there helplessly i m very sorry madam i said my sister will be very angry with me if you complain but i can t play just now everything is so strange and new and sad i stopped afraid to say more miss havisham looked down at her dress and then at her face in the mirror on the table so strange to him so well known to me she whispered so new to him so old to me and so sad to us both call es tella when estella finally came with her candle along the dark passage miss havisham picked up a jewel from her table and put it in estella s hair very pretty my dear it will be yours one day now let me see you play cards with this boy with this boy but he s a common working boy i thought i heard miss havisham whisper well you can break his heart she sat like a dead body ready for the grave watching us play cards in the candle light i almost wondered if she was afraid that daylight would turn her into dust what coarse hands this boy has and what thick boots cried estella in disgust before we had finished our first game i was suddenly aware that what she said was true what do you think of her whispered miss havisham to me i think she s very proud i whispered back anything else i think she s very pretty anything else i think she s very rude and and i d like to go home and never see her again although she s so pretty i don t know i d i d like to go home now miss havisham smiled you can go home come again in six days time estella give him some food go pip and so i found myself back in the overgrown garden in the bright daylight estella put some bread and meat down on the ground for me like a dog i was so offended by her behaviour towards me that tears came to my eyes as soon as she saw this she gave a delighted laugh and pushed me out of the gate i walked the four miles home to the forge thinking about all i had seen as i looked sadly at my hands and boots i remembered that i was only a common working boy and wished i could be different my sister was curious to know all the details of my visit and kept asking me question after question somehow i felt i could not or did not want to explain about miss havisham and her strange house i knew my sister would not understand and the worst of it was that old fool pumblechook arrived at tea time to ask more questions just looking at his fishy staring eyes and open mouth made me want to keep silent leave this boy to me madam he told mrs joe i ll make him concentrate now boy what s forty three and seventy two i don t know i said i didn t care either is it eighty five for example he joked yes i answered although i knew it wasn t my sister hit me hard on the head boy he continued describe miss havisham very tall and dark i said lying is she uncle asked my sister eagerly oh yes answered mr pumblechook so i knew immediately that he had never seen her this is the way to get information from this boy he added quietly to mrs joe how well you make him obey you uncle said mrs joe now boy what was she doing when you arrived she was sitting in a black carriage i replied mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at each other in a black carriage they repeated yes i said becoming more confident and miss estella her niece i think handed in gold plates with cake and wine through the windows was anybody else there asked mr pumblechook four dogs huge ones they ate meat out of a silver basket where was this carriage boy in her room but there weren t any horses can this be possible uncle asked mrs joe she s a strange woman madam it s quite possible what did you play at boy we played with flags i answered what lies i was telling estella waved a blue one and i had a red one and miss havisham waved one with little gold stars on out of the carriage window fortunately they asked no more questions and were still discussing the wonderful things i had seen when joe came in from the forge when i saw his blue eyes open wide in surprise i felt very sorry i had lied and that evening as soon as i found joe alone for a moment i confessed to him that i had lied about my visit to miss havisham is none of it true pip he asked shocked no black carriage but at least there were dogs weren t there pip no not even one dog no joe i m sorry pip old boy his kind face looked very unhappy if you tell lies where do you think you ll go when you die i know joe it s terrible i don t know what happened oh i wish i didn t have such thick boots and such coarse hands i m so miserable joe that beautiful young lady at miss havisham s said i was common and i know i am somehow that made me tell lies one thing to remember pip said joe lighting his pipe slowly is that lies are always wrong you can t stop being common by telling lies that s not the way to do it and you re learning all the time pip look at that letter you wrote me last night even the king had to start learning at the beginning didn t he that reminds me any flags at miss havisham s no that s a pity look here pip this is a true friend speaking to you take my advice no more lies live well and die happy encouraged by joe s honest words i went to bed but i couldn t stop myself thinking that estella would consider joe s boots too thick and his hands too coarse and our whole family common that was a day i shall never forget a present from a stranger i desperately wanted to be accepted by estella i realized i could never become well educated just by attending old mrs wopsle s evening school so i asked mr wopsle s cousin biddy to teach me everything she knew she helped me as much as she could but i knew it would take a long time to reach estella s level one evening i went to fetch joe from the village pub where my sister sometimes allowed him to smoke his pipe and have a beer mr wopsle and joe were sitting with a stranger a man i d never seen before one of his eyes was half closed and he wore a big hat which covered most of his head he suddenly looked interested when i arrived and rubbed his leg in a rather strange way he had just ordered hot rum for the three of them it s lonely country round here gentlemen he said yes said joe just marshes down to the river do people ever spend the night on the marshes no replied joe except an escaped prisoner sometimes difficult to find they are went out to look for one once me and mr wopsle and young pip here didn t we pip yes joe the stranger looked at me with his good eye what s his name pip your son is he the boy is the blacksmith s wife s brother explained mr wopsle in his official church clerk s voice when the drinks arrived the stranger did something that he wanted nobody to see except me he mixed his hot rum and water not with a spoon but with a file which he put back in his pocket when he had finished as soon as i saw the file i knew it was the one i had stolen from joe and i knew that this man knew my convict i stared at him in horror the men continued their conversation in a friendly way until joe stood up to leave and took my hand wait a moment i said the stranger i d like to give the boy something and wrapping a coin in some old paper from his pocket handed it to me that s yours he told me giving me a look full of meaning thank you sir i said still staring at him together joe and i walked home joe with his mouth open all the way so that my sister would not notice the smell of rum on his breath but when we arrived home we found the stranger had giv en me two pound notes as well as the coin my sister thought it must have been a mistake and kept the pound notes in case he came back for them but i knew they came from my con vict and i felt that having criminal friends made me more common than ever the next time i went to miss havisham s i was shown in to a different room to wait several ladies and gentlemen relations of hers were there they all turned and looked at me in disgust when i was the first to be called by estella as estella was leading me along the dark passages she stopped suddenly and put her face close to mine look at me boy am i pretty yes i think you re very pretty am i rude to you not as much as last time she hit my face as hard as she could now you coarse little boy what do you think of me i won t tell you why don t you cry again you fool because i ll never cry for you again i said which was a very false promise because i was crying inside at the time and only i know how much i cried for her later on our way upstairs we met a gentleman coming down in the dark he was a large heavy man with a very dark skin sharp eyes and a huge head almost bald on the top his hands smelt strongly of perfumed soap i didn t know then how important he would ha later on in my life who s this he asked estella stopping to look at me a local boy miss havisham sent for him she replied well in my experience most boys are bad he said to me behave yourself he bit the side of his large finger as he frowned at me and then continued downstairs this time miss havisham was in another room which i had not seen before all the furniture was covered in dust in the candle light i could see a long table in the middle of which was a large yellow shape with hundreds of insects feeding off it this said miss havisham pointing to the table is where they will put me when i m dead i ll lie on the table and my relations can come and look at me she put a bony hand on my shoulder but i didn t want her to touch me i was afraid she would die there and then and that she added pointing to the yellow shape that was my wedding cake mine she looked all round the room angrily come she said suddenly help me walk round the room and call estella i held her arm to support her as she walked we were still going slowly and painfully round the room when estella brought in the relations who had been waiting downstairs they stood watching us at the door i thought they blamed me for miss havisham s cold manner towards them dear miss havisham said one of the ladies lovingly how well you look i do not replied miss havisham sharply i am yellow skin and bone how could miss havisham look well after all her suffer ing said a second lady quickly impossible what a silly idea and how are you miss havisham asked this lady as we were close to her then i would have stopped but miss havisham insisted on walking past it seemed rather rude not well at all said this lady sadly i don t want to talk too much about my feelings but well i often lie awake at night thinking of you dear miss havisham well don t said miss havisham crossly as we hurried past the little group again i m afraid i can t stop myself i often wish i were less sensitive and loving but that s my character and i have to live with it and she started crying softly look at matthew now she added through her tears matthew never comes to see dear miss havisham but i when she heard matthew s name miss havisham stopped walking and stood looking at the speaker who suddenly became silent matthew will come in the end said miss havisham firmly when i die and am laid on that table you will stand around and look at me you here you there you next to her you two there now you know where to stand and now go the ladies and gentlemen went slowly out of the room some protesting quietly that they had not seen enough of their dear relation when they had all gone miss havisham said to me this is my birthday pip i don t allow anyone to speak of it my relations always come on this day once a year this day long before you were born was my wedding day pehaps i shall die on this day too and when they lay me in my wedding dress on that table i ll have my revenge on him in the heavy air of that dark dusty room she was a ghostly figure in her yellow white dress there was a long silence as usual i left the house and walked towards the gate but this time something strange happened in the garden i met a pale young gentleman with fair hair hello he said come and fight this way i was so surprised that i followed him without a word wait a minute he said turning round quickly i must give you a reason for fighting there it is and he pulled my hair then pushed his head hard into my stomach i was ready to fight him after this but he danced abut so much that i couldn t get close to bim follow the laws of the game he said eagerly preparing himself for our fight he seemed to know so much about fighting that i was very surprised when i knocked him down with my first hit and then again with my second he always got up immediately and seemed very glad to be fighting in the correct manner i admired him greatly for his bravery and his cheerfulness finally he had to agree i had won and we said goodbye when i reached the gate i found estella waiting for me she seemed very pleased about something i wondered if she had been watching our fight before i went out she said here you can kiss me if you like i kissed her cheek it was true i wanted to kiss her very much but i felt that kiss was almost like a coin thrown to a poor common boy and not worth anything i didn t see the pale young gentleman there again i continued my visits to miss havisham for almost a year she took great pleasure in watching my growing admiration for estella and my unhappiness when estella laughed at me go on my love she used to whisper in estella s ear break men s hearts and have no mercy i want my revenge meanwhile my sister and that fool pumblechook never stopped discussing miss havisham and her considerable wealth they were sure i could expect a large present from her either before or after her death but one day miss havisham decided it was time to apprentice me to joe and told me to bring him to her house my sister was very angry because she was not invited as well dear old joe simply could not believe his eyes when he and i entered miss havisham s room the next day the darkness the candles the dust the ancient furniture the old lady in her bride s dress it was almost too much for joe s limited intelligence that may be why he refused to speak to miss havisham directly but spoke only to me during the conversation i was ashamed of him especially as i could see estella laughing at me over miss havisham s shoulder so began miss havisham you joe gargery black smith are ready to take pip as an apprentice you know pip replied joe how we ve both been looking forward to working together haven t we pip you don t expect any payment when he becomes your ap prentice she continued now pip said joe rather offended that question doesn t need an answer between you and me does it pip miss havisham looked kindly at joe i think she understood more of his character than estella did she picked up a little bag from the table pip has earned something here there are twenty five pounds in this bag give it to your master pip the strange situation seemed to have made joe go mad even now he insisted on speaking to me this is very generous of you pip very generous now old boy we must try to do our duty to each other mustn t we pip goodbye pip said miss havisham take them out estella shall i come again i asked no gargery is your master now gargery remember i m giving you this money because he has been a good boy don t expect anything more somehow i managed to get joe out of the house and in the daylight he gradually became normal again in fact i think his intelligence was improved by the interview because as we walked home he invented a surprisingly clever plan well cried my sister as we arrived so you ve finished visiting your fine ladies have you i m surprised you bother to come home at all miss havisham asked me to send said joe as if trying to remember the exact words her best wishes was it pip to mrs j gargery best wishes i agreed and apologized for not being well enough what was it pip to have the pleasure i said to have the pleasure of a lady s company he nodded giving the impression of a man glad to pass on a message ocr rectly well said my sister pleased she could have sent that message earlier but better late than never and what did she give the boy nothing said joe firmly stopping mrs joe from speaking by raising his hand what she gave she gave to his sister mrs j gargery that s what she said didn t she pip and how much did she give asked my sister laughing she was actually laughing what would you say to ten pounds asked joe not bad said my sister it s more than that what would you say to twenty pounds that s good said my sister well here you are it s twenty five pounds said joe de lightedly handing the bag to my sister pip s sister is attacked i n a single year everything had changed before i went to miss havisham s and met estella i had always wanted to be apprenticed to joe and i had always been happy at home in spite of my sister s scolding now i was ashamed of my home and my work i was very miserable because of joe however i stayed at the forge and did my best to work hard i m glad that i never told him how unhappy i was then i tried to follow his example and become an honest happy hardworking man but all the time i thought of estella my worst fear was that one day she would come to the forge and see me working as a common blacksmith with black face and hands she would certainly turn away in disgust in the evenings i studied as hard as i could educating my self for estella whatever i learnt i shared with joe not i m afraid so that he would be more educated but so that i would be less ashamed of him in front of estella one sunday joe and i went out on the marshes as usual to study together i don t think he ever remembered anything from one week to the next but he smoked his pipe comfortably looking as intelli gent as he could i had a question i had been intending to ask him joe do you think i should visit miss havisham again well pip said joe will she think you expect her to give you something she told me she wouldn t give you any thing else but joe i ve been apprenticed nearly a year now and i ve never thanked her that s true pip said joe slowly could you give me a half day s holiday tomorrow joe i would like to visit miss est havisham her name isn t estavisham as far as i know pip said joe very seriously i know joe please joe all right pip but if she isn t happy to see you better not go again joe had another blacksmith working for him at the forge his name was orlick and he had no friends or family in the village he was a big strong lazy man who moved about in a strangely unhurried way his shoulders bent and his eyes on the ground for some reason he never liked me even when i was a child and when i became joe s apprentice he seemed to hate me when he heard about my half day holiday he threw down his hammer angrily come now master he said to joe if young pip s having a holiday give me one too well nodded joe after thinking for a moment i will just then my sister who had secretly been listening outside the forge called to joe through one of the windows you fool you think you re a rich man giving a holiday to a lazy man like that orlick i wish i were his master i d soon show him you want to be everybody s master orlick told her angrily and what s more you re a wicked ugly old woman what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream oh oh what did you call me hold me someone little by little she was deliberately making herself angry joe and i had seen this happen many times before hold you said orlick in disgust if you were my wife i d hold you tight round the neck until you couldn t breathe oh screamed my sister me a married woman being spoken to like this in my own house and my husband standing nearby oh oh and like a mad woman she pulled her hair loose and rushed at the forge door which i had luckily locked poor joe had no choice he had to challenge orlick to fight but joe was the strongest man in the village and very soon orlick like the pale young gentleman was lying on the ground then joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped unconscious to the ground but only after watching the fight through the window she stayed in the kitchen for the rest of the day and joe and orlick shared a glass of beer peacefully together in the forge that afternoon when i arrived at miss havisham s house it wasn t estella who opened the gate but a cousin of the old lady s miss havisham looked just the same as before well she said i hope you don t expect me to give you anything no indeed miss havisham i only want you to know that i m very grateful to you for helping me become joe s apprentice good come and see me again on your birthday ah she cried suddenly you re looking for estella aren t you answer ye yes i admitted i hope miss estella is well she s abroad receiving a lady s education she s more beautiful than ever and admired by all who see her do you feel you ve lost her she gave such an unpleasant laugh with these last words that i didn t know what to say and as i left the house i felt even more miserable on my way through town i met mr wopsle and together we started the long walk home to the village it was a dark wet misty night and we could only just see someone ahead of us hello we called is that orlick yes he answered i ll walk home with you been in town all afternoon i have did you hear the big gun firing from the prison ships must be some prisoners who ve escaped that made me think of my convict we didn t talk any more but walked along in silence we heard the gun firing several times it was late by the time we got to the village and we were surprised to see lights on at the pub and people running in and out mr wopsle went in to discover what was happening and after a few minutes rushed out calling something wrong up at the forge pip run they say perhaps it was an escaped convict who got into the house while joe was out someone s been attacked we didn t stop running until we reached the forge in mrs joe s kitchen there was a doctor and joe and a group of women and on the floor in the middle of them all was my sister lying unconscious she would never scold us again joe had been at the pub that evening and when he arrived home just before ten he found her on the floor nothing had been stolen she had been hit violently on the back of the head with a heavy weapon on the floor beside her was a convict s iron chain it did not belong to the prisoners who had escaped that day the police spent the next week investigating the attack but did not arrest anybody i felt sure the iron chain belonged to my convict but i did not think he had attacked my sister the attacker could have been either orlick or the stranger who had shown me the file but several witnesses had seen or lick in town all evening my only reason for suspecting him was his quarrel with my sister but she had quarrelled with everyone in the village ten thousand times and if the stranger had come to ask for his two pounds back my sister would gladly have given it to him so i could not imagine who her attacker was she lay ill in bed for a long time she could not speak or understand much and her character was greatly changed she had become quiet patient and grateful for all our care she used to write a word or draw a picture when she wanted some thing and we tried to discover what she meant she needed someone to take care of her all the time and luckily old mrs wopsle had just died so biddy came to live with us she understood my sister perfectly and looked after us all very well one day my sister drew a t and seemed to want it very much i brought her toast and tea but biddy knew immediately it s not a t it s orlick s hammer she cried she s forgotten his name but she wants to see orlick i must say l expected to see my sister accuse orlick of at tacking her but instead she seemed very pleased to see him she often used to ask for him after that and nobody knew why one sunday i asked biddy to come for a walk on the marshes biddy i said seriously promise to keep this a secret i m going to tell you something i want to be a gentleman don t you think you re happier as you are she replied i had often wondered this myself but i didn t want to hear it from her it s a pity i know i said it would have been much better if i could have been happy working at the forge perhaps you and i would have spent more time together i would have been good enough for you wouldn t i biddy oh yes she said sadly but i don t ask for very much the point is i continued crossly if nobody had told me i was coarse and common i wouldn t have thought abut it biddy looked at me interested that wasn t a true or polite thing to say who said it it was the beautiful young lady at miss havisham s and i admire her greatly and i want to be a gentleman for her the words rushed out before i could stop them biddy said gently she may not be worth the trouble pip that may be true but i can t stop myself admiring her biddy was the most sensible of girls and did not try to persuade me any more as we walked home i felt rested and comforted pip what a fool you are i said to myself i realized how much happier i would always be with biddy than with estella biddy i wish i could make myself fall in love with you i said suddenly you don t mind my speaking so openly as you re such an old friend no of course not but you never will fall in love with me you see she answered a little sadly i wondered if i should continue working with joe in a plain honest way of life and perhaps marry biddy or dare i hope that miss havisham would make my fortune and marry me to estella great expectations one saturday evening when i had been apprenticed to joe for four years he and i were sitting in the pub with some of the villagers listening to mr wopsle he was giving a dramatic reading of a newspaper report of a murder trial and we all enjoyed watching him act the main characters his witnesses were old and feeble his lawyers were clever and sharp eyed and his accused was a violent wicked murderer suddenly we became aware of a strange gentleman who had also been listening and was now looking coldly at us well he said to us biting the side of his finger so you ve decided the accused was the murderer have you sir answered mr wopsle firmly yes i do think he is guilty we all nodded our heads in agreement but said the stranger do you or do you not know that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is proved proved to be guilty sir began mr wopsle as an englishman myself i come said the stranger don t avoid the question either you know it or you don t know it which is it of course i know it answered poor mr wopsle then why didn t you say so at first another question do you know that this trial isn t finished yet mr wopsle hesitated and we all began to have a rather bad opinion of him and you were going to say that the accused was guilty before the end of the trial before he has been proved guilty we realized that the unfortunate wopsle had no understanding of the law or indeed anything at all now the stranger stood in front of our little group i m looking for the blacksmith joe gargery he said and his apprentice pip he did not recognize me but i knew he was the gentleman i had met on the stairs when visiting miss havisham there was even the same smell of per fumed soap on his large hands i want to speak to you two in private he said and so joe and i left the pub and walked home with him my name is jaggers and i m a lawyer he said when he reached the forge joe gargery i am sent by someone who suggests cancelling this boy s apprenticeship to you would you want any money if you lost your apprentice i d never stand in pip s way never said joe staring the answer is no don t try to change that answer later said mr jaggers now what i have to say and remember i m only an agent i don t speak for myself is that this young man has great expectations joe and i gasped and looked at each other i have been told to say that he will be very rich when he is older in addition the person who sent me wants the young man to be removed from his home and educated as a gentleman who expects to inherit a fortune my dream had come true miss havisham was making me rich now mr pip continued the lawyer there are two conditions the first is that you always use the name of pip the second is that the name of the person who has heen so generous to you must remain a secret until that person chooses to tell you you are forbidden to ask any questions or try to discover who the person is do you accept these conditions my heart was beating fast as i whispered yes now to details i have been given enough money for you to live the life of a gentleman in london while you are studying you will come to me to ask for whatever you need i suggest mr matthew pocket as a teacher i remembered that was the name of one of miss havisham s relations the one who did not visit her often you must buy some new clothes shall i leave you twenty pounds he counted twenty coins out of his large purse onto the table and when can you come to london next saturday i agreed feeling very confused he looked at joe who seemed even more confused well joe gargery perhaps i only say perhaps i promise nothing he said throwing his purse carelessly from one hand to another perhaps i have been told to give you a present when you lose your apprentice joe put his great strong hand on my shoulder in the gentlest possible way pip can go freely to fortune and happiness he knows that but if you think that money can ever pay me back for losing the little child who came to the forge and always the best of friends he could not continue dear good joe i was so ready to leave you and so ungrateful to you i can see you now with your strong blacksmith s arm in front of your eyes and your shoulders shaking and tears on your cheeks but at the time i was so excited by my good luck that i forgot what i owed to joe mr jaggers clearly thought joe was a fool for refusing money and left the house reminding me to go straight to his office in london in a week s time joe told biddy what had happened and both congratulated me they were very quiet and sad at first because i would be leaving them but i promised i would never forget them and would often return to visit them biddy tried to explain the good news to my sister but the poor woman could not under stand as joe and biddy became a little more cheerful discussing my possible plans for the future i became more miserable now that i could be a gentleman as i had always wished i was not sure if i wanted to leave my home which was full of happy memories that week passed slowly i took a last walk through the churchyard to the marshes at least i need never think about my convict again no doubt he was dead by now i had something special to ask biddy biddy i said when we were alone don t you think you could teach joe a bit what do you mean teach him asked biddy well i love dear old joe more than anyone else but his education and manners could be improved biddy opened her eyes very wide oh she said so his manners aren t good enough then oh they re all right for here but when i receive my for tune i ll want him to meet important people and behave ocrrectly haven t you ever thought asked biddy not looking at me that he wouldn t want to meet important people he wouldn t want to be taken away from this job that he does well and the village where he s loved now biddy i said crossly are you jealous of my good luck i didn t expect this of you this is a bad side of your character biddy whether you scold me or thank me i ll always do my best for the family at all times and i ll always remember you whatever you think of me said poor biddy i was not pleased with this interview and thought it was strange that the news of my expectations had not made me happier when i went into town to order my new clothes mr pumblechook was waiting for me at the door of his shop my dear friend if you will allow me to call you that he cried shaking both my hands let me congratulate you on your fortune nobody deserves it more than you he seemed so much more sensible than before that i agreed to have lunch with him when i think he said happily that i pumblechook was able to help in my small way by taking you to play at miss remember i stopped him we must never say anything about the person who is being so generous to me don t worry trust me my dear friend have some wine have some chicken oh chicken you didn t think when you were running around on the farm that you would be lucky enough to be served to one who may i may i and he jumped up to shake my hand again as we drank our wine pumblechook reminded me of the happy times he and i had spent together during my childhood i did not remember it quite like that but i began to feel he was a good hearted sincere man he wanted to ask my advice on a business matter he said he was hoping to find a young gentleman who would put money into his business and seemed very interested in my opinion and may i may i he shook hands with me again you know i always used to say that boy will make his fortune he s no ordinary boy he had certainly kept his opinion very secret i thought there was one person i really wanted to visit before going to london dressed in my new clothes i went to miss havisham s house where her cousin opened the gate to me again well pip said miss havisham to me when she saw me i m going to london tomorrow miss havisham i said choosing my words carefully and i wanted to say goodbye i ve been so lucky since i saw you last and i m so grateful for it good good she replied looking delightedly at her cousin who was staring at my new clothes i know about it i ve seen mr jaggers so a rich person has adopted you yes miss havisham she smiled cruelly at her cousin who was looking rather ill remember to do what mr jaggers tells you and you will always keep the name of pip won t you goodbye pip she gave me her hand and i kissed it it seemed the natural thing to do and so i left the old lady in her bride s dress in the candle light with the dusty furniture around her on saturday morning i was in such a hurry that i only said a quick goodbye to my family before setting out to walk the few miles into town for the london coach as i left the peaceful sleeping village the mist over the marshes was rising to show me the great unknown world i was entering suddenly i realized what i was leaving behind my childhood my home and joe then i wished i had asked him to walk with me to the coach and i could not stop crying whenever the horses were changed on the journey i wondered with an aching heart whether to get down and go back to say goodbye properly but the mist had completely risen now and my new world lay ahead of me pip arrives in london at that time everybody in england agreed that london was a wonderful city so i was surprised to find it rather ugly with narrow dirty streets and people crowded into tiny houses i was frightened by its huge size at smith field the meat market i was shocked by the dirt and blood everywhere then i came to newgate prison where a drunk old man showed me the place where prisoners were hanged and told me excitedly that four men would die there tomorrow i was disgusted by this news my first impression of london could not have been worse however i managed to find mr jaggers office noticing that other people were waiting for the great man too after some time he appeared walking towards me his clients all rushed at him together he spoke to some and pushed others away one man held on to the lawyer s sleeve please mr jaggers he begged my brother is accused of stealing silver only you can save him i m ready to pay any thing your brother repeated the lawyer and the trial is to morrow well i m sorry for you and him i m on the other side no mr jaggers cried the man desperately tears in his eyes don t say you re against him i ll pay anything get out of my way said mr jaggers and we left the man on his knees on the pavement now mr jaggers turned to me and told me that on monday i would go to matthew pocket s house to start my studies but until then i would stay with his son herbert who lived near by wemmick mr jaggers clerk showed me the way to mr pocket s rooms he was a short dry man with a square expressionless face between forty and fifty years old his mouth was so wide that it looked like a post box and gave the impression of smiling all the time is london a very wicked place i asked him trying to make conversation as we walked you may be robbed or murdered in london but that may happen to you anywhere if there is any profit in it for the criminal i was not sure whether i looked forward to living in london where people like wemmick accepted crime so calmly we arrived at herbert pocket s rented rooms the building was the dirtiest i had ever seen with broken windows and dusty doors it stood in a little square with dying trees around it i looked in horror at mr wemmick ah he said not understanding my look its quiet position makes you think of the country i quite agree goodbye mr pip i went up the stairs where there was a note on mr pocket s door saying returning soon his idea of soon was not the same as mine about half an hour later i heard footsteps rushing upstairs and a young man of my age appeared breath less at the door mr pip he said i m so sorry i m late i greeted him in a confused manner unable to believe my eyes suddenly he looked closely at me and gasped but you re the boy at miss havisham s and you i said are the pale young gentleman we both started laughing and shook hands well he said i hope you ll forgive me for having knocked you down that day in fact i had knocked him down but i did not contradict him do you know why i was there he asked i had been invited to miss havisham s to see if she liked me i suppose i didn t make a good impression on her if she had liked me i could be a rich man and engaged to estella by now were you disappointed i asked oh i wouldn t want to marry estella she s a hard proud girl and miss havisham has brought her up to break men s hearts as a revenge on all men is she a relation of miss havisham s i asked no only adopted why were you at miss havisham s then to make my fortune the same as you but i was lucky you know mr jaggers is miss havisham s lawyer it was kind of him to suggest that my father should teach you my father is miss havisham s cousin you know herbert pocket made an excellent impression on me he always spoke openly and honestly there was nothing secret or mean in his character and we soon became good friends i told him of my past life in the village and my expectations call me herbert he said would you mind my calling you handel there s a wonderful piece of music by handel called the blacksmith which reminds me of you of course i agreed and as we sat down to dinner herbert told me miss havisham s sad story her mother died young her father was very rich and very proud with only one child miss havisham by his first wife then he married his cook and had a son by her this son a half brother to miss havisham was a bad character and didn t inherit as much from his father as miss havisham did and so perhaps he was angry with her for influencing her father against him anyway a certain man appeared and pretended he was in love with miss havisham she was certainly in love with him and gave him whatever money he asked for my father was the only one of her relations who dared to tell her that this man should not be trusted she was so angry that she ordered my father straight out of the house and he has never seen her since her other relations were not interested in her happiness but only in inheriting her wealth so they said nothing the couple fixed the wedding day the guests were invited the dress and the cake were brought to the house the day came but the man did not he wrote a letter which she received at twenty to nine when she was dressing for her wedding i said yes so she stopped the clocks at that moment she was very ill for a while and since then has not seen daylight people think that her half brother sent the man to get money from her and that he shared the profits perhaps he hated her for inheriting most of the havisham fortune nobody knows what happened to the two men so now you know as much as i do we talked of other things i asked herbert what his profession was oh working in the city he said happily insuring ships there s a lot of money in that you know huge profits i began to think that herbert must have greater expectations than i had where are your ships at the moment i asked admiringly oh i haven t started yet i m working in a counting house just now they don t pay me much but i m looking about me for a good opportunity then i ll make my fortune looking around the room at the old worn furniture i realized that herbert must be very poor and although he seemed full of hope for the future somehow i thought he would never be very rich or successful he and i spent a happy weekend visiting london together although it was all very exciting i could not avoid noticing the dirt and bad smells and heat and i compared it sadly with my village home which now seemed so far away visiting mr wemmick and mr jaggers herbert introduced me to his father who lived the other side of london in hammersmith in the next few months i studied hard with mr pocket who was always a most kind and helpful teacher i divided my time between herbert s and his father s home if i needed money i collected it from wemmick at mr jaggers office and there seemed to be plenty of money available there were two other gentlemen studying at mr pocket s they were quite different from each other bentley drummle came from a rich family living in the country he was lazy proud mean and stupid i much preferred startop who was a pleasant sensitive young man he and i used to row our boats up and down the river together but herbert was my greatest friend and we used to spend most of our time with each other one day when i was collecting my money from wemmick he invited me to his house at walworth a village outside lon don you don t mind walking there mr pip he asked i like to get some exercise if i can for dinner we re having a roast chicken i think it ll be a good one because i got it from one of our clients i always accept any little presents from clients especially if it s cash or anything that can easily be changed into cash you see these rings i m wearing given by clients just before they died all hanged they were by the way i hope you won t mind meeting my aged parent no of course not i said quickly you haven t had dinner with mr jaggers yet wemmick continued he s inviting you and the other three young gentlemen tomorrow there ll be good food and drink at his house but i ll tell you something mr pip when you re there look at his housekeeper why i asked is there something strange about her she s like a wild animal but mr jaggers has trained her oh yes he s stronger and cleverer and more complicated than anyone else in london and you know another strange thing about him he never locks his doors or windows at night isn t he ever robbed i asked in surprise all the thieves in london know where he lives but none of them would dare to rob him they are all afraid of him you see they know he wouldn t rest until he had seen them hanged he s a great man mr pip wemmick s house at walworth was a tiny wooden house in the middle of a garden on top of the roof was a small gun we fire the gun at nine o clock every evening said wemmick proudly and behind the house i call it the castle i keep animals and grow my own vegetables so in case of enemy attack we can always eat our own food what do you think of it i congratulated him on his home he was clearly delighted to show a visitor all his ideas and improvements i do everything myself you know he said it helps me forget the office for a while would you mind being introduced to the aged now he would like it very much so we entered the castle where we found a cheerful old man sitting by the fire well aged parent said wemmick how are you very well john replied the old man nodding happily here s mr pip aged parent nod your head at him mr pip he s completely deaf but he likes to see people nod at him this is a fine house of my son s sir cried the old man nodding back at me it should be kept by the nation for the public to visit after my son s death you re proud of it aren t you aged said wemmick his face losing all its usual hardness as he looked at the old man i hope mr jaggers admires your home mr wemmick i asked he s never been here never met the aged never been invited no the office is one thing and private life is another at the office i never speak of the castle and at the castle i don t think about the office the aged was obviously looking forward to the evening ceremony of firing the gun at nine o clock exactly wemmick fired it as the tiny house shook the aged jumped up and down in his armchair crying excitedly i heard it that s the gun supper was excellent and i spent the night in the smallest bedroom i had ever seen next morning as wemmick and i walked back to london i noticed his face becoming dryer and harder and his mouth becoming more like a post box again when we arrived at the office nobody could have guessed that he had a home or an aged parent or any interests at all out side his work wemmick was right in saying that mr jaggers would invite me to dinner startop drummle herbert and i were asked to go to the office at six o clock the next evening there we found jaggers washing his hands and face carefully with per fumed soap he did this every evening before going home he seemed to be washing away his clients and his work like dirt we all walked to his house together the housekeeper brought in the first dish she was about forty with a strange wild expression on her pale face she seemed almost afraid of her master and looked anxiously at him whenever she entered the room the food was indeed very good and the conversation was cheerful but somehow mr jaggers made us all show the worst side of our characters and encouraged drummle who we all disliked to annoy us when drummle stupidly said that he was stronger than any of us we all protested foolishly showing each other our muscles to prove how strong we were suddenly mr jaggers clapped his large hand on the housekeeper s as she was removing a dish we stopped talking immediately gentlemen he said look at my housekeeper here she is stronger than any of you molly show them your wrists no please master she begged trying to pull away but he held her hand firmly show them molly he said and she held her wrists out to us i ve never seen stronger hands than these he said there was silence for a few minutes all right molly you can go he said and she hurried out during the rest of the dinner mr jaggers continued to enjoy watching us quarrelling with drummle he gave the impression surprisingly of liking drummle very much but i was glad when the dinner was over and herbert and i could walk quietly back to our rooms together a visit from joe my dear pip mr gargery asks me to tell you he will be in lon don soon and could visit you at o clock on tuesday morning at mr herbert pocket s rooms if that is all right with you he and i talk about you every night and wonder what you are saying and doing best wishes biddy p s i hope you will not refuse to see him even though you are a gentleman now he is such a good man i received this letter on monday and realized that joe would arrive the next day i am sorry to confess that i did not look forward to seeing him at all if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly would have paid money i knew that his clothes his manners and uneducated way of speaking would make me ashamed of him luckily herbert would not laugh at him at nine o clock the next morning i heard joe s clumsy boots on the stairs and at last he entered herbert s rooms pip how are you pip he shook both my hands together his good honest face shining with happiness i m glad to see you joe give me your hat but joe insisted on holding it carefully in front of him he was wearing his best suit which did not fit him at all well what a gentleman you are now pip and you look wonderfully well joe yes thank god and your poor sister is no worse and biddy is as hard working as ever but wopsle isn t our church clerk any longer he s become an actor acting in one of your london theatres he is joe s eyes rolled around the room noticing the expensive furniture i had bught recently do sit down to breakfast mr gargery said herbert politely joe looked round desperately for a place to put his hat and finally laid it lovingly on a shelf breakfast was a painful experience for me joe waved his fork in the air so much and dropped so much more than he ate that i was glad when her bert left to go to work i was not sensitive enough to realize that it was all my fault and that if i hadn t considered him common he wouldn t have been so clumsy as we are now alone sir began joe joe i said crossly how can you call me sir he looked at me quietly for a moment wouldn t have come you see he said slowly and carefully wouldn t have had the pleasure of breakfast with you gentlemen but i had to come got a message for you pip miss havisham says es tella s come home and would be glad to see you i felt the blood rush to my face as i heard her name and now i ve given my message said joe standing up and picking up his hat pip i wish you even more success but you aren t leaving already joe i protested yes i am he said firmly our eyes met and all the sir melted out of his honest heart as he gave me his hand pip dear old boy life is full of so many goodbyes i m a blacksmith and you re a gentleman we must live apart i m not proud it s just that i want to be in the right place i m wrong in these clothes and i m wrong in london but i m fine at the forge or in the kitchen or on the marshes you won t find so much wrong with me if you come to see joe the blacksmith at the old forge doing the old work i know i m stupid but i think i ve understood this at last and so god bless you pip dear old boy god bless you his words spoken simply and from the heart touched me deeply by the time i had managed to control my tears and looked round for him he had gone i decided to visit miss havisham as soon as possible next day when i arrived to take my seat on the coach to our town i discovered i was sitting in front of two convicts who were being taken to the prison ships by their guard the prisoners wore handcuffs and iron chains on their legs with horror i suddenly recognized one of them it was the man in our village pub who had given me the two pound notes and strangely enough during the journey i heard the prisoners talking about it so magwitch asked you to give the boy two pounds trusted you to do it that s right and i did what he asked the boy had helped him you see fed him and kept his secret what happened to magwitch in the end they sent him to australia for life because he tried to es cape from the prison ship i knew i looked so different that he would not recognize me but i was afraid all the same all the horror of my child hood experience with the escaped convict had come back to me just when i thought it was safe to forget it but once we had arrived and i was on my way to miss havisham s house i thought only of my bright future she had adopted estella she had more or less adopted me she perhaps wanted me to inherit the dark old house and to marry estella but even though i was in love i didn t hide from myself the fact that i would be unhappy with estella i loved her because i couldn t stop myself loving her i was surprised to see orlick opening the gate to me so you aren t working for joe any longer i asked as you see young master he said rudely i knew he could not be trusted and i decided to tell mr jaggers that orlick was not responsible enough to work for miss havisham mr jaggers would probably send him away when i entered miss havisham s room there was a well dressed lady sitting with her when she lifted her head and looked at me i realized it was estella she had become so beautiful that i felt very distant from her in spite of all my education i still seemed to be the coarse common boy she used to laugh at she s changed very much hasn t she pip asked miss havisham laughing wickedly i replied confusedly i could see that estella was still proud and i knew that it was she who made me feel ashamed of home and joe but i also knew that i could never stop loving her she and i walked in the ancient garden talking quietly about our childhood meetings now that we were adults she seemed to accept me as a friend i could not have been happier i felt sure miss havisham had chosen us for each other what a fool i was suddenly she stopped and turned to me miss havisham may want us to spend more time together in future but in that case i must warn you that i have no heart i can never fall in love i can t believe that i replied as she looked straight at me i recognized something in her face had i seen that ex pression recently on another woman when we went back to the house miss havisham spoke to me alone do you admire her pip she asked eagerly everbody who sees her must admire her she pulled my head down to hers with her bony arm and whispered love her love her love her if she likes you love her if she hurts you love her if she tears your heart to pieces love her i could feel the muscles on her thin arm round my neck she seemed so angry that she could have been talking about hate or revenge or death rather than love pip and herbert talk about love i returned to london dreaming of the beautiful girl now a woman who had so influenced my childhood and who i hoped would share my future life i am sorry to say i did not think about dear good joe at all i felt i had to ex press my feelings to someone and so that evening i told herbert my secret instead of being surprised as i expected my friend replied i know that already handel you never told me but it was obvious you ve always loved estella it s very lucky that you seem to have been chosen to marry her does she er admire you i shook my head sadly not at all and herbert you may think me lucky i have great expectations i know but all that depends on one person and i still don t really know how much i ll receive or when nothing is certain now handel said herbert cheerfully don t lose hope mr jaggers himself told you you would have a large fortune didn t he he would never make a mistake about something like that anyway you ll be twenty one soon perhaps you ll discover more then thank you herbert i said feeling much better but i want to ask you something my dear handel said herbert looking serious for once think of estella and her education and how unhappy you may be with her couldn t you possibly and i m saying this as a friend remember couldn t you forget about her i know you re right herbert i said miserably but i can never stop loving her well never mind said herbert now i have something to tell you myself i am engaged may i ask the young lady s name clara her mother s dead and she lives with her father we must keep our feelings for each other secret because i haven t enough money to marry her yet as soon as i start in suring ships we can marry herbert tried to look hopeful about his future but this time he couldn t even manage his usual cheerful smile one day i received a letter which made my heart beat fast i am coming to london the day after tomorrow by the mid day coach miss havisham wants you to meet me estella if there had been time i would have ordered several new suits i ate nothing until the day arrived and all morning i waited impatiently for the coach she seemed more beautiful than ever and her manner to me was very pleasant as i took her to the house in london where miss havisham had arranged for her to stay her life seemed to be planned by miss havisham right down to the smallest detail i only hoped i was part of that plan pip attends a burial one evening a black edged envelope was delivered to me at herbert s rooms the letter inside informed me that mrs j gargery had died the previous monday and that the burial would be next monday at p m this news came as a shock to me it was the first time that someone close to me had died and i could not imagine life without my sister even if i had never loved her or even thought about her recently i arrived at the forge early on monday afternoon joe was sitting in the front room wrapped in a black cloak dear joe how are you i asked pip dear old boy you knew her when she was a fine woman and he could say no more biddy in her neat little black dress was busy serving food old friends from the village were talking quietly among them selves and i noticed the awful pumblechook trying to catch my eye as he drank brandy and swallowed large pieces of cake may i my dear sir may i he asked his mouth full and shook my hand enthusiastically my sister s dead body was carried slowly out of the house and through the village followed by all of us we could see the marshes and the sails of ships on the river and there in the churchyard next to my unknown parents my poor sister was laid quietly in the earth while the birds sang and the clouds danced in the sky biddy joe and i felt better when all the guests had gone and we had a quiet supper together i decided to spend the night at the forge which pleased joe very much i was pleased with myself for offering to do so i waited until i found biddy alone then i said i suppose you won t be able to stay here now will you biddy no mr pip i ll stay in the village but i ll still look after mr gargery as much as i can how are you going to live biddy if you want any money i m going to be the village schoolteacher she said quickly her cheeks pink i can earn my own money tell me biddy how did my sister die she had been worse than usual when one evening she said very clearly joe and so i ran to the forge to fetch him and she put her arms round his neck and laid her head on his shoulder quite happy once she said sorry and once pip she never lifted her head up again and an hour later she died biddy cried and i cried too what happened to orlick biddy he s still in the village he doesn t work for miss havisham any more you know he he follows me sometimes you must tell me if he bothers you biddy i ll be here more often now i m not going to leave poor joe alone biddy said nothing come biddy what do you mean by this silence are you quite sure then that you will come to see him oh biddy i said sadly this really is a bad side to your character don t say any more and that evening i thought how unkind how unjust biddy was to me next morning i looked in at the forge before leaving and said goodbye to joe who was already hard at work i shall be back to see you soon joe never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip as i walked away i think i knew that i would not go back biddy was right in london i did some serious thinking i could see that my character had not improved since i had heard about my expectations i was spending far too much money what was worse i was a bad influence on herbert who was also spend ing too much i would have offered to pay his bills but he was too proud to listen to such a suggestion i had hoped that on my twenty first birthday i would discover more about my future but mr jaggers explained that he could not give me any more information except that from now on i would have five hundred pounds a year to spend as i liked i suddenly thought of a way i could help herbert when l asked wemmick if he could advise me on how to help a friend start up in business his post box mouth opened wide choose one of the six london bridges he said and throw your money over it that s better than investing money for a friend that s my official opinion of course ah so you would give me a different opinion at walworth you ll be welcome there mr pip on private business next sunday i visited wemmick and his aged parent at the castle this time there was a lady called miss skiffins clearly a regular visitor who made the tea and sat next to wemmick on the sofa when he and i were alone wemmick listened carefully to my request and after thinking hard found an answer with his help i arranged to invest some money in a shipping company called clarrikers finally i signed an agreement with them in which they promised to offer herbert a job and later to make him a partner at last i felt that my expectations had done some good to someone pip discovers the truth while estella lived in london staying with friends of miss havisham s i often visited her she had an endless stream of admirers and i was jealous of all of them i never had an hour s happiness with her but i still thought about her day and night and my dearest wish was to marry her several times miss havisham ordered me to bring estella to visit her and of course i always obeyed estella was as proud and cold as ever with her admirers with miss havisham and with me one man who admired her and followed her everywhere was the unpleasant bentley drummle one day i asked her about him estella why do you encourage someone like drummle you know very well he s stupid and nobody likes him don t be foolish pip she answered perhaps i encourage him because that has a certain effect on the others but he isn t worth it i cried angrily what difference does it make she answered tiredly if i smile at him it s because it means nothing to me you should be glad that i don t give you false looks or smiles at least i am always honest with you but while my heart was aching for estella i had no idea that i would soon be hit by a disaster which would completely destroy my hopos and dreams the chain of events which had begun before i ever met her was slowly reaching its end herbert and i had moved to rooms in a house by the river in the temple area one evening he was abroad on business and i was alone at home reading it was terrible weather stormy and wet with deep mud in the streets the wind rushing up the river shook the whole building and the rain beat violently against the windows as i closed my book at eleven o clock i heard a heavy footstep on the stairs when i went to the door with my lamp i saw a man coming slowly upstairs he was wearing rough clothes and he was about six ty with a brown face and long grey hair but what really surprized me was that he was holding out both hands to me can i help you i asked politely but coldly ah yes he said dropping his hands yes i ll explain he came into the sitting room where he looked round admiringly at my furniture and books he held out his hands to me again but i refused to take them then he sat down heavily in a chair and rubbed his eyes with one rather dirty hand you see he said it s disappointing looked forward to this day for so long i have but it s not your fault i ll explain is there anybody near who can hear us why do you a stranger visiting me late at night ask that question i asked and then suddenly i knew who he was in spite of the years that had passed i was sure he was my convict and when he held out his hands again this time i took them he raised my hands to his lips and kissed them you helped me all those years ago pip never forgotten it he seemed to want to put his arms around me but i stopped him if you are grateful to me for what i did in my childhood i hope you have improved your way of life now it wasn t necessary to come here to thank me but you must understand that i stopped speaking as i noticed how strangely he was staring at me what must i understand he asked his eyes fixed on me that i don t wish to be your friend you and i met once in the past but now our lives are separate will you have a drink before you leave as i handed him a glass of rum i noticed that his eyes were full of tears i m sorry if that sounds hard l added i didn t mean it to be good luck in the future we drank together how have you been living recently i was sent to australia you know because i escaped from the prison ship after several years i finished my punishment and so i was allowed to work for myself i did every kind of job there it was a hard life but i made a lot of money i m glad to hear it i said that reminds me i must give you back the two pounds you sent me i don t need it now and i handed him two new pound notes from my purse still watching me he held them near the lamp until they caught fire may i ask he said how you have done so well since you and i met on those lonely marshes his eves were still fixed on mine and i began to tremble i i ve been chosen to inherit a fortune i whispered perhaps i can guess how much said the convict could it be well five hundred pounds a year i stood up holding on to the back of my chair my heart beating like a hammer the agent who arranged it all he continued was he perhaps a lawyer name of jaggers suddenly i realized the awful truth i could not speak nor breathe and fell on to the sofa he brought his fierce old face close to mine and bent over me yes pip dear boy i ve made a gentleman of you you see i promised myself that all the money i earned out there in australia should go to you i m your second father pip i m not a gentleman myself and i didn t go to school but i ve got you pip and look what a gentleman you are and what books you ve got you ll read them to me pip and i ll be proud of you even if i can t understand them didn t you ever think it could be me who was sending the money oh no no no i replied never never wasn t any one else involved at all no just me and jaggers of course who else could there be dear boy i kept myself going you see through all the hard work just by thinking of you and i promised myself i d come back to england one day and see my boy he laid his band on my shoulder now you must find a bed for me he added and remember not a word to anybody i was sent away for life and they ll hang me if they discover i ve come back my feelings were horribly confused the man who had paid for my education and luxuries for years was risking his life to see me i could not like him in fact my whole body trembled with disgust when he touched me but i had to protect him he went to sleep in herbert s room after locking all the doors carefully i sat weakly down by the fire and tried to make sense of my life how foolish my dreams had been miss havisham had never intended to make me rich or let me marry estella but there was something worse than that it was for this convict who could be caught and hanged at any moment that i had deserted joe i could never never never forgive myself for that planning magwitch s futureand hearing about his past i slept a little but woke early i felt i needed some fresh air and went downstairs and out of the building on the way down i fell over a man hiding in a dark corner who ran away immediately this worried me i suspected he had followed my convict to the house would he now inform the police my guest and i had breakfast together he ate noisily and greedily like an animal i tried hard not to be disgusted by his manners he told me his name was abel magwitch and after breakfast he lit his pipe and held out his hands for mine again all i want is to stand and look at you dear boy he said a real gentleman made by me you re going to have every thing a london gentleman should have a carriage and horses and everything he threw a great thick wallet on to the table all that is yours i ve come back to england to watch you spend it stop i cried desperately we must discuss your plans how long are you going to stay here how long he repeated surprised i m not going back but where will yon be safe dear boy who knows i m here you jaggers and wemmick that s all anyway i know i can live with the fear of death i ve done that all my life all i knew was that i must keep him out of sight until herbert returned then we could produce a better plan for the future i decided to rent a room for him in a house near ours where i thought he would be safe for the moment i bought him different clothes and had his hair cut but to me he looked just the same and i lived in constant fear that he would he recognized by someone who had known him in the past my unwanted guest and i spent five long days and evenings together with the wind and rain beating on the windows those few days seemed more like a year to me he slept or ate or played cards sometimes he listened to me reading with a proud smile on his face i could not sleep or eat i used to watch him sleep wondering what bloody crimes lay in his past and knowing that i alone protected him from a horrible death i cannot describe my joy when herbert finally returned at last i could share my terrible news with my friend he too was shocked to hear that my great expectations came from the prisoner i had helped so long ago and when i introduced him to our guest herbert could hardly hide his dislike when we were alone he said to me you look so pale handel this has been a painful time for you herbert something must be done he wants to spend even more on me he must be stopped you mean you can t accept any more of his money how can i you know he s a criminal how do i know where his money comes from and think what i owe him al ready i have no way of paying him back oh herbert if i didn t have you as a friend i d be desperate i could only just control my tears herbert kindly pretended not to notice my dear handel he said if you want to pay back what you owe him you could always join my company clarrikers i m going to be a partner there soon you know poor her bert he did not suspect whose money was helping him be come a partner but there s another thing added herbert this man has a fierce and violent character he s come here with a fixed idea which he s been looking forward to for half his life if you destroy his idea his life will be worthless and he will allow himself to be arrested and hanged i continued nodding yes i ve thought that ever since he arrived if that happened i d feel guilty for ever so you cannot destroy his dream now first we must get him out of england where he risks death every moment then you will explain that you can t accept his money i ll help you all the way trust me i shook herbert s hand gratefully next morning after breakfast we asked magwitch to tell us more about his past life so that we could protect him better you promise to keep it a secret pip s friend he said to herbert well i ll put it in a few words in prison and out of prison that s been my life more or less don t remember my parents no idea where i was born i slept in fields i stole food sometimes i worked and i grew to be a man it was about twenty years ago i met compeyson i d kill him now at once if i met him he s the man i was fighting when the soldiers found me on the marshes pip he was handsome and educated so people thought he was a gentleman and trusted him i was a partner in his business and a dirty business it was too we persuaded rich people to invest their money with us we used stolen banknotes we wrote false cheques compeyson was clever but what a wicked cold hear the had he always got the profits but never the blame his former partner arthur lived in compeyson s house and was very ill in fact he was dying he and compeyson had got a lot of money out of a rich lady some years before and arthur kept dreaming of this lady late one night he appeared at the sitting room door pale and shaking crying compeyson she s there in my room all dressed in white ready for the wedding she s angry she says she wants revenge you brobke her heart you know you did and now she say i m going to die compeyson and his wife put arthur back to bed but at five o clock in the morning we heard screams coming from his room and he died soon after i should have realized it was a mistake getting involved with compeyson in the end we were both arrested for several crimes and what happened at the trial he lied and lied i was the criminal in and out of prison all my life and i got fourteen years on the prison ship he was the gentleman of good character and with important friends and only got seven years magwitch had become very excited and had to breathe deeply to calm himself i promised myself i d smash his handsome face when i saw him on the prison ship i was just going to when a guard caught hold of me i managed to escape by diving into the river that s how i reached the marshes and the churchyard and then pip my boy you told me compeyson was on the marshes too he must have escaped like me so i hunted him and smashed his face and i was going to take him back to the prison ship so that he wouldn t have the pleasure of being free when the soldiers caught us again he was clever his punishment for escaping was light but i was brought to trial again and sent to australia for life is compeyson dead i asked after a silence heard no more of him he said shaking his head but if he s alive he hopes i m dead that s certain herbert passed me a note he had been writing it said the name of miss havisham s half brother was arthur compeyson is the man who pretended to be in love with her pip visits estella and miss havisham again before taking magwitch abroad i felt i must see both estella and miss havisham when i visited estella s london home i found she had gone to stay with miss hav isham and so leaving magwitch in herbert s care i went by coach to the town i knew so well before walking to miss havisham s i went to the hotel for breakfast it was an unpleasant shock to discover bentley drummle there but i could imagine his reason for visiting the area when he noticed me he immediately called to the waiter making sure i could hear listen you the lady isn t going riding today and remember i m not having dinner here tonight i ll be at the lady s and drummle smiled wickedly at me knowing that what he said cut me to the heart he went out shouting for his horse if he had spoken estella s name i would have hit him i was so angry with him and so depressed about my future that i could not eat the breakfast instead i went straight to the old house i found miss havisham and estella sitting in the same room with candles burning as usual miss havisham i said i must tell you that i m as unhappy as you ever wanted me to be i ve discovered who has been paying for my education now i know i shall never be rich or important i cannot tell you any more it isn t my secret but another person s i stopped considering what to say next go on said miss havisham looking interested i thought it was you miss havisham and you encouraged me in my mistake why should i be kind to anybody after all i ve suffered cried miss havisham angrily yes you re right i said quickly to calm her but you also encouraged your relations to think i would inherit some of your fortune why shouldn t i she cried wildly but matthew pocket and his son are different they aren t selfish or greedy they re generous and honest i want you to know that she looked carefully at me what do you want for them i m asking for money i replied my cheeks red i would like you to help my friend herbert become a partner in his company i started paying for this myself two years ago and i want to keep it a secret from him but now i find i can t continue the payments i can t explain why it s part of the other person s secret miss havisham looked at the fire and then at me again what else she asked turning to estella i tried to control my trembling voice you know i love you estella i said i have loved you long and dearly she shook her head i know i know i have no hope of ever marrying you estella but i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house it was cruel of miss havisham to encourage me to hope but i don t think she meant to be unkind what you say said estella very calmly doesn t touch my heart i can t feel love as you do and i ve warned you of this haven t i yes i answered miserably but i couldn t believe it it s the way i ve been brought up estella bentley drummle is in town here you go riding with him don t you is he having dinner with you tonight it is all true she answered a little surprised you cannot love him estella i cried didn t you listen i can never love anyone and then she added but why not tell you the truth i m going to marry him i covered my face with my hands after a moment i lifted my head and cried dont t throw yourself away on an animal like him even if you won t marry me there must be others who love you any of them would be a thousand times better than drummle i can t marry a man who expects me to love him so drummle will do well enough as my husband you will soon forget me never estella you are part of myself you are in every line i ve read in every view i ve seen in every dream i ve dreamt to the last hour of my life you will remain part of me god bless you and god forgive you i held her hand to my lips for a moment as i left estella s lovely face looked at me in wonder but miss havisham was staring at me with a mixture of pity and guilt it was all over to calm my feelings i walked all the way back to london at night the temple gates were always closed but the night porter let me in when i told him my name he gave me an envelope addressed to mr pip inside in wemmick s writing it said don t go home shelter for magwitch i spent a restless night at a hotel worrying about the reasons for wemmick s warning early in the morning i went to see him at the castle he told me he had heard i was being watched and that someone was looking for magwitch he also knew that compeyson was alive and in london while i was absent wemmick had warned herbert to move our guest to a safer place clara the girl herbert was in love with lived with her old father in a house on the river quite near the open sea and herbert had arranged to rent rooms for magwitch in this house it was further away from the centre of london and our home and we could easily take magwitch abroad by boat from there our friend is there now said wemmick and you can visit him tonight but don t go back there after that and re member mr pip he added firmly remember to get his cash you don t know what may happen to him don t let anything happen to his cash i could not explain to wemmick how i felt about magwich s money so i said nothing that evening i visited the house and met clara a lovely girl obviously in love with herbert how lucky she and herbert were i thought of estella and felt very sad magwitch seemed quieter and more likeable than the last time i had seen him he accepted all our arrangements for him gratefully i was almost sorry to say goodbye to him i decided to keep a rowing boat near our rooms so that her bert or i could row up and down the river as far as clara s house if magwitch saw us on the river he could draw his bedroom curtain to show everything was all right for the next few weeks life went on as normal herbert went to work and visited clara in the evenings i rowed on the river and waited for news from wemmick one evening instead of reading alone in my room i went to the theatre where mr wopsle was acting he noticed me in the audience and kept looking at me in a very strange way after the play we met outside the theatre and he asked immediately you didn t see that man sitting right behind you mr pip i felt suddenly cold who was he i asked you remember mr pip that christmas day when you were a boy we went on to the marshes with the soldiers and found the escaped convicts fighting each other well one of those two was looking over your shoulder tonight which one i asked holding my breath the one with the bleeding face he answered so compeyson was still following me i knew magwitch was in great danger later that evening herbert and i discussed the problem and promised each other to be more careful than ever about a week later i met mr jaggers by chance in the street and he invited me to dinner that evening wemmick was there too mr jaggers told me miss havisham wished to see me on business so i said i would go the next day then jaggers said well pip our friend drummle has won a great prize he has married estella i had been expecting this news for some time but it still came as a terrible shock i wonder continued jaggers who will be the stronger in the end the wife or the husband he may beat her surely he isn t wicked enough to do that i cried he may or he may not but she is certainly more intelligent than him we shall see just then i noticed the housekeeper putting a dish on the table i stared at her i had seen exactly such eyes and such hands very recently and suddenly i was absolutely certain that this woman was estella s mother later as wemmick and i left jaggers house together i asked him about his employer s housekeeper he told me that many years before she had been jealous of her husband and another woman and had been accused of murdering this woman jaggers was her lawyer and at her trial he managed to show that she was not strong enough to kill anyone she was also suspected of killing her three year old daughter who had disappeared but because of jaggers clever arguing she was judged innocent of murder aftef the trial she left her husband and became jaggers housekeeper miss havisham realizes how pip has suffered when i went to see miss havisham the next day as she had requested her house looked darker than ever and i realized how lonely she was without estella she looked sadly at me tell me pip she said stretching out her hand to me how can i help your friend you said something about it last time i explained my agreement with clarrikers to make herbert a partner nine hundred pounds still had to be paid and you will be happier if i pay this much happier can t i help you yourself pip there is nothing you can do i answered she wrote a cheque which she handed to me mr jaggers will give you the money and here pip handing me another piece of paper here is a note with my name on if one day you can write under my name i forgive her please do it oh miss havisham i said i can do it now we have all made mistakes i can t be bitter with anyone what have i done pip she cried dropping to her knees in front of me i should never have brought up estella like that or allowed you to be hurt could i ask you something about estella how and why did you adopt her i never knew her parents she said quietly i asked jaggers to find a little girl for me to adopt and he brought estella here when she was about three we had no more to say to each other and so i left but on my way through the old garden i had a strange feeling that something was wrong and i ran back upstairs to check that miss havisham was all right as i opened the door of her room i saw her sitting close to the fire suddenly a great flame lit the room she turned and rushed towards me screaming her hair and clothes on fire somehow i managed to cover her with my coat and put out the flames with my hands i sent for a doctor who cleaned her wounds her bed was placed on the great dining table where her wedding cake had been and she lay there covered with a white sheet half con scions i could not stay but left her in the care of the doctor and several nurses and returned to london my hands and right arm had been badly burnt but al though i was in great pain i was desperate to know if mag witch was safe everything s fine handel herbert told me calmly as he gently put bandages on my hands he seems much pleasanter than before i actually like him now do you know yesterday he was telling me about his past apparently at one time he was married to a young woman who was jealous of an other woman there was a fight and his wife killed the other luckily for her she had a clever lawyer at her trial and was never punished for the murder she and magwitch had a daughter who magwitch dearly loved both wife and child disappeared after the trial and he thought his wife must have killed their daughter how old was the child i asked trying to control my excitement she would have been about your age if she had lived herbert i said am i ill or mad or anything no replied herbert after examining me carefully al though you do look a little excited listen herbert magwitch is estella s father the next day although i felt ill and weak because of my burns i went straight to jaggers office he admitted that estella was his housekeeper s daughter adopted by miss hav isham to give her the chance of a better life but even he the great jaggers did not know that magwitch was estella s father pip is close to death i paid clarrikers miss havisham s nine hundred pounds and felt glad that herbert s future at least was safe clarrikers were going to send herbert to india to open a new office there so while helping my old friend i would be losing him at the same time wemmick advised us to move magwitch out of the country in the middle of the week so we decided to row the boat down to clara s house on wednesday collect magwitch and continue right down the river to essex where we could stop one of the foreign ships sailing from the port of london to ger many or holland with luck nobody would notice us or sus pect us our friend startop agreed to row instead of me as my hands were still too painful however when i went back to our rooms on monday my head full of arrangements for the journey i found a letter ad dressed to me and delivered by hand it said if you want information about your guest you should come tonight or tomorrow night to the old house near the lime kiln on the marshes tell no one you must come alone i did not have time to consider i rushed out again and was just in time to catch the afternoon coach i stopped in town only to ask about miss havisham she was still very ill it seemed then i walked fast on to the dark lonely marshes soon i arrived at the lime kiln which was still burning although the workmen had all gone home i pushed open the door of the old house which i thought was uninhabited but to my surprise there was a bed a table and a candle inside suddenly the candle was blown out i was at tacked from behind and my arms were tied close to my sides with a thick rope the pain in my injured arm was terrible in a moment the candle was lit again and i recognized my at tacker orlick i saw he had been drinking and i knew i was in a very dangerous situation now he said fiercely i ve got you why have you brought me here i asked don t yon know he replied drinking straight from a bottle because you re my enemy i lost that job at miss havisham s because of you and what s more biddy would have liked me if you hadn t been there you ve been in my way ever since you were a child and now i m going to have your life tonight you re going to die i felt i was looking down into my own grave i could see no possible way of escape more than that he said i don t want anything left of you i ll put your body in the kiln even your clothes will be burnt and in the morning there ll be nothing left i realized i had not told anybody where i was going no body would know where to look for me another thing he said smiling cruelly it was your fault your ugly sister was attacked i did it i hit her with the iron chain your convict left on the marshes but i did it be cause i hated you he drank again i watched the level of the liquid go down i knew that when he finished the bottle my life would end and i know all about that convict you re hiding i ve waited and watched outside your rooms and on the stairs you fell over me once i ve got a friend who s going to inform the police about him yes compeyson ll make sure he s hanged when you re dead the last of the rum went down his throat and picking up his hammer he came towards me determined to fight i shouted as loudly as i could suddenly the door was thrown open and herbert and startop rushed in with a violent shout orlick jumped over the table and escaped into the night my two friends had found orlick s letter to me which in my hurry i had dropped in my room in london they had suspected some wicked plot and come straight to the town and then to the marshes to find me luckily they had arrived just in time they took me back to london that night and looked after me carefully all the next day so that although my arm was still aching and i felt very weak i was fit enough for the planned journey on wednesday the end of magwitch s story it was a cold bright morning when we set out cheerfully down the river i steered the boat herbert and startop rowed at clara s house magwitch was waiting for us wrapped in a dark cloak dear boy he said putting his hand on my shoulder as he sat down heavily in the boat thank you we rowed eastwards down the river all day looking round all the time to check that no one was following us magwitch seemed quite happy smoking his pipe and watching the water you don t know what a pleasure it is to me pip he said once to be with my dear boy in the open air you ll be completely safe and free tomorrow i said i hope so dear boy but looking into the frture well that s like looking for the bottom of the river isn t it can t be done he remained silent after that we decided to spend the night at a little riverside pub it seemed safe because there were no other guests but the pub owner asked us a question which worried us did you see that boat go past gentlemen rowed by four men with two others on board it s been up and down the river several times could be a customs boat when he left us alone we discussed this information in whispers in the end we decided to go to bed and then set out the next morning just in time to catch the ship to hamburg i woke early and when i looked out of the window i saw two men examining our boat but i decided not to wake herbert or startop who needed their rest after rowing all the previous day late in the morning we rowed into the centre of the river we could see the ship to hamburg coming closer magwitch and i picked up our bags and said goodbye to herbert and startop so that we would be ready to stop the ship and get on board suddenly a boat rowed by four men appeared from nowhere and came out very fast into the centre of the river close to us a fifth man was steering and a sixth his face hidden in his cloak whispered instructions to the steerer they all stared at us you have a convict there who s returned from australia shouted the steerer that s the man in the cloak his name is abel magwitch i m a customs officer and i arrest him suddenly their boat was touching ours the hamburg ship was almost on top of us and the ship s captain shouted the or der to stop engines but it was too late at the same moment the customs officer put his hand on magwitch s shoulder and magwitch pulled the cloak off the other man in the boat it was compeyson and as i watched he fell backwards into the water his face full of terror the huge ship hit our tiny boat with a great crash somehow the customs officers managed to get me on board their boat with herbert and startop but our boat sank and the two convicts had disappeared soon however we discovered magwitch in the water badly injured and pulled him into the boat he told me that he had fallen into the water with compeyson and then been hit by the ship i believed what he said at the time there was no sign of compeyson whose dead body was found several days later magwitch was taken to prison to wait for his trial i arranged for jaggers to be his lawyer but jaggers warned me there was almost no hope of saving his life magwitch s thick wallet was handed over to the police and wemmick was quite annoyed with me about it really mr pip to lose so much cash he said you see compeyson was so determined to get his revenge that you couldn t have saved magwitch but you certainly could have saved the cash that s the difference but could i ask you something mr pip would you come for a walk with me on monday morning it seemed a strange request and although i did not really feel like accepting he politely insisted i arrived at the castle early on monday morning and after a glass of rum and milk we set out on the road well well said wemmick suddenly here s a church let s go in and when we were inside there was another surprise well well he said again look what i ve found in my pockets let s put them on as he had found two pairs of white gloves and his post box mouth was as wide as it could possibly be i began to suspect something and when i saw the aged come in with a lady i knew i was right well well said wemmick still pretending to be sur prised here s the aged and miss skiffins let s have a wedding and so wemmick was married to miss skiffins and we all celebrated afterwards at a little pub near the church i was delighted for wemmick but i could not stop worrying about magwitch he had been so badly injured that he was moved to the prison hospital where i visited him every day i read to him and talked to him and did everything i could to make him comfortable but day by day i watched him becom ing weaker although he never complained to the prison guards he was a dangerous criminal but to me he was an un fortunate man who had at least some goodness in him i could not leave him now at his trial jaggers was proved right the judge decided that magwitch a convict sent away for life who had returned must be hanged i could not accept this terrible punishment and wrote to all the important people i could think of asking for mercy for magwitch but all of them refused to help i noticed on my daily visits to him that he was getting much worse he lay in bed looking calmly at the white ceiling sometimes he could not speak and just pressed my hand one evening as i entered his room he smiled weakly at me dear boy he said you re never late i don t want to lose a moment of the time i m allowed to visit you i said thank you dear boy god bless you you ve never de serted me dear boy he had spoken his last words i touched his chest remembering that i had wanted to desert him once he put both his hands on mine dear magwitch listen to me you had a child once who you loved and lost he pressed my hand gently she s alive she s a lady and very beautiful and i love her he was too weak to speak any more but he just managed to lift my hand to his lips then he looked peacefully up at the white ceiling again slowly his eyes closed and his head dropped quietly on to his chest a wedding the excitement of all these events made me seriously ill for several weeks herbert was abroad on business for clarrikers and there would have been nobody to look after me if joe bad not heard about my illness and come to london to nurse me when i was getting better he told me some of the local news miss havisham had died and left all her fortune to estella except for which matthew pocket inherited and orlick had been arrested for breaking into pumblechook s house and stealing his money dear old joe seemed just the same but as i got better he began to remember i was a gentleman and call me sir again and when i got up one morning i discovered he had gone i decided to go back to the village to thank him for all his help and to carry out a plan i had been considering for some time i wanted to ask biddy to marry me and i knew i would be happy with her so i went by coach to the old town as i had done so many times before and walked to the forge but as i came closer i could not hear the sound of joe s hammer and i noticed fresh white curtains at the windows and bright flowers everywhere suddenly i saw biddy and joe at the door arm in arm pip cried biddy happily running to kiss me pip it s my wedding day and i m married to joe i was still weak from my illness and the shock was too much for me they had to help me into the house and let me rest in a chair they were both so pleased that i had come by accident to make their day perfect i could only be glad that i had never spoken of my plan to joe when he was looking after me dear biddy i said you have the best husband in the whole world i couldn t love him more than i do she replied and dear joe you have the best wife in the world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be dear good joe joe put his arm over his eyes and joe and biddy i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you ve done for me tell me you forgive me for not being grateful and not being good and think better of me in the future oh dear old pip said joe god knows we forgive you if there is anything to forgive so i left the forge and started a new life working as a clerk for clarrikers herbert s company i was sent to the new office in india to take charge while herbert came back to england to marry his clara herbert and his wife invited me to live with them and we all stayed out in india for many years in the end i too became a partner in the company we worked hard and honestly and made good profits it was not until eleven years later that i returned to england and saw biddy and joe again although i had been writing regularly to them one evening in december i gently pushed open the old kitchen door and there sitting by the fire next to joe in my old place was pip joe and biddy s son had my name and looked just like me they also had a little daughter and were the happiest of parents dear pip said biddy quietly to me after supper have you quite forgotten her tell me as an old friend my dear biddy i can never forget her but that was all a dream which has passed but i was secretly planning to revisit miss havisham s old house alone as a way of remembering estella i had heard that her husband had been very cruel to her they had separated and then he had died two years ago perhaps she had remarried by now the old house had been knocked down and there was nothing left but piles of stones in the garden in the moonlight i walked sadly around until suddenly i saw a woman s figure in the shadows i went closer and then estella i cried you recognize me i have changed a lot she answered she was older but still beautiful i had never before seen such a soft light in those once proud eyes or felt such a friend ly touch of her once cold hand it s strange estella afer so many years we meet by chance here where we first met yes it s strange i haven t been here for years although the land belongs to me but tell me you still live abroad yes i still do i m doing well in india i ve often thought of you since my husband died i have given you a place in my heart you have always held your place in my heart i answered there was silence for a few moments i didn t think i would say goodbye to you here she said it s painful saying goodbye estella but last time you said god bless you god forgive you you could say that to me now now that i understand how much you loved me now that i have suffered now that i am a better person tell me we are friends she spoke more eagerly than i had ever heard her speak before we are friends i said taking her hand and will continue being friends even when we are apart said estella we walked hand in hand out of the old garden as the morning mist had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the evening mist was rising now and in the clear moonlight i saw no shadow of another separation from her txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com david copperfield s childhood i was born at blunderstone in suffolk in the east of england and was given my poor father s name david copperfield sadly he never saw me he was much older than my mother when they married and died six months before i was born my father s death made my beautiful young mother very unhappy and she knew she would find life extremely difficult with a new baby and no husband the richest and most important person in our family was my father s aunt miss betsey trotwood she had in fact been married once to a handsome young husband but because he demanded money from her and sometimes beat her she decided they should separate he went abroad and soon news came of his death miss trotwood bought a small house by the sea and lived there alone with only one servant she had not spoken to my father since his marriage because she considered he had made a mistake in marrying a very young girl but just before i was born when she heard that my mother was expecting a baby she came to visit blunderstone it was a cold windy friday afternoon in march my mother was sitting by the fire feeling very lonely and unhappy and crying a little suddenly a stern strange looking face appeared at the window open the door ordered the sternfaced lady my mother was shocked but obeyed at once you must be david copper field s wife said the lady as she entered i m betsey trotwood you ve heard of me yes whispered mother trembling how young you are cried miss betsey just a baby my mother started sobbing again i know i look like a child i know i was young to be a wife and i m young to be a mother but perhaps i ll die before i become a mother come come answered miss betsey have some tea then you ll feel better what do you call your girl my girl i don t know yet that it will be a girl replied my mother miserably no i don t mean the baby i mean your servant her name s peggotty her first name s clara the same as mine so i call her by her family name you see what a terrible name however never mind peggotty she called going to the door bring mrs copperfield some tea at once she sat down again and continued speaking you were talking about the baby i m sure it ll be a girl now as soon as she s born he perhaps said my mother bravely don t be stupid of course it ll be a she i m going to send her to school and educate her well i want to prevent her from making the mistakes i ve made in life miss betsey looked quite angry as she said this my mother said nothing as she was not feeling at all well but tell me were you and your husband happy asked miss betsey this made my poor mother feel worse than ever i know i wasn t very sensible about money or cooking or things like that she sobbed but we loved each other and he was helping me to learn and then he died oh oh and she fell back in her chair completely unconscious peggotty who came in just then with the tea realized how serious the situation was and took my mother upstairs to bed the doctor arrived soon afterwards and stayed all evening to take care of his patient at about midnight he came downstairs to the sitting room where miss betsey was waiting impatiently well doctor what s the news how is she the young mother is quite comfortable madam replied the doctor politely but she the baby how is she cried miss betsey the doctor looked strangely at miss betsey it s a boy madam he replied miss betsey said nothing but walked straight out of the house and never came back that was how i was born my early childhood was extremely happy as my beautiful mother and kind peggotty took care of me but when i was about eight a shadow passed over my happiness my mother often went out walking in her best clothes with a gentleman called mr murdstone he had black hair a big black moustache and an unpleasant smile and seemed to be very fond of my mother but i knew that peggotty did not like him a few months later peggotty told me that my mother was going to have a short holiday with some friends meanwhile peggotty and i would go to stay with her brother daniel in yarmouth on the east coast for two weeks i was very excited when we climbed into the cart although it was sad saying goodbye to my mother mr murdstone was at her shoulder waving goodbye as the driver called to his horse and we drove out of the village when we got down from the cart in yarmouth after our journey peggotty said that s the house master david i looked all round but could only see an old ship on the sand is that that your brother s house i asked in delight and when we reached it i saw it had doors and windows and a chimney just like a real house i could not imagine a nicer place to live everything was clean and tidy and smelt of fish now i was introduced to the peggotty family there was daniel peggotty a kind old sailor although he was not married he had adopted two orphans who lived with him and called him uncle ham peggotty was a large young man with a gentle smile and emily was a beautiful blue eyed little girl they all welcomed peggotty and me warmly i spent a wonderfully happy two weeks there playing all day on the beach with emily and sleeping in my own little bed on the ship i am sure i was in love with little emily in my childish way and i cried bitterly when we had to say goodbye at the end of the holiday but on the way home to blunderstone peggotty looked at me very worriedly master david my dear she said suddenly in a trembling voice i must tell you you ll have to know now while we ve been away your dear mother has married mr murdstone he s your stepfather now i was deeply shocked i could not understand how my mother could have married that man and when we arrived home i could not help showing my mother how very miserable i was i went straight to my room and lay sobbing on my bed which made my poor mother very unhappy too as she sat beside me holding my hand mr murdstone suddenly came in what s this chara my love he asked sternly remember you must be firm with the boy i ve told you before you re too weak with him oh yes edward i m afraid you re right my mother replied quickly i m very sorry i ll try to be firmer with him and when she left the room mr murdstone whispered angrily to me david do you know what i ll do if you don t obey me i ll beat you like a dog i was still very young and i was very frightened of him if he had said one kind word to me perhaps i would have liked and trusted him and my life would have been different instead i hated him for the influence he had over my dear mother who wanted to be kind to me but also wanted to please her new husband that evening mr murdstone s sister arrived to help my mother in the house a tall dark lady with a stern frowning face she looked and sounded very much like her brother i thought she was planning to stay with us for a long time and i was right in fact she intended to stay for ever she started work the next morning now clara she said firmly to my mother at breakfast i am here to help you you re much too pretty and thoughtless to worry about the servants the food and so on so just hand me your keys to all the cupboards and i ll take care of everything for you my poor mother just blushed looked a little ashamed and obeyed from then on miss murdstone took complete control of the house keeping the keys hanging from her waist as she hurried through the house checking that everything was being done just as she wished david is sent away to school i was very unhappy during this time mr murdstone insisted on my studying and so my mother gave me lessons in the past she and i had enjoyed our studies together and she had taught me a lot in her gentle way but now both mr and miss murdstone were present during my lessons and somehow i could not concentrate or remember what i had learnt my poor mother was very sympathetic and tried to encourage me sometimes even whispering the answer to me but the murdstones had sharp ears clara my love mr murdstone used to say crossly remember be firm you re making the boy s character worse by helping him like that oh edward i m sorry my mother replied looking embarrassed and hanging her head like a guilty child one morning when i arrived in the sittingroom as usual for my lesson i saw that mr murd stone had a thin stick in his hand i could not take my eyes off it you must be very careful today david he said with his unpleasant smile holding the stick in both hands i knew what would happen then a terrible fear took hold of me and all that i had learnt disappeared immediately from my memory so that i could not answer any of my mother s questions mr murdstone got up from his chair well david he said heavily i think you ve worried your mother enough today we ll go upstairs boy come and he picked up the stick i heard my mother crying as we went upstairs please mr murdstone i cried don t beat me i ve tried to learn really i have sir but he did not listen to me in my bedroom he held my arms and started hitting me with the stick i managed to get hold of his hand and bit deep into it he cried out angrily and began to hit me as hard as he could above the noise of my screams i could hear my mother and peggotty crying outside the door then the next moment he was gone i heard him lock the door and i was lying sore and bleeding on the floor the whole house seemed suddenly very quiet i stayed there for a time without moving in the evening miss murdstone brought me some bread and milk which she left on the floor beside me frowning angrily at me as she went out i was kept locked in that room for five days and nights and saw nobody except miss murdstone who brought me food but never spoke to me to a small boy the five days seemed like years and i can still remember how frightened and guilty i felt but during the fifth night i heard a strange noise at the key hole it was peggotty trying to give me a message master david my dear she whispered sobbing they are going to send you away to boarding school tomorrow oh peggotty i cried then i won t see you and mother very often no my love but don t forget i ll take care of your mother she needs her cross old peggotty i ll stay with her although i hate these murdstones and remember david i love you as much as i love your mother and more and i ll write to you thank you dear peggotty i whispered back tears rolling down my face will you write to your brother too and ham and little emily and tell them i m not as bad as the murdstones think and send my love to them especially little emily peggotty promised to do what i asked the next morning miss murdstone told me that because of my wickedness i was going away to school she had already packed my case for me my mother was only allowed to say a very quick goodbye to me when the horse and cart arrived the driver put my case on the cart and we drove slowly out of blunderstone i was still sobbing loudly when suddenly i saw peggotty running after us on the road the driver stopped and waited for her with difficulty she climbed up onto the cart here master david she cried breathlessly a little present from me and your dear mother take care of yourself my dear she put a small purse and a paper bag into my hands and held me so close to her fat body that i thought i would never breathe again then she jumped down and ran back along the road to the village as we continued our journey i dried my tears and looked at what she had given me the bag was full of peggotty s special cakes and in the purse were eight bright shilling coins thinking of my mother and peggotty made me start crying again but just then the driver mr barkis began to talk to me he was a large red faced man who clearly found conversation difficult did she make those cakes he asked slowly having finished the one that i had offered him you mean peggotty sir yes she does all our cooking does she replied mr barkis with great interest there was a long silence while he considered his next question does she have a young man he asked you know someone who wants to marry her peggotty a young man i repeated surprised oh no she s never had any young men ah replied mr barkis looking very pleased again he thought for a long time before speaking well he said at last perhaps if you write to her will you be writing to her you could give her a message from me you could say barkis is willing would you do that barkis is willing i repeated innocently wondering what the message meant yes of course but you could tell her yourself mr barkis when you return to blunderstone tomorrow no no he said no you just give her the message remember barkis is willing after this conversation mr barkis was completely silent for the rest of the journey when we arrived in yarmouth i bought paper at the hotel and wrote this letter to peggotty my dear peggotty i have arrived safely in yarmouth barkis is willing please give my love to mother yours david p s he says it s important barkis is willing in yarmouth i was put on the long distance coach to london and travelled all through the night at the coach station in london i was collected by a teacher mr mell and taken to salem house the school which the murdstones had chosen for me the school was a large old building with a dusty playground surrounded by a high brick wall it looked strangely deserted i was very surprised to find that none of the boys were there and was told that they were all on holiday and that i had been sent there during the holidays as a punishment for my wickedness the headmaster and teachers were on holiday too all except for mr mell who had to look after me i spent a whole month in that miserable place doing my lessons in the dirty empty classroom which smelt of old food and unwashed boys every evening i had to eat my supper with mr mell and then go straight to bed the worst thing was the sign i had to wear round my neck it said be careful he bites i was only allowed to take it off when i went to bed although i was extremely lonely and unhappy at this time i was not looking forward to meeting all the other boys i felt sure they would laugh at me and especially at the sign i was forced to wear but one day mr mell told me that the headmaster mr creakle had returned and wanted to see me so i went trembling to his part of the house i realized at once that mr creakle lived much more comfortably than the boys or the teachers he was a small fat man with a purple nose who was sitting in an armchair with a bottle and a glass in front of him so this is the boy who bites is it he asked unpleasantly i know your stepfather boy he s a man of strong character he is he knows me and i know him do you know me answer me boy he pulled violently at my ear not yet sir i answered tears of pain in my eyes ah but you soon will oh yes i have a strong character too you ll see he banged his hand hard on the table i was very frightened but i made myself ask the question i had been considering for a whole month please sir i m very sorry for what i did to mr murdstone could could i take this sign off before the other boys see it mr creakle gave a sudden terrible shout and jumped out of his chair i did not wait to see whether he was going to hit me but ran out of his room and hid in my bed for the next hour however the boys were not as cruel to me as i had feared i made a friend almost immediately a boy called tommy traddles who was known to be the unluckiest boy in the school i was also noticed and even smiled on by the great james steerforth one of the oldest boys at least six years older than me he was a handsome intelligent curly haired young man who had become an important figure at the school with great influence over the younger boys how much money have you got copperfield he asked me eight shillings steerforth i answered remembering the present my mother and peggotty had given me you d better give it to me i ll take care of it for you he offered in a friendly way i opened peggotty s purse and turned it upside down into his hand perhaps you d like to spend some of it now he suggested smiling a bottle of wine a tin of biscuits a few cakes that sort of thing i can go out whenever i like so i can buy it for you ye es that s very kind of you i said although i was a little worried that all my money would disappear when we went upstairs to bed i realized that all my money had been spent as eight shillings worth of food and drink was laid out on my bed in the moonlight of course i did not want to eat and drink it all by myself so i invited steerforth and the others to help themselves the boys were very willing and we spent a pleasant evening sitting on our beds whispering to each other i discovered that the boys all hated salem house which they considered one of the worst schools in the country they especially hated mr creakle who was in the habit of beating them regularly with a heavy stick which he carried with him at all times the only boy he dared not beat was steerforth i admired steerforth even more when i heard this when we were all too tired to stay awake steerforth got up to go goodnight young copperfield he said putting a hand on my head i ll take care of you it s very kind of you i replied gratefully you haven t got a sister have you he asked sleepily no i haven t i answered what a pity if you had one i m sure she d be a pretty bright eyed little girl i would have liked to meet her i thought of him a lot that night with his laughing hand some face and his careless confident manner i could never have imagined what a dark shadow he would throw over the lives of people who were dear to me i stayed at salem house for three more months although one or two of the teachers like mr mell were kind to us boys and tried to teach us properly we were too afraid of mr creakle and his stick to concentrate on our studies but tom my traddles and i cheered each other up if we were beaten and i was lucky enough to be friendly with the great steerforth in spite of the difference in our ages however my home even with the murdstones there seemed a much pleasanter place than school and i was glad when the christmas holidays arrived and i was allowed to return to blunderstone i was a little surprised to find that my mother had a new baby and i could see at once that she was not well she looked tired and worried and very thin but she and peggotty were delighted to see me although they dared not show it if the murdstones were present my stepfather and his sister seemed to hate me even more than before if that were possible and they made my life quite miserable whenever they could in fact i was almost pleased when it was time to return to school and see traddles and steerforth again as the cart drove away i remember my mother standing outside our house with her baby in her arms smiling sadly at me that was the last time i saw her and that is how i shall always remember her david the orphan life went on as normal for me at school until my birthday two months later in march i remember that day very well it was cold icy weather and we boys had to blow on our fingers and rub our hands to keep warm in the freezing classrooms when a message came for me to go and see mr creakle i thought that peggotty must have sent me a birthday present and so i hurried gladly along to his room but there i realized something unusual had happened because it was mr creakle s wife who was waiting to speak to me david my child she said kindly holding my hand we all have to accept that our loved ones can die at any moment i looked at her trying to understand what she meant i m sorry to tell you she continued that your mother is dangerously ill there was a mist in front of my eyes and suddenly burning tears ran down my face i knew the truth your mother is dead she said i was already sobbing loudly and i felt i was an orphan quite alone in the world mrs creakle packed my case herself and sent me home on the coach for the funeral i did not realize at the time that i would never return to salem house when i arrived home peggotty met me at the door and we cried miserably in each other s arms mr murdstone seemed very sad and did not speak to me at all miss murdstone however showed her usual firmness of character which she and her brother were so proud of by checking that i had brought all my clothes back from school after that she showed no interest in me at all there was a deathly stillness in the house peggotty took me up to the room where my dear mother s dead body lay with my little brother who had died a few hours after her everything was fresh and clean in the room but i could not look at my mother s lovely face which would never smile at me again without crying how did it happen peggotty i asked sobbing she was ill for a long time master david she got worse after the baby was born you see she was sometimes unhappy and forgetful but she was always the same to me her old peggotty those two downstairs often spoke crossly to her and made her sad but she still loved them you know she was so sweet and loving i always sat beside her while she went to sleep it made her feel better she said there was a short silence while peggotty dried her eyes then took both my hands in hers on the last night she asked me for some water and then gave me such a patient smile she looked so beautiful the sun was beginning to rise and she put her head on my arm on her stupid cross old peggotty s arm and died like an innocent child going to sleep after my mother s funeral i began to wonder what would happen to me the murdstones did not even seem to notice that i was in the house they had told peggotty to leave as they did not what her as their servant any more so peggotty was going to her brother s in yarmouth until she decided what work to do next she suggested taking me with her for a holiday and to my surprise the murdstones agreed so next morning mr barkis appeared at the door with his cart and peggotty s cases were put on it we climbed up and sat beside him peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home where she had been so happy with my mother and me and at first she cried a little but when mr barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful he too began to look happier and he whispered to me barkis is willing you told her that aloud he said to peggotty are you comfortable peggotty laughed and said that she was and are you comfortable master david be asked i said that i was mr barkis was so pleased with this conversation that he repeated it many times during the journey and peggotty and i both had to keep giving him the same answer when we arrived in yarmouth and got down from the cart we said goodbye to mr barkis daniel and ham peggotty were waiting for us daniel and ham were exactly the same as i remembered them cheerful and generous as ever but little emily seemed different somehow she was taller and prettier but she did not want to play with me or spend her time with me i was rather disappointed because i still considered she was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen and i thought i was in love with her daniel and ham were very proud of her intelligence and beauty and just smiled when she laughingly refused to sit next to me but they all listened with interest to my stories of school life at salem house i told them about the other boys especially the handsome clever steerforth i admired him so much that i could not stop myself telling them all about him suddenly i noticed that emily was listening eagerly her blue eyes shining and a smile on her lips she blushed when she saw that we were all looking at her and hid her face behind her hands emily s like me said peggotty kindly and would like to see david s friend mr steerforth the days passed happily although emily and i did not play together as we had done before mr barkis was a frequent visitor and soon peggotty explained to me that she had decided to marry him i ll love you just as much david my dear when i m married she told me holding me close to her and i ll be able to come and see you in the cart any time i like barkis is a good man and i m sure i ll be happy with him he s got a nice little house and i ll keep a little bedroom there for you to use whenever you want you ll always be welcome to come and stay so when i returned to blunderstone peggotty had become mrs barkis and i was glad to think of her in her own house with a husband to take care of her at home my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me as they considered school too expensive they finally arranged for me to start work although i was still only ten years old and very small for my age i was sent to london to work in a warehouse in the east of the city near the river my job was to wash bottles which would then be filled with wine or to pack the filled bottles in cases i was paid only six shillings a week there were several other boys who worked with me but i was the only one who had been to school all the warehouse workers were coarse rough people who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours no words can describe the horror i felt when i realized what my life was going to be like from now on i was deeply ashamed at having such a job and i was also afraid that i would forget everything i had learnt from my mother and my teachers i would never find friends like traddles or steerforth or be able to get a better position in life it was an extremely unhappy time for me my stepfather had asked mr quinion the manager to find me somewhere to stay in london so at the end of my first day i was called to mr quinion s office and introduced to an important looking rather fat middle aged man with a head as bald as an egg his name was mr micawber and he offered me a spare room in the house he was renting with his family i agreed to take it and mr micawber and i walked home together the micawbers were obviously very poor but tried hard not to let this show the house had several floors of rather dirty empty rooms with very little furniture mrs micawber was a thin tired looking woman with a baby in her arms the baby was one of twins and in all my experience of the family i never saw mrs micawber without at least one of the twins they also had a four year old son and a three year old daughter their only servant was a young orphan girl i never thought mrs micawber told me sadly as she showed me my room when i lived with mother and father before i was married that i would ever be as poor as this but as mr micawber is for the moment in difficulties i must of course accept the situation i m afraid he owes a lot of money but his creditors will just have to wait you can t get blood out of a stone nor can anyone get any money at all out of mr micawber at present i soon realized that neither mr nor mrs micawger had ever been able to manage money the little that mr micawber earned was not enough either to keep his creditors happy or to pay for the needs of his growing family so his creditors were constantly at the door demanding payment and meals were rather irregular in the micawber house mr and mrs micawber s moods varied according to the situation one moment mr micawber looked extremely miserable and depressed the next he was brushing his shoes and singing a song before going out mrs micawber s character was similar to her hus band s sometimes i came home to find her lying on the floor with her hair undone looking wild and desperate but an hour later she was cheerfully eating a good supper i lived with these kind people for several months and became very fond of them i bought my own food out of my wages because i knew the micawbers hardly ever had enough for themselves and i lived mostly on bread and cheese as they were so short of money once or twice i offered to lend them a few shillings which they refused to accept but at last mr micawber s creditors became tired of waiting for their money and went to the police who arrested him for debt he was taken to the king s prison and asked me to visit him there when i arrived i was shown to his room where he was waiting for me he seemed quite brokenhearted and even cried a little this is a black day for me copperfield he sobbed i hope my mistakes will be a warning to young people like you remember if a man earns twenty pounds a year and spends nineteen pounds and nineteen shillings the result is happiness but if he spends twenty pounds and one shilling the result is misery by the way copperfield could you lend me a shilling for some beer mrs micawber will pay you back as soon as you arrive home and when the beer arrived he appeared much more cheerful we had a pleasant evening telling stories and jokes he stayed in prison for several weeks and i visited him regularly i was delighted to hear on one of my visits that he would soon be free as his creditors had unwillingly accepted the fact that he had no way of paying his debts i gave the news to mrs micawber when i returned home we celebrated by sharing our supper and a glass of wine together may i ask what you will do madam when mr micawber is free i asked politely my family said mrs micawber grandly believe that mr micawber should move to the country to devon and carry on his business interests there mr micawber is a very clever man master copperfield i m sure he is i agreed although they haven t found anything exactly right for him yet my family think he should be ready in devon in case something turns up she put down her empty glass and will you be going with him madam i asked i must i will mrs micawber s voice rose to a scream he is my life my love my husband the father of my children i will never desert mr micawber you can t ask me to desert him i felt very uncomfortable as i had not asked her to desert him at all but she soon became calm again and finished her supper i was becoming used to the micawbers changes of mood i now realized that when the micawbers left london as they were planning to do i would be very lonely in the city i still hated my work in the warehouse and wanted to make a better life for myself i thought about it for a long time and decided there was only one thing i could do i would try to find my one surviving relation my father s aunt miss betsey trotwood and ask her to help me i knew she lived somewhere near dover in kent i could go there by coach be cause peggotty had once sent me ten shillings to keep in case i ever needed it the time had come to use that money david and his aunt so after helping the micawbers to pack their few clothes and waving goodbye to them at the coach sta tion on their way to devon i went to the warehouse for my last day at work i did not tell anyone i would not be coming back the following week in the evening i packed my case and put the ten shillings in the little purse peggotty had once given me i looked around for someone to help me with my case which was rather heavy for me and saw a tall young man with a horse and cart passing by could you please take my case to the coach station i asked him politely the young man put the case into his cart then looking round quickly to make sure there were no witnesses he pushed me roughly against the wall and took my purse out of my trembling hand before i could say a word he had driven the horse and cart down the road and out of sight round the corner i knew i would never see him my case or my ten shillings again i sat down on the pavement and cried now i had lost ev erything i owned in the world and had no money for the coach fare to dover in the end i decided i would have to walk there and i started the long journey it took me six days to cover the hundred kilometres as i got tired very easily and had to rest i sold my jacket for a shilling so that i could buy bread and milk on the way and at night i slept in disused farm buildings or under trees sometimes i was afraid of the dangerous looking beggars and thieves i met on the road but i knew i had to keep going as i walked i thought of my mother s gentle pretty face i felt sure she would approve of what i was doing and that encouraged me to continue but when i arrived in dover it seemed a much larger town than i had imagined i spent a whole morning asking people if they knew where miss betsey trotwood lived finally i found someone who recognized the name and showed me the way to her house i stood at her front door in the neat little garden for a few moments trembling with fear and wondering what my aunt would think of me my face and hands were dirty my hair was unbrushed and my clothes were torn and dusty perhaps she wouldn t even want to invite me into her house just then a handsome but strict looking grey haired woman came out of the door towards me i knew she must be my aunt go away she said crossly i don t allow anyone to walk on my grass please madam i said bravely please aunt what cried miss betsey in great surprise please aunt i m your nephew good heavens she cried and sat down rather suddenly on the grass i m david copper field your nephew s son of blunder stone in suffolk where you came on the night i was born and saw my dear mother i ve been very unhappy since she died my stepfather sent me to work in london and i hated it and ran away and someone stole my case and my money and i ve had to walk all the way and i haven t slept in a bed for six nights here my selfcontrol broke and i fell to the ground sobbing bitterly my aunt jumped to her feet picked me up and took me into her sitting room where she mixed some medicine in a glass and made me drink it she also wrapped me in a large blanket and put me on her sofa then she rang the bell for her servant janet please ask mr dick to come here janet she said a tall grey haired pleasant looking gentleman entered a few minutes later laughing rather strangely to himself now mr dick said my aunt firmly don t be a fool because we all know you re intelligent mr dick looked very serious at once no doubt you remember that i had a nephew david copperfield well this is his son he has run away oh really david s son run away well said mr dick now the question is mr dick what shall i do with him well mr dick looked vacantly at me and then sudden ly his eyes shone if i were you i would wash him well done mr dick you always have the right answer said my aunt delightedly and so they washed me and gave me clean clothes and deli cious food while i was eating my aunt stared at me occa sionally whispering good heavens to herself when she could see that i felt better she asked me question after ques tion and i told her the story of my life good heavens she said again when i had finished why did your poor mother marry again what a terrible mis take perhaps she was in love suggested mr dick smiling his rather foolish smile in love said miss betsey crossly perhaps the poor silly girl thought she was in love but now mr dick another question what should we do with the boy well said mr dick thinking then an idea suddenly came to him you should put him to bed thank you again mr dick for your common sense said my aunt happily janet put the boy to bed and so in a comfortable clean little bed in a pleasant airy room at the top of miss betsey trotwood s house i floated away into the world of my dreams at breakfast next morning i bravely asked my aunt are you have you what s going to happen to me i ve written to your stepfather she replied oh are you going to send me back to the murdstones please don t aunt please let me stay here i cried trembling i don t know what i ll do yet we ll have to wait and see she answered firmly this news made me very depressed but there was nothing i could do about it and my aunt soon began to talk about some thing else what do you think of mr dick child he looks a little well mad is he mad aunt well his family called him mad and wanted to lock him up for ever but i met him and thought i still think he s an extremely sensible intelligent person so i offered to take care of him and he s lived in my house for ten years nobody knows what useful advice he s given me i trust him com pletely when i heard how generous my aunt had been to poor harmless mr dick i began to understand her character better in spite of her stern appearance and frequent crossness she was very kind to people who needed her help i hoped she would be kind to me several days later i was looking out of the sitting room window when i saw mr and miss murdstone riding into my aunt s garden my aunt had seen them too and hurried out waving her umbrella angrily at them and shouting go away don t ride on my grass who do you think you are go away i tell you aunt i cried out they re mr and miss murdstone i don t care she shouted nobody is allowed to ride on my grass and she went back into her house banging the door behind her the murdstones had to lead their horses out of the garden and then return to ring the doorbell they looked very uncomfortable and unsure of themselves janet showed them into the sitting room where my aunt mr dick and i were waiting miss trotwood began mr murdstone stepping forward excuse me said my aunt sharply i imagine you are the mr murdstone who married my nephew s widow in my opinion it would have been much better if you had never mar ried the poor child i agree with you miss trotwood said miss murdstone smiling falsely my brother would certainly have been happi er if he hadn t married her because i consider poor dear clara was in fact just a child fortunately said my aunt you and i madam are too old and plain for anyone to say that about us miss murdstone did not seem eager to agree to this her brother however wanted to get down to business miss trotwood he said a little crossly having received your letter i ve come to explain to you in case you haven t realized it yet that this boy is extremely wicked and violent both my sister and i have tried to change his character but sadly we have failed i must add said miss murdstone that of all the boys in the world i believe this is the worst boy i see said my aunt now tell me has david inherited any money from his father or mother no madam answered mr murdstone my dear clara naturally trusted me to take care of david and i m ready to do that if he comes back with me now but i alone shall de cide what to do with him miss trotwood understand that i am here for the first and last time to take him away if you decide to keep him with you you keep him for ever what do you say david asked my aunt turning to me please don t let me go with them aunt i begged they ve always been unkind to me and they made my mother very unhappy i ll be so miserable if i have to go back with them what do you think mr dick asked my aunt mr dick thought for a moment get a suit of clothes made for him immediately he said what would i do without you mr dick asked my aunt shaking his hand enthusiastically then she turned to mr murdstone you d better go i ll keep the boy and take my chance with him i don t believe a word of your story do you think i don t know how you broke that poor girl s heart and how you hated her son and punished him for it i can see by your face that i m right we all stared at mr murdstone it was true that his face was white and he was breathing fast good bye sir and goodbye to you too madam added my aunt turning suddenly to miss murdstone if i see you riding on my grass again i ll knock your hat right off your head the murdstones said nothing in reply to these fierce words but walked quickly out of the house thank you thank you aunt i cried i ll do my best to make you proud of me and i kissed her many times mr dick you and i will adopt this boy together said my aunt her stern expression softening into a smile and so a new life began for me i was soon able to forget the warehouse and the murdstones in learning to please my aunt and to play games with mr dick who spent much of his time with me but one day my aunt suggested that i should go to boarding school in canterbury i was delighted as i was eager to con tinue my studies and canterbury was very near my aunt s home in dover so the next day my aunt and i went to can terbury where i admired the beautiful old buildings in the an cient city centre is it a large school aunt i asked politely i haven t decided which school you ll go to yet she replied first we re going to ask my old friend mr wickfield s advice about it he lives and works in canterbury you see soon we stopped in front of a very old house with a very clean front doorstep and fresh white curtains at the windows a strange looking person dressed in black with short red hair and a very thin white face came out to meet us i thought he must be a servant he was about fifteen but looked much older is mr wickfield at home uriah heep asked my aunt he is madam replied uriah smiling unpleasantly he showed us into the sitting room where i noticed two large paintings on the wall one of a grey haired gentleman and the other of a lady with a sweet gentle face just then a gentle man entered the room looking a little older than his picture i soon discovered he was mr wickfield my aunt s lawyer mr wickfield said my aunt this is my nephew i have adopted him and i want to send him to a good boarding school here in canterbury can you help me find a school for him mr wickfield thought for a moment there s a very good school i can recommend dr strong s but the boy can t board there and it s too far to travel from dover every day however he could live here if you liked in my house there s plenty of room for him that s very kind of you mr wickfield i ll pay you for his food of course said my aunt come and meet agnes who takes care of everything and manages the house said mr wickfield we all went upstairs to another sitting room prettily furnished where a girl of my own age was sitting on her face i saw immediately the beau tiful calm expression of the lady in the painting downstairs and i knew she must be mr wickfield s daughter agnes when i saw the way mr wickfield looked at agnes and held her hand i realized that she was the only thing that made life worth living for him the lady in the painting was her mother who had died some years before and agnes was now in complete charge of the house she welcomed me warmly as a guest and showed me the comfortable bedroom i would sleep in my aunt was very happy to leave me in the care of mr wickfield and his daughter i must leave now david she told me mr wickfield will take you to school tomorrow and make all the arrange ments i m sure you will work hard and do well thank you aunt i said trying not to cry and give my love to mr dick and thank you again when she had gone i dried my tears and spent a pleasant evening with the wickfields we ate supper and talked in the pretty little sitting room agnes played the piano and tried to amuse her father but he often looked serious and rather sad during the evening he drank a good deal of wine i wondered why he seemed unhappy the next day i had my first experience of a well organized school it could not have been more different from salem house the headmaster dr strong was a gentle kind man who enjoyed teaching and never punished anybody i soon made friends with the other boys and as time went on with the teachers too but although i liked school very much i was always happy to return to the wickfields quiet house every evening there agnes used to help me with my studies and listen sympathetically to my problems and her father always seemed pleased to see me i often wrote to my aunt and peg gotty and mr dick came to visit me once a week the strangest person in my new life was uriah heep soon after i arrived in canterbury we had a conversation one evening he was doing a lot of mr wickfield s work and was working late in his small office just off the hall of the wick fields house come in come in master copperfield he cried when he saw me passing the door i entered and found him reading a large dusty book and making careful notes in a notebook what are you studying uriah i asked politely i m going to be a lawyer he replied rubbing his thin hands together and smiling his oily smile you re mr wickfield s assistant aren t you perhaps one day you ll be his partner i said trying to make conversation oh no master copperfield cried uriah rolling his eyes upwards i could never rise so high no i m much too humble for that but thank you master copperfield for thinking kindly of me and may i say that if ever you have the time and i m sure a young gentleman like you is much too busy to spare the time for a poor person like me my mother and i would be glad to offer you a cup of tea at our humble home of course if i have time i answered and left the room quickly i did not feel comfortable with him for some reason but the following week he invited me to tea again and i did not want to appear rude so i agreed that evening he and i walked to the small house where he lived with his mother it was a warm day and we were drinking our tea near the open door when a gentleman i recognized passed by it was mr mi cawber he saw me sitting near the door and called out cop perfield is it really you i was delighted to see him again and mrs heep invited him in for some tea i had to introduce him to the heeps but i did not think that uriah would be a good influence on mr micaw ber however i was interested to discover that the micawbers were now living in canterbury as nothing had turned up in devon they seemed to be very short of money again and surrounded by creditors as usual i left the heeps house as soon as possible taking mr micawber with me as i did not want him to tell uriah all about my life at the warehouse in london and so the years passed i learnt everything that dr strong and his teachers could teach me and at seventeen came to the end of my schooldays my aunt suggested that before decid ing what profession to choose i should spend a month in lon don or travelling round the country this would give me time to consider my next step i agreed enthusiastically and al though i was sorry to say goodbye to my sweet friend agnes and her father i was looking forward to leading the life of an independent young gentleman david meets old friends again i decided to go to london first to stay at a hotel for a few nights and see all the sights of that great city i knew it would be very different from the last time i was in london when i was working at the warehouse now i was adult and educated and had money the hotel i chose was called the golden cross and because i looked so young i was given a very small dark room in the roof but i did not feel confident enough to complain that evening i was returning from the theatre when i recognized someone going into the hotel i could not prevent my self from saying at once steerforth do you remember me he stared at me for a moment then he cried good heavens it s little copperfield i was so delighted to see him that i held both his hands saying my dear steerforth you have no idea how pleased i am to see you again i remembered how much i had admired him and all my love for him came back i had to brush away the tears from my eyes don t cry copperfield old boy he said kindly i m glad to see you too what are you doing here i ve just finished school and my aunt has sent me to lon don to look around before deciding on a profession what about you steerforth well i m studying at oxford university but nothing ex citing ever happens there that s why i m in london for a few days but it s boring here too isn t it in london i asked surprised i think it s wonderful there s so much to do and see i ve just been to the theatre the actors were excellent and david david laughed steerforth it does me good to see your fresh innocent face so full of excitement now let me see which room are staying in number it s rather high up i confessed blushing they ve put you in number i ll soon change that and when steerforth complained to the manager i was imme diately given a large airy comfortable room on the first floor next to his that night as i fell asleep i thought happily of the next few days which steerforth and i were planning to spend together a week passed very quickly with visits to the theatre the museums and the zoo we went sightseeing riding swimming and boating steerforth was the perfect companion to have and i admired him even more than before in fact i loved him with all my heart one day i said to him you know steerforth i really must go and visit my mother s old servant peggotty she was very good to me when i was a child yes david i remember you told me she lives in yarmouth now doesn t she why don t we go there together oh yes steerforth you d enjoy meeting her brothef and all the family they re very kind good people even if they are only working people said steerforth i looked quickly at him to see what he meant but he was smiling at me so i knew he was joking and i smiled too we travelled to yarmouth by coach and when we arrived steerforth stayed at the hotel while i went to barkis s house to find peggotty when i knocked at the door peggotty opened it and did not recognize me for a moment i had continued to write to her regularly but we had not seen each other for seven years and i was no longer the small boy she remembered but when she realized i was her master david she sobbed and sobbed with delight holding me in her arms as she had always done soon she was calmer and we talked about the events of the last few years i heard that she was very happy with mr barkis who however was ill in bed at the time she was so pleased to see me that she insisted i should sleep at her house during my stay in yarmouth in the little bedroom she had al ways kept for me the next day i took steerforth with me to visit daniel peg gotty it was a dark and windy winter evening as we came closer to the old boat we heard happy voices and laughter in side i opened the door and suddenly i was surrounded by daniel ham and emily all looking very surprised look it s master david look how he s grown and for a moment we were all shaking hands and talking and laughing at the same time i did not forget to introduce steerforth they welcomed him warmly as my best friend well cried daniel peggotty his large face red and shin ing with delight it s wonderful master david that you two gentlemen have come here tonight of all nights the best night of my life because tonight gentlemen my little emily and he took emily s small white hand in his rough red one and placed it on his heart has agreed to become ham s wife i congratulate you with all my heart said steerforth politely to ham without taking his eyes off emily who was blushing prettily master david knows how i love this girl continued old daniel and my dearest wish was for her to have a good husband to take care of her and there s no one i trust more than ham he s only a rough sailor like me but he s honest and sincere and i know she ll come to no harm while he lives meanwhile ham was blushing too i did not know what to say unsure whether i still loved emily and was therefore jealous of ham or whether i was glad they were going to be happy together but steerforth always knew the right thing to say and with a few well chosen words he made us all feel much more comfortable we spent the rest of the evening very pleasantly telling stories and singing songs and it was midnight when steerforth and i left the old boat well said steerforth to me as we walked across the sand in the cold night air what a lovely girl and what a coarse young man she s engaged to i was shocked by these unexpectedly cold words but when i turned to him and saw him smiling i replied warmly ah steerforth you pretend to laugh at people who are poorer or less educated than yourself but i ve just seen you spend the whole evening with the peggotty family making them happy i know you understand and love them and i admire you all the more for it he stopped and looked at me saying rather sadly david you re serious aren t you i wish i were as good as you for the next two weeks i was often with peggotty and barkis while steerforth went sailing or fishing with daniel and ham or found other things to do so i did not see very much of him finally we decided to return to london while we were travelling back on the coach i turned to say something and was surprised to see how miserable he looked oh david he said unhappily i wish i could control myself better i hate myself sometimes steerforth what can you mean i cried you re the best the most intelligent the kindest of men thank you david he said shaking his head but you don t know how bad i am bad i repeated my dear steerforth don t say that i know your character well and i m proud to call you my friend in a little while his mood changed and he became cheerful again i soon forgot his words but i remembered them later in london i discovered that my aunt had arrived at the colden cross hotel and had booked a room there for several days we were delighted to see each other and had a long conversation that evening she had come to ask me a particular question david she said very seriously i ve been thinking about your future profession how would you feel about becoming a lawyer i thought for a moment well aunt it sounds a very good idea i confess i hadn t considered it before but i think i d like it very good said my aunt jumping up in that case let s go immediately to see mr spenlow he s a partner in an important law firm and i think he ll agree to train you we ll have to pay him of course but after several years you ll be a properly trained lawyer and be able to earn your own money and so we carried out this plan my aunt paid mr spenlow s firm a thousand pounds and i promised to work hard and do my best to become a successful lawyer before she returned to dover my aunt rented a small flat for me at the top of a house near the lawcourts and i moved in at once at first it seemed very exciting to walk through the busy streets after a long day in the courts or at mr spenlow s dusty office and know that i had my own home to return to but when i had climbed up all the stairs and entered my sitting room it no longer seemed so exciting in fact my flat looked empty and depressing so after two days of loneliness i was very glad to receive my first visitor steerforth and because i was so happy to see him i invited him and two friends of his to dinner the next evening as it was my first dinner party i did not know what to buy but i ordered cooked dishes of chicken and fish from the restaurant bought cheese and fruit from the market and had a large number of bottles of wine delivered i was quite fright ened by how much money i had spent but when steerforth and his friends arrived i soon became more cheerful the party was a great success and we all enjoyed ourselves very much we ate and drank and smoked and drank again i was constantly opening bottles of wine and became unusually talkative i began to feel rather strange and when i caught sight of myself in a mirror i seemed very pale i had to confess to myself that i looked drunk someone suggested going to the theatre and in a kind of mist we left my flat and walked through the streets steerforth was holding my arm and laughing then a man in a little box looked out of the fog and took money from somebody soon we were sitting high up in a very hot very crowded theatre there were bright lights and there was music but i could not understand what anyone was saying and the whole building seemed to swim in front of my eyes then someone suggested going to visit some friends in an other part of the theatre so we went downstairs suddenly i saw quite clearly agnes wickfield sitting with a lady and gentleman she was looking at me with a surprised expression on her face good heavens i cried agnes you re in london quiet she whispered people are trying to listen to the actors you ll disturb them then she added kindly david please do what i say ask your friends to take you home i had always taken agnes s advice and i did so this time i do not remember how i got home but i do remember steer forth helping me to undress and get into bed what a terrible sleepless night i spent how ill i felt how dry my mouth was but the next morning i felt even worse i was so miser able and ashamed that i had been so stupid and that agnes had seen me drunk i could not even apologize to her because i did not know where she was staying in london i spent the whole day with my head in my hands in my dirty smoky room surrounded by empty wine bottles but the next day a note was delivered to my flat it was from agnes asking me to visit her at the house where she was staying i went straight there after my day s work at the office she looked so quiet and good and reminded me so much of my happy schooldays in canterbury that i could not help crying i m so sorry agnes i said that you saw me like that i wish i were dead david don t be unhappy she said cheerfully you know you can trust me and i ll always be your friend i took her hand and kissed it agnes you re my good angel she shook her head no david but if i were i d warn you to stay away from your bad angel my dear agnes i cried do you mean steerforth i do david she replied looking firmly at me agnes you re wrong he is my trusted friend he helps and guides me it wasn t his fault that i got drunk you know i wasn t thinking of that i judge him from what you ve told me about him and your character and his influence over you agnes spoke very seriously and her words went straight to my heart i m certain i m right you ve made a dangerous friend david because you re so trusting please remember what i say and forgive me for saying it i will if you forgive me for getting drunk agnes agreed smiling and then said suddenly have you seen uriah heep no i replied is he in london what s he doing here i m worried david answered agnes with sadness in her beautiful eyes i think he s going to be father s partner i remembered uriah heep s oily smile and how uncomfort able he always used to make me feel what that creature he s so unpleasant you must pre vent your father from agreeing to it agnes agnes smiled miserably my poor father has no choice you know how unhappy he has often been and of course you ve seen him drinking you see he loved my mother very much and when she died he didn t care so much about his work that s when he started drinking uriah s very clever he knows all this and he s been very useful to father doing all the work that father had forgotten or didn t want to do father really needs uriah now to keep his business going and uriah himself pretends to be humble and grateful but in fact he s in a strong position and is insisting on becoming a partner father is ashamed of himself but he has to agree poor father i d do anything to help him any thing and agnes sobbed bitterly i had never seen agnes cry before it made me so sad that i could only say helplessly my dear agnes please don t cry however in a few minutes she was calm again and i was able to leave her promising to visit her and her father in canter bury very soon david falls in love a gnes had asked me to be polite to uriah if i met him and so when i saw him the next day near the law courts i was careful not to offend him he looked even stranger than before with his small evil head and long thin body and his wide oily smile when we shook hands i no ticed how cold and wet his hand felt just like a fish would you would you like to come to my rooms for coffee uriah i offered trying to hide my horror of him oh master copperfield i mean mister copperfield i should say now how kind of you i m too humble to expect such kindness but i would like that and when we reached my flat he looked at me with an unpleasantly confident smile and said perhaps you ve heard that i m going to become mr wickfield s partner mr cop perfield yes i replied agnes has told me about it ah i m glad to hear that miss agnes knows about it he answered thank you for that mr copperfield i was annoyed with myself for mentioning agnes s name and hated hearing him say it but i said nothing and drank my coffee you said once mr copperfield continued uriah rubbing his hands together happily that perhaps i d be mr wickfield s partner one day it was kind of you to say so a humble person like me remembers things like that and now it s true i m glad to think i ve been able to help poor mr wickfield oh how very careless he has been if i hadn t been his assistant he would certainly have lost his business his house and all his money by now of course i m helping him because i admire him and not only him suddenly although the room was warm an icy coldness spread through my body as i stared into his cruel little face miss agnes is looking beautiful at the moment isn t she he went on smiling horribly mr copperfield i trust you because as you know i ve always liked you although i m so humble and you re a gentleman so i d like to tell you my little secret in spite of my low position i love miss agnes i ve given my heart to her and i hope to marry her one day there was a purple mist in front of my eyes i wanted to hit his ugly face or stab a knife right into his wicked heart i was almost mad with anger but i thought of agnes s request and i managed to control myself have have you spoken to agnes about your your love i asked as calmly as i could oh no mr copperfield i m waiting for the right moment perhaps i ll ask her when i become her father s partner she ll think kindly of me you see when she realizes how much her father needs me she loves him so much ah what a good daughter my agnes is and what an excellent wife she ll be to me dear sweet agnes my adopted sister i did not know any man good enough to be her husband could she ever marry this worthless insect when uriah left my flat i spent a sleepless night worrying about what i should do in the end i decided to say nothing to agnes about uriah s plan as she already had enough to worry about a year had passed since i first started work in mr spenlow s firm i often went to court with him and began to understand the details of some of the most difficult cases mr spenlow was kind to me and occasionally talked to me not only about law but also about other matters i discovered that his wife had died and that he lived in a large country house just outside london with his only daughter and her paid companion one day he invited me to his house for the weekend and i accepted gratefully so on friday evening mr spenlow s coach and horses drove us to the house when i saw the spenlows home i realized how rich mr spenlow must be it was a lovely old building with large gar dens as soon as we entered mr spenlow asked one of the servants where s miss dora dora i thought what a beautiful name we went in to the sitting room and i suppose mr spenlow introduced me i did not notice because nothing mattered at that moment i just stared stupidly at his daughter dora lost in wonder at her beauty and unable to say anything i had fallen in love in a second as i stared i heard a voice speaking to me but it was not dora s it was her companion whom i had not noticed at all while mr spenlow was making the introductions when i saw that the companion was miss murdstone i was surprised certainly but nothing could take my attention away from dora for more than a second or two mr spenlow explained that miss murdstone had been kind enough to come and look after his poor motherless daughter and to be her confidential friend and companion but it seemed to me that dora was neither friendly nor confidential towards her stern companion as for me the rest of the weekend passed in a kind of fog we ate meals and went for walks people spoke to me and i answered but i have no idea what i actually said all i re member was dora s golden hair and dora s blushing face and dora s beautiful blue eyes occasionally i was lucky enough to speak to her alone and then i was so shy that i blushed as much as dora herself i was very jealous of the little dog that she carried everywhere with her sometimes i thought she liked me a little and at other times i was sure she would never love me i was wildly desperately in love i had wondered if miss murdstone would try and blacken my name with the spenlows but on that first evening she had taken me to one side david copperfield she said coldly i see no need for either of us to speak about the past to anyone here i imagine we are agreed on that certainly ma am we are agreed on that although i shall never change my opinion of you i put miss murdstone out of my mind and for several weeks after meeting dora i lived in a dream i did my work automatically and i never stopped thinking of her the greatest happiness i could imagine was being engaged to dora i dared not hope that one day we would be married while walking round london one day hoping to meet dora out shopping i met my old schoolfriend tommy traddles he was living in the city like me and was also studying to become a lawyer i arranged to visit him and went to his house after work the next day he lived in one room in a rented house in a very poor part of the city his room was small and almost empty copperfield i m glad to see you he said warmly you can see i haven t got much furniture but i m hoping to earn more money later when i ve finished my studies didn t you have a rich uncle traddles i asked yes but i ve always been unlucky you know he decided he didn t like me so he didn t leave me anything when he died i m really very poor and i have to do several jobs to pay for my studies traddles looked surprisingly cheerful but i must tell you copperfield as you re an old friend that i m engaged to a lovely girl who comes from a large family and lives in devon i was thinking of dora as i shook hands with him and congratulated him enthusiastically will you get married soon i asked no she s very poor too so we ll have to wait a long time until we ve saved enough money she s such a dear girl copperfield she says she ll wait for me until she s sixty if necessary and i m quite happy here with the people who rent the house the micawbers are very kind who did you say i cried the micawbers i know them just then mr micawber himself knocked at the door and entered his stomach was a little fatter and his face a little older than before but he looked as confident as ever i went up to him and shook his hand how are you mr micawber i asked do you remember me is it possible can it be have i the pleasure of seeing my old friend copperfield again he replied a smile spreading over his large face he turned to call downstairs my dear come and meet this gentleman my love when mrs micawber came in she was also delighted to see me and we talked for some time about the twins and the other children and her husband s business interests but this conversation soon made mr micawber rather depressed you see copperfield he said miserably nothing has turned up yet sometimes i wonder whether anything ever will turn up i can t pay for our food or even our water it s hard enough for me to accept the situation but how can i expect my dear wife to live like this perhaps it would have been better if i had never asked her to marry me he put his head in his hands micawber cried his wife how can you say that you know i have always loved and admired you and always will love and admire you my dear husband and they fell into each other s arms sobbing on each other s shoulders in a few moments they had both dried their eyes and looked quite cheerful again i realized that the micawbers had not changed at all but this quick change of mood was rather a surprise for traddles before i left i made sure i had a word in private with my old schoolfriend traddles i whispered take my advice don t lend mr micawber any money he s got a lot of debts traddles looked uncomfortable thank you copperfield he whispered in reply but i ve already lent him some i don t know whether he ll give it back you know how unlucky i am when i got back to my rooms i found steer forth waiting for me there i thought of agnes s warning about him but when i saw his open good looking face i could not believe he could be a bad influence on anyone however there was something rather strange in his manner that night sometimes he seemed quite depressed almost desperate but a minute later he was laughing wildly and i had no idea why he was like that i ve just been to yarmouth david he told me oh i replied you ve seen the peggotty family i expect i haven t seen much of them but i have got some news for you it s about old barkis i m afraid his illness has got much worse and the doctor thinks he ll die very soon oh dear i said poor peggotty will be so sad yes it s bad luck replied steerforth carelessly but people die in this world every minute i m not afraid of death i want to live life in my own way and nobody can stop me he threw his head back proudly i looked into his handsome face wondering why he was so excited which was unusual for him steerforth i think i ll have to go to yarmouth myself i said perhaps i can help peggotty at this difficult time smiling he put his hands on my shoulders i wish i could be as good as you david promise me that if anything ever happens to separate us you ll think of me at my best promise me that steerforth you have no best or worst for me i answered you will always have your place in my heart and as he turned to go he gave me his hand and smiled in his old friendly way that is how i like to remember him now that i shall never touch his hand again or see him smile when i arrived in yarmouth i went straight to barkis s house in the sitting room i found daniel ham and emily ham was standing by the door while emily was sobbing in daniel s arms none of them seemed surprised to see me emily s very young master david explained daniel it s hard for her to accept death that s why she s crying now cheer up emily my dear ham has come to take you home what s that he bent his grey head down to hear her whispered reply you want to stay here with your old uncle but you should go with ham he ll be your husband soon that s all right said ham if it makes emily happy it ll make me happy i ll go home alone he went over to emily and gave her a gentle kiss she seemed to turn away from him a little as ham went out i went upstairs to see poor barkis he was lying unconscious in bed looking very pale and ill peggotty was sitting beside him she jumped up and took me delightedly in her arms just as she used to do then she turned to her husband barkis my dear she said almost cheerfully here s master david who brought us together you remember he carried your messages for you can you speak to him barkis lay silently there not moving we sat beside him all through that long night in the early morning he suddenly opened his eyes reached out his hand to me and said clearly with a pleasant smile barkis is willing and then he closed his eyes and died he was a good man said peggotty with tears in her eyes i shall miss him i was able to help peggotty with the arrangements for the funeral barkis was buried in blunderstone churchyard close to my mother and little brother we discovered that barkis had saved quite a lot of money which he left to peggotty and daniel so i knew that peggotty would not need to work in future on the day before the funeral we all arranged to meet at the old boat it was my last evening in yarmouth as i was re turning to london the following day when i arrived i was surprised to see that ham and emily were not there peggotty was feeling more cheerful now and daniel was talking to her just then ham came to the door master david come outside a minute would you he asked i stepped outside and ham shut the door carefully it was raining heavily and as we stood on the lonely beach i noticed how very pale ham s face was ham i cried what s the matter master david he sobbed wildly i had never seen such a strong man cry like that before it s emily i d have died for her i love her with all my heart but she s run away and worse than that oh how i wish god had saved her from this ruin i shall never fonget his desperate face turned towards me and the pain in his honest eyes you re educated master david he continued you know how to express yourself help me how can i ever ex plain to him in there he loves her even more than i do i saw the door open and tried to stop ham speaking but it was too late daniel peggotty came out and when he saw us he seemed to realize immediately what we were talking about the expression on his face changed in a moment and he pulled us both back inside i found myself with a letter in my hand which ham had given me read it sir said daniek his face pale and trembling and his eyes wild read it slowly please the room was completely silent as i read aloud dear ham please please forgive me for running away and leaving you when you see this i ll be far away i shall never return to my dear home unless he marries me and brings me back as a lady oh i m so sorry and so ashamed i know this will break your heart but believe me i m not good enough for you i m too wicked tell uncle i ll always love him even if he can never love me again and i ll always think of you dear ham even if you hate me for what i ve done forgive me and goodbye emily daniel did not move for a long time after i had finished reading i took his hand but he did not notice suddenly he appeared to wake up and said in a low voice who s the man i want to know his name ham looked quickly at me and i felt a shock run through my whole body i fell on to a chair and could not speak don t listen master david ham said hesitating we don t blame you for it peggotty put her arm round my neck but i could not move a gentleman s been here very often recently continued ham in a broken voice and to day people saw emily driving off with him in his coach tell me cried daniel wildly is his name steerforth it is replied ham just as wildly and i m sorry master david but he s the wickedest man i ve ever known after a moment daniel spoke he looked suddenly much older i wish i d drowned him when i had the chance but it s too late now there s no peace for me here while my dear girl is away i m going to look for her and bring her back home don t any of you try to stop me ham you must stay here in yarmouth keep a light always burning in the window of this house so that if the poor girl ever comes back she can find her way home across the sand i m going to london and france and all over the world if necessary i m prepared to spend my whole life travelling until i find her if anything happens to me if i don t come back tell her i forgive her tell her my love for her is unchanged and although we all tried hard to persuade him to stay he refused to listen he took his coat hat bag and stick and stepped out into the darkness we watched him walking along the london road until he disappeared from sight i often thought of that lonely figure in the next few weeks and months walking through strange streets in foreign cities looking for his adopted child when i thought of him i remembered his last words to us if anything happens to me if i don t come back tell her forgive her tell her my love for her is unchanged good news and bad news for david all this time i had gone on loving dora more than ever the more evil there seemed to be in the world the more brightly dora s star shone down on me i am sure i considered her a beautiful angel far above the rest of us poor humans and i had no real hope of persuading her to love me peggotty had come to london with me as she was feeling rather lonely after barkis s death and daniel s departure and i could not stop myself telling her all about dora she was very interested and most encouraging the young lady should be very proud to have such a hand some intelligent young man as you master davie she cried and i m sure her father will be delighted to accept you as her husband but i could not share her hopeful view of the sitution however a wonderful thing happened during a long conversation with mr spenlow in the office he mentioned that it was dora s birthday the following week and invited me to a picnic to celebrate it as soon as i heard this i went completely mad and could not think at all clearly in the next week i bought expensive new clothes and boots and arranged to hire a handsome white horse on the day of the picnic i got up at six in the morning and went to govent garden market to buy the freshest and most beautiful flowers for dora and by ten o clock i was riding towards the spenlows house how lovely dora looked in her sky blue dress and white hat when i met her in the garden in front of the house and when she accepted my flowers with delight i almost thought i would die of happiness you ll be glad to hear mr copperfield she said smiling prettily that cross miss murdstone isn t here she ll be away for at least three weeks instead i have my dear friend miss julia mills here with me sitting next to dora was a young lady i had not noticed be fore although she was only about twenty she looked very calm and wise i later discovered that she had had an unhappy experience in love and had decided never again to become personally involved in matters of the heart how delightful for you i answered blushing as i always did when i spoke to dora and everything that is delightful to you is delightful to me miss spenlow miss mills said nothing but smiled kindly on us both to get to the picnic place which was some way from the house mr spenlow dora and miss mills drove in an open carriage while i rode by their side on my handsome white horse i shall never have such a ride again dora sat with her back to the horses looking towards me and holding my flowers close to her sweet face our eyes often met and i am surprised i did not fall off my horse i did not notice the dust or the road we were taking sometimes mr spenlow spoke to me about the scenery and i replied politely but i cannot remember what i said all i could see was dora i was very disappointed when we arrived to find that other guests had been invited i wat quite jealous even of the ladies because they talked to dora and took her away from me but i hated all the men as soon as i saw them there was a very unpleasant talkative man with a red moustache who insisted he knew all about preparing food and soon had most of the young ladies round him one of them was dora i felt that he was now my worst enemy when we started eating i saw to my horror that red moustache was sitting with a huge plate of chicken at dora s feet i could not think clearly but i pretended to be cheerful i sat with a young lady dressed in pink and talked amusingly to her and looked at her and fetched her whatever she needed sometimes i looked over at dora and she looked back at me but she had red moustache and i had the young lady in pink after the meal the young lady s mother took her away and i walked alone into a wood feeling angry and desperate i was just planning to ride away on my handsome white horse although i did not know where to when i saw dora and miss mills coming to meet me mr copperfield said miss mills you are unhappy no no miss mills i protested firmly perfectly happy and dora continued miss mills you are unhappy oh good heavens no julia cried dora not at all mr copperfield and dora said miss mills looking old and wise enough of this foolishness you love each other confess it and be happy take the chance that life offers you listen to one who speaks from bitter experience i was so hot and excited that i took dora s little hand immediately and kissed it and she let me i kissed miss mills s hand too and life seemed wonderful again dora shyly put her arm in mine and we walked about together until much too soon we heard the other guests calling her name so we had to go back and when they wanted dora to sing a song red moustache offered to fetch the guitar from the carriage for her but dora told him nobody except me knew where it was so i fetched the guitar and i held her gloves and i sat beside her while she sang and i knew that in that great crowd of people she was singing only for me who loved her when the guests left i rode beside the carriage all the way back to the spenlows house mr spenlow who had drunk a lot of wine was asleep in his seat and miss mills was smiling in a motherly way as dora and i whispered happily to each other once miss mills called me to her side of the carriage dora is coming to stay with me she told me quietly the day after tomorrow perhaps you would like to visit us miss mills how can i ever thank you i said what a friend you are to miss spenlow and me when we arrived at the spenlows house i had to say goodbye to dora and ride back to london on the way i remembered everything she had done or said ten thousand times i decided i had to tell her i loved her as soon as possible and ask whether she loved me too it was the most important question in the world and only dora could give me the answer to it so two days later i dressed in my finest clothes and went to the address miss mills had given me the servant took me to the sittingroom where i found julia mills learning a song and dora painting the flowers i had given her after a short conversation miss mills made an excuse and left the room and dora and i were alone together i hope your poor horse wasn t tired the other night said dora raising her beautiful eyes to mine it was a long way for him to and from the picnic place i must ask her today i thought my whole body was trembling it was a long way for him i answered for me it seemed very short because of my happiness in being so near you there was a moment s silence then dora said you didn t seem to care for that happiness earlier in the day when you were sitting with the lady in pink but i expect you don t mean what you say and of course you re quite free to do whatever you like i don t know how i did it it happened so quickly suddenly i had dora in my arms and i couldn t stop speaking i told her how i loved her i told her i would die without her and when she blushed and cried a little i said i had loved her day and night since the moment i had first seen her i told her that nobody had ever loved or could ever love as much as i loved her somehow i found myself sitting quietly next to dora on the sofa holding her little hand we were engaged i suppose we realized that one day we would get married but for the moment we were going to keep our engagement secret from mr spenlow when miss mills came in she was delighted to hear our news and promised to help us as much as possible now began one of the happiest times of my life when i look back i see how foolish i was but how loving and sincere i visited dora every day and i did not have time for anyone or anything else but in the middle of my excitement i suddenly thought of agnes of her clear calm eyes and her gentle face and i sat down immediately to write to her and tell her all about dora i knew that as my adopted sister she would share my happiness and i wanted her approval one day when peggotty and i were having tea in my flat tommy traddles came to visit me my dear copperfield he cried i ve been several times before but you ve been out my dear traddles i replied yes i m very sorry i ve been visiting my miss d you know i expect she lives in london doesn t she mine that s sopby beautiful name isn t it mine lives in devon i think i told you so i don t see her very often she really is the dearest girl she s very busy at home you know looking after the other nine children and her mother who s unable to walk what a wonderful girl she must be i agreed politely and tell me traddles how is mr micawber i m not living in his house at the moment said traddles because his creditors demanded payment of his debts recently and he had to move to another house to avoid these unpleasant men he s even changed his name to mortimer and he only comes out of the house after dark wearing glasses so nothing has turned up for him yet and what abut the money you lent him traddles i m afraid i may not get it back but mr micawber promises to give it back one day he s a fine honest man isn t he and traddles looked hopefully at me before i could reply we heard footsteps on the stairs i was very surprised to see my aunt coming upstairs she was carrying two cases and her cat and was followed closely by mr dick carrying two more cases my dear aunt i cried what an unexpected pleasure we kissed each other and i shook hands with mr dick traddles left quietly as he could see we would be discussing family matters peggotty made some more tea for my aunt who had sat down heavily on her cases dear aunt i said make yourself more comfortable sit in an armchair or sit on the sofa why do you think i m sitting on my cases she asked looking seriously at me i shook my head unable to guess because what i m sitting on is all i have because i ve lost all my money my dear i couldn t have been more shocked if the house and all of us in it had fallen into the river thames yes continued my aunt putting her head calmly on my shoulder i ll tell you all about it tomorrow david but tonight we must find a bed for mr dick and i ll sleep here to save money so that night my aunt agreed to take my bed while i planned to sleep on the sitting room sofa and i took mr dick to a neighbour s house to rent a room when i returned i found my aunt walking up and down in front of the sitting room fire that peggotty woman is very fond of you david she said she s been offering to give us some of her money the money she inherited from her husband of course i refused at once but she s a good woman and she s been telling me about the trouble at yarmouth yes poor emily i could not stop myself saying silly emily you mean but i m sorry for you because you cared for her once and now peggotty tells me you re in love again i blushed i love dora with all my heart aunt i suppose the little thing is very lovely is she no one can imagine how lovely she is she isn t at all silly is she asked my aunt i had never considered this possibility before and could only repeat what my aunt had said silly aunt well well i only ask replied my aunt gently david you re very loving like your poor mother and you need a good serious sensible person to love aunt if you only knew how sensible dora is i replied oh david she answered blind blind blind this made me feel a little uncomfortable but i was glad she knew my secret i thought perhaps she was rather tiredt so i said goodnight she went to my bedroom and i lay down on the sofa how miserable i was that night i knew i should be thinking of my poor aunt s situation but i could not prevent myself from thinking of dora how could i marry her if i had no money no expensive clothes to wear no handsome white horse to ride or flowers to give her the next morning i got up early to have a walk in the fresh air and on the way home a carriage stopped beside me and agnes wickfield got out i immediately felt better when i saw her beautiful calm face smiling at me she had heard that my aunt was in trouble and had come to london to see her we walked together to my flat you know that uriah heep is my father s partner now she said quietly his influence over my father is far too great father is much much worse he looks years older and i m afraid that encouraged by uriah he drinks more than ever uriah and his old mother live with us now so i can t always be with father to to protect him from whatever uriah is planning i just hope that love and truth will always be stronger than evil i could not give her my opinion of uriah because by then we had arrived at the flat my aunt was very pleased to see agnes again and made us sit down on the sofa next to peggotty now let me explain to you all what happened to my money said my aunt firmly i was surprised to see that agnes was pale and trembling betsey trotwood continued i saved a lot of money over the years and my lawyer mr wickfield used to help me invest it in the right companies but recently i thought he wasn t such a good lawyer as he used to be so i decided to invest my money myself what a lot of mistakes i made who knows where it s gone in gold and foreign banks and so on it s no good worrying about it but i can tell you there s nothing left the colour was beginning to return to agnes s face so it it wasn t my father s fault dear miss trotwood not at all agnes said my aunt cheerfully now can any of you give me some advice i ve asked my servant janet to rent my little house in kent that will bring in about seventy pounds a year i think we ll need more than that to live on you and david could share this flat very cheaply with mr dick just round the corner in his rented room suggested agnes and i think i can find a little job for david do you remember dr strong the headmaster of the canterbury school now that he s retired and come to live in london he needs a private secretary to work for him in the mornings and evenings at his house he was asking father about it the other day what do you think agnes i cried what would we do without you you are my good angel i told you so before i could easily be dr strong s secretary as well as continuing my work in mr spenlow s firm i ll go and see him today and arrange it with him agnes gave me her beautiful smile as she got up to leave i went downstairs with her and as we walked together to the coach station i saw an old beggar with a white stick in the street he was holding out his thin hand for money and crying blind blind blind it sounded like an echo of what my aunt had said the day before oh agnes dear sister if i had only known then what i discovered long afterwards david s new life with agnes s encouragement i felt much stronger and no longer depressed my life now bad a purpose i intended to work as hard as i could to help my aunt and to earn enough money to marry dora i got up every morning at five o clock walked to dr strong s house on the other side of london worked with him for two hours every morning and then walked back to mr spenlow s office where i spent most of the day in the lawcourts then i returned to dr strong s for two or three more hours in the evening and finally came home to my flat where my aunt peggotty and mr dick would be waiting for me i was glad to be able to tell my aunt that dr strong would pay me seventy pounds a year for my work with that and the rent from my aunt s house in kent we could live quite well if we were careful because i was young and healthy i did not mind hard work and whenever i was tired i told myself you re doing it for dora and that made me work even harder when i met traddles one day near the courts i told him about my new situation and he was very sympathetic but i have news for you too copperfield he said the micawbers are moving to canterbury oh that means something must have turned up for them i replied interested yes mr micawber is going to become assistant to someone called uriah heep a partner in a firm of canterbury lawyers heep i cried in horror i know him why would mr micawber want to work for him well i do know that heep has paid all mr micawber s debts in london answered traddles the whole family is leaving tomorrow they asked me to tell you i wondered why heep wanted micawber to work for him and i felt sure uriah had some evil plan in his ugly head the next day peggotty was returning to yarmouth to look after ham while daniel was away after i had taken her to the coach station and said goodbye to her i hurried to miss mills s house i had not yet told dora about the changes in my life because i had not wanted to explain it all in a letter but today she was visiting julia mills and was expecting me to come to tea how happy and heautiful dora looked when she met me in the sitting room and how shocked and miserable she looked when i asked her immediately can you love a beggar dora my pretty little dora she had no idea what i meant don t be silly david she cried what are you talking about it s true dora my love i cried i ve lost all my money i m a beggar and i looked so serious that dora was frightened and began to sob bitterly on my shoulder but i love you dora and always will i continued it doesn t matter if we are poor because i ll work hard to buy our bread we don t need much as long as we have each other tell me your heart is still mine dear dora oh yes she cried oh yes it s all yours only don t frighten me again don t talk of hard work and bread i don t understand i hardly ever eat bread i loved her more than ever but i felt she was not very practical in a few moments when she had stopped crying and was calmer i tried again to make her understand my dearest may i mention something oh please don t be practical begged dora tears coming to her lovely eyes it frightens me so much my dear one if we work together and share our problems it will make us and our love stronger but i m not strong at all she cried miserably ask julia she ll tell you i m weak and foolish but if you thought sometimes my sweet dora that you are engaged to a poor man if you tried to see how your father manages the servants or how much food costs in the markets it would be helpful to us we must be brave dear dora our path in life is steep and rocky i was becoming quite enthusiastic but i suddenly realized i had said far too much poor little dora was sobbing and screaming with fear and in a moment was lying unconscious on the sofa i really thought i had killed her i threw water on her face and went down on my knees to ask her to forgive me i called myself a selfish heartless creature and shouted for julia mills at last she hurried in and i explained what had happened when dora opened her eyes her friend helped her upstairs while dora was upstairs washing her face and calming herself i asked miss mills s advice on the best way to encourage dora to become more practical miss mills shook her head sadly i must be honest with you mr copperfield our dearest dora is a beautiful innocent child of nature full of light and happiness she is above the things of this world which we poor humans have to worry about i think you ll just have to accept that fact when dora came downstairs again she looked so lovely that i felt bitterly angry with myself for making her unhappy even for a moment we had tea and she sang her french songs to me and played the guitar we were happy again until the moment when i stupidly mentioned that i had to get up at five o clock the next morning suddenly her pretty face looked sad and she did not play or sing again when i got up to go she came up close to me and said lovingly you bad boy don t be so silly don t get up at five o clock why should you but my love i have work to do i have to work in order to live i replied work don t be so foolish david dear and she seemed to think that was the end of the matter as she gave me a kiss straight from her innocent little heart i loved her and went on loving her but i went on working hard too and worrying about earning money some evenings as i sat opposite my aunt in my little sitting room at the end of another exhausting day i was quite frightened when i thought of the problems i was going to have to solve alone several months passed in this way dora and i wrote to each other every day and occasionally i was able to visit her at miss mills s house but one morning when i arrived at the office for work mr spenlow greeted me very coldly and asked me to step into his office where we could talk privately when i entered the room i was surprised to see miss murd stone standing by his desk staring unpleasantly at me i knew at once that dora s father had discoversd our secret and i guessed who had told him mr copperfield said mr spenlow frowning sternly at me i am sorry to say that miss murdstone has found some letters which appear to be from you to my daughter dora are they yours i looked at the letters he handed to me blushed and whispered yes sir poor little dora i hoped she had not been frightened by that horrible murdstone woman i hated to think of dora s unhappiness at losing my letters i suspected something was wrong when miss spenlow came back from her last visit to miss mills said miss murd stone looking very pleased with herself i always said julia mills was not a suitable friend for miss spenlow and i was right mr spenlow appeared to agree but rather sadly i am very sorry sir i said but it is all my fault please don t blame dora miss spenlow to you young man said her father angrily i know it wasn t right to keep it secret sir but i love your daughter and i hope that one day don t speak to me of love mr copperfield cried mr spenlow you are both much too young we ll throw these letters in the fire and you must promise to forget the whole thing there is no question of your marrying dora but sir i can t forget her i love her i protested that is my last word m copperfield when you have time to consider you ll realize it s wiser to do as i say now go to your work i spent all day thinking of poor sweet dora and how she must be feeling in the evening i hurried round to miss mills s house but although she spoke wisely of love and broken hearts she could not offer me any practical advice the next day after a sleepless night i arrived at the office at the normal time and discovered all the clerks standing talking at the front door this was so unusual that i stopped to ask what had happened why don t you know asked one of them the police have found mr spenlow dead i fell back shocked you look very pale mr copperfield said another sit down here sir tell me tell me what happened i gasped well he went into town to dinner last night and the carriage and horses came back at midnight without him he was driving himself you see so the servants went to look for him and found him dead in the road he must have been ill and have fallen out of the carriage anyway he was dead when they found him this was a terrible shock to me perhaps his anger with me had made him ill in that case i was partly to blame for his death but i am sorry to say i was also jealous of dora s sadness white she was crying for her dead father she was not thinking of me and i selfishly wanted to be the only person in her life in the next few weeks i became quite desperate because i could not see or speak to my sweet dora miss mills reported that dora cried all day and when my name was mentioned only sobbed more loudly and said oh poor dear father how wicked of me to keep a secret from him oh oh so i did not feel encouraged to visit her soon after her father s funeral dora was taken to live with her two aunts at putney in south london where she seemed to be further away from me than ever my aunt meanwhile began to be seriously worried about my health as i was getting more and more depressed so she suggested i should go to dover for a few days to make sure that her house was still in good condition and then to canter bury to visit the wickfields i agreed willingly as i was always happy to see agnes it was easy to take a few day s hoilday from my work at the lawcourts and with dr strong i was glad to find that the person who was renting my aunt s house in dover was looking after it well i was then free to continue my journey to canterbury that beautiful ancient city which seemed very little changed since my schooldays the soft clean air made me feel better than i had done for weeks when i arrived at the wickfields house i found mr micawber in uriah heep s old office we were pleased to see each other but we both felt a little embarrassed i realized that he did not want to talk about confidential matters concerning the firm of heep and wickfield and he knew that i disliked his employer heep so conversation was difficult and in the end i was glad to leave him and go upstairs to look for agnes i found her in her sitting room and she looked up at me with such a warm welcome in her smile that i was very moved ah agnes i sald i ve missed you so much recently you helped me such a lot in the old days that i suppose i never learnt to think for myself i always feel i need your help and advice i get into such trouble and i get so worried and have so little confidence in myself but when i m with you you give me purpose you make me strong what is your secret my dear adopted sister agnes gave me her hand which i kissed and she went on in her sisterly way to listen sympathetically as i told her everything that had happened in the past few weeks as usual she knew the right thing to do she advised me to write to dora s aunts to ask if i could visit dora occasionally and she encouraged me in my hopes of marriage i felt again that peace which agnes always brought to me we had not been sitting together long when mrs heep came in she did not leave us for a moment all that evening and i wondered whether uriah had told her to watch over us whenever i looked at agnes s lovely face i saw mrs heep s evil black eyes staring at me the next day mrs heep did not leave agnes and me alone even for a minute the heeps mother and son seemed to me like two ugly great black birds hanging over the house and they made me so uncomfortable that i went out for a walk in the afternoon i was walking along a path near the house wondering if i should warn agnes about uriah s plan of marriage when i heard footsteps behind me and turned to see uriah himself running after me wait for me mr copperfield he cried actually i said i came out to be alone ah he said with his oily smile you don t like my mother being there all the time do you no i don t i replied not caring if i sounded rude but you see he continued in my humble position i have to be very careful i m not married to my agnes yet and you re a dangerous rival mr copperfield what i cried in disgust you allow miss wickfield no peace in her own home because of me don t you realize i think of her as my very dear sister nothing more let me tell you i am engaged to another lady there is that enough for you oh mr copperfield cried uriah gratefully shaking my hand with his cold fishy one i ll tell mother to stop watching you at once why didn t you tell me that before i know you ve never liked and trusted me as i ve liked you we returned to the house together in silence that evening after dinner when agnes and mrs heep had left us uriah said to mr wickfield let s have some wine partner and drink to young mr copperfield s health it isn t often we have the pleasure of his company is it partner i knew uriah was deliberately encouraging mr wickfield to drink too much but i saw that although agnes s father was aware of his weakness he could no longer stop himself as the evening passed i was disgusted to see that uriah became more and more cheerful as mr wickfield became more and more drunk finally uriah stood up with a glass in his hand come partner he said with his evil smile let s drink to the health of the most beautiful woman in the world poor broken mr wickfield looked for a moment at the picture of his dead wife on the wall so similar to agnes i may be humble continued uriah but i admire no i love your daughter agnes suddenly a horrible cry came from mr wickfield he had stood up and was screaming with anger he behaved so wildly and desperately that i thought he had gone mad my child and you heep no never you ve taken everything from me my business my good name my home but you ll never take her perhaps i ve said too much too soon said uriah looking uncomfortable but you ll be sorry partner if you say any more you need me remember you ve got nothing without me remember that before you accuse me of anything just then the door opened and agnes entered silently you re not well father come with me she whispered gently and helped the ashamed old man out i thought she must have heard what had been said later that night she came to say goodnight to me in the sitting room where i was alone reading agnes my dear sister i said to her promise me that you will never agree to marry that evil creature for any reason through her tears she smiled calmly at me don t worry brother i m not afraid of him my duty is to take care of father and i trust in god for the rest goodnight david david gets married when i returned to london i was delighted to discover that dora s aunts had decided to allow me to visit her so every saturday and sunday i walked to their house in putney and spent the afternoons there sometimes dora sang or played the guitar sometimes we walked by the river and sometimes i brought traddles or my aunt with me what happy times they were mr spenlow had seemed a very rich man to me but when he died the lawyers discovered that dora would not inherit much from him after all as there were many debts to pay so i did not feel worried that anyone would suspect me of marrying dora for her money mr spenlow s firm lost a lot of business after his death and i realized i would have to find another profession i had always been good at writing so i continued as secretary to dr strong and also began reporting what was said in parliament for the daily newspapers i even wrote some stories which were published in magazines and was very pleased with the money i was earning the months passed and i reached my twenty first birthday traddles was still studying to be a lawyer and still hoping to marry the dearest girl in the world i had moved out of my flat into a pleasant little house and at last dora s aunts had agreed to our marriage i was looking forward to the happiest day of my life the next few days went by very fast in a mist of excitement and happiness my aunt and mr dick moved into an even smaller house near mine and peggotty travelled from yarmouth to be present at my wedding i had always wanted agnes to meet dora so i was glad when they met the day before the wedding it was beautiful to see dora s pretty face next to agnes s calm one and dora whispering her secrets into agnes s ears as a child does to its mother but after agnes had gone to see my aunt dora said seriously to me when we were alone perhaps if i d had agnes as a friend when i was younger david dear i wouldn t be so foolish and silly but i love you as you are dora i replied i wonder why you ever fell in love with me because nobody can see you and not fall in love with you but if you d never seen me david i wonder who you d have married i laughed and kissed her pretty lips and she was soon as cheerful as usual again i cannot remember much about the wedding except dora by my side in her beautiful dress and with a blushing face only when we were driving away from putney together did i wake from the dream i believed it at last it was my dear little wife i was sitting next to whom i loved so much it seemed strange to return from our week s holiday and to find myself in my own small house with dora it was difficult to believe that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together but soon i realized that married life was not as comfortable as it appeared neither dora nor i knew anything about managing the house we had a servant of course who managed us she served our meals late drank all our wine and stole all our silver spoons when she finally left we had another who behaved in a similar way i felt i had to speak to dora about it my love i began couldn t you perhaps control the servants a little better david don t be cross with your little dora she said coming to sit on my knee but i wanted to show i could be firm my sweet dora i really do think you should do something i mean yesterday i had no supper at all because the beef was burnt and last week when traddles came to dinner the meat wasn t cooked at all you knew before you married me what a silly girl i am you shouldn t have married me if you were going to be angry with me i don t think you love me at all and large tears ran down her pretty little face dora my love of course i love you don t cry i could not continue our conversation then but when she was calmer and had dried her tears she said very seriously david will you do something for me will you call me your child wife whatever do you mean my dearest i asked in surprise just that whenever you feel i m being very foolish you should remember that i m like a child not as clever as you or anyone else don t be disappointed with me just remember that your child wife loves you very very much of all the conversations we had i remember that one very clearly it made a strong impression on me and i am glad now that i did not try to change dora any more i had fallen in love with an innocent child like girl and i could not expect her to become a wise experienced woman in such a short time but this meant that i had to carry all our problems on my own shoulders and sometimes i felt sorry that i did not have a real partner in life with whom to share these worries at about this time my first book was published and was a great success dora and my aunt were equally proud of me i was becoming however rather worried about dora she had been ill for some time and did not seem to be getting better she was not strong and could not walk anywhere by herself i began to carry her downstairs every morning and upstairs every night and my aunt came every day to look after her my little wife was still very pretty and cheerful but i knew how light she was and how weak i began to fear she would not be with me for much longer early one morning when i was walking in the garden i saw danie i peggotty opening the gate and coming towards me his clothes were dusty and he looked older than before with white hair escaping untidily from under his hat but his face was brown and he looked healthy and strong master david he said gladly when he saw me i ve come to tell you you were always our friend i ve found her you ve found little emily i cried delightedly but whereand how i heard she d travelled with that wicked steerforth to italy and lived there for a while but in the end he became tired of her and left her she didn t know what to do or where to go poor thing but she came back to london and that s where i found my dear child because i ve been all over europe looking for her but i knew she d come back to england one day so every night i ve been searching the city streets for her and last night i found her hopeless and exhausted on a bridge looking down into the river if i hadn t found her then i don t like to think what she would have done but god was looking after my dear girl and she s safe with me now he passed his strong hand over his eyes and smiled at me i ve planned what we ll do master david and i want to tell you about it emily and i are going to australia it s a new country where nobody knows anything about her past we ll be able to start a new life together we ll be leaving in about six weeks very sensible i said and what about the rest of your family are ham and peggotty going to australia too no they aren t poor ham will never be the same again i really think his heart is broken but he s got a good job and is very popular in yarmouth so he ll stay there my sister wants to stay too partly because of you master david and partly to look after ham she cooks and cleans for him in yarmouth you know well my friend i said shaking hands firmly with the old boatman i wish you and emily all the best in your new life i ll do my duty whether i m in england or australia said daniel and i ll never be separated from my little emily again death and discovery traddles and i had both received rather strange letters from mr micawber in which he asked us to come to canterbury with my aunt at this meeting he said he would show to all of us the proof of uriah heep s wickedness dora was too ill to come with us so traddles my aunt mr dick and i travelled to canterbury by coach spent the night in a hotel there and arrived punctually at the wickfields house the next morning mr micawber met us at the door and showed us into uriah heep s office uriah himself seemed rather surprised to see us but pretended to welcome us as old friends mr micawber brought agnes into the room too and then stood firmly by the door don t wait micawber said uriah to his assistant but mr micawber did not move he stared coldly at his employer did you hear what i said micawber said uriah angrily his little eyes becoming redder while his long face went very pale yes replied micawber but i don t choose to leave listen to me heep i don t care if i lose my job i don t wish to work any longer for the wickedest man in england uriah fell back shocked looking slowly round at us with a dark evil expression on his face he said i see you ve all arranged this between you but i know who to blame for this it s you copperfield you re jealous of my new position aren t you but i know things about all of you which i can use against you for example i know about your father s business mistakes miss agnes and i know about your past in the warehouse copperfield so be careful i warn you all mr micawber i said calmly please tell us what you were going to say about this man just then traddles who had disappeared a few minutes before reappeared with mrs heep uriah had not noticed traddles before who are you he demanded angrily i am a lawyer and a friend of mr wickfield sir said traddles in a businesslike way and he s asked me to carry out all his business arrangements from now on this came as a surprise to me as well as to uriah the old fool has been drinking too much again said uriah looking uglier than ever you can t believe anything he says and you ve bribed my assistant i suppose to speak against me it s you who have been dishonest said traddles firmly as we shall hear from mr micawber and we all looked expectantly towards that large important looking gentleman he was clearly delighted to have such an interested audience and cleared his throat several times before starting to speak as he spoke his voice became louder and louder with excitement until he was almost shouting ladies and gentlemen he began when very poor and desperate for work i came to canterbury as assistant to this evil man heep i am sorry to say i was soon involved in all his wicked plans i may be poor but i can t accept his lies his cheating his bribes and all the rest of it and so i ve brought you here today ladies and gentlemen to hear me accuse heep publicly one he has confused and lied to his partner so often that poor mr wickfield now thinks he has himself been dishonest two he has sometimes copied mr wickfield s signature on to false documents and cheques three for years he has been stealing large amounts of money from mr wickfield and the firm you can never prove it cried uriah wildly i have taken copies of all the necessary documents said mr micawber confidently while working as your clerk and just to make sure i ve given them to mr traddles to keep safely uriah my dear boy cried his mother sobbing bitterly tell them how humble you are say you didn t mean to hurt anyone say you re sorry and arrange matters with these gentlemen do dear boy mother be quiet he whispered angrily don t help my enemies copperfield here would have given you a hundred pounds to say what you ve just said suddenly my aunt attacked uriah hitting his head with her umbrella give me back my investments she cried i thought mr wickfield had lost my money and i didn t want to hurt agnes by saying so but now i know you ve had control of the firm and you ve stolen my money somehow i managed to get her away from him before she hurt him too badly then mrs heep fell on her knees to all of us begging us to forgive her dear boy and to remember how humble he always was be silent mother said her son he turned to traddles and asked unpleasantly well what are you asking me to do not asking demanding heep you will give us the keys to all your boxes and drawers all your documents and cheque books everything in fact that belongs to the firm you will stay in this house until we ve checked all the documents and if i don t agree he asked frowning copperfield perhaps you would fetch a couple of policemen things move slowly in the lawcourts but in the end mr wickfield will get his business back and you heep will be in prison for a very long time uriah realized that he had to do what we wanted and went to fetch the documents with mr dick at his side at the door with his blackest most evil expression heep turned and said to me i ve always hated you copperfield then he was taken away in the next few days traddles and micawber worked very hard together to put right what uriah had done they discovered my aunt s money and gave it back to her and paid all the firm s debts mr wickfield decided to sell his business and retire the wickfields would not have much money but at least they did not owe anything in the end uriah heep and his mother left canterbury but we all thought he was too evil to stay out of trouble for long my aunt had a wonderful idea for the micawber family have you ever thought of going to live in australia she suggested it s a new country with a lot of business opportunities mr micawber was very interested something could easily turn up there he agreed my aunt generously offered to lend him the necessary money to pay for the journey and the whole micawber family started planning and packing immediately when i returned to london i realized my poor dora was much worse she stayed upstairs all the time now and the sitting room seemed very quiet without my little child wife in her usual place one day when i was sitting with her in her room she said lovingly you know david dear i m afraid i was too young don t say that dora i whispered conscious that she was speaking of herself in the past i was a silly little girl david and you know it it s just as well that i won t live much longer perhaps if i lived you d wish you d married someone more sensible more practical someone like she did not finish what she was saying but we ve been so happy dora i said trying not to cry she took my band and kissed it we have haven t we david do you think if you asked agnes she d come and see me i have something particular to say to her of course my love i ll write to her tonight agnes came the next day and went straight upstairs to see dora although the doctor and my aunt had told me there was no hope that dora would live when i held her hand and saw her love for me in her innocent blue eyes i could not believe she would be taken from me but when agnes came downstairs so calmly and silently and said nothing but raised her hand and pointed upwards i knew it was over and i remembered only darkness for a long time afterwards in the middle of my terrible sadness i received a message from emily she asked me to take a letter from her to ham her last words to the man who had loved her so much before she and daniel left england for australia they were sailing in two weeks time and the micawbers were going on the same ship i remembered my childish love for little emily and agreed to do what she asked the weather was very stormy as i travelled through the night to yarmouth several times the coach was almost knocked off the road by the wind and the rain by the time we arrived in yarmouth most of the local people were in the streets afraid to stay in their houses in case the roof or the chimney blew down many women were crying afraid for their husbands or brothers who were out fishing in their small boats the sea itself with its huge waves crashing noisily on the beach frightened us all very much i went to the hotel and tried to sleep a little after my tiring journey but the wind made so much noise that i could not sleep and i went down to the beach again where a lot of people were standing together watching the waves by now the storm had got even worse two ships have gone down sir a local fisherman shouted to me a few miles away we couldn t save any of the men on them the waves were too high and look there s another and suddenly i gasped in horror i could see a great ship which had been pushed violently on to the rocks by the waves it was in danger of falling back into the waves or of breaking in half at any moment several figures were visible on the ship especially one very active curly haired young man who seemed to be giving orders the crowd on the beach cried out as the ship rolled and a huge wave swept over it carrying the men into the rushing water in a moment the only figure we could see was the curly haired young man holding desperately on to the side of the ship and calling for help what could we do it was certain death for any man to enter those waves just then i saw ham peggotty running through the crowd to the edge of tm water one end of a rope was tied around his waist and the other end was held firmly be three strong men standing on the beach no ham i cried trying to hold him back don t try to rescue that poor sailor you ll kill yourself let me go master david he replied cheerfully shaking both my hands if god thinks it s time for me to die then i m ready friends i m going in give me more rope he dived in under a great wave and swam strongly towards the ship in another moment he would have reached it when a high green hill of water appeared and the ship went down with a great crash the people on the beach pulled on ham s rope and he arrived at my feet dead they carried him to the nearest house and i called a doctor but nothing could be done for him he had been beaten to death by that great wave and his generous heart had stopped for ever as i sat hopelessly by his bed a fisherman who had known me when emily and i were children came to tell me he recognized the curly haired sailor whose body had been thrown out of the water by the waves i went to see and there on the beach where she and i had played i saw steerforth lying with his handsome face on his arm he would never smile at me or emily again i was surrounded by too many ghosts to return to london and my old life i was selfishly sad that i had lost my child wife and my childhood friend and sometimes i felt i wanted to die so i left england and travelled for many months in europe i lived in a dark miserable dream with no hope or interest in my future one evening i arrived in a village in switzerland and received a packet of letters that had been waiting for me the first one i opened was from agnes she gave me no advice but she told me simply that she trusted me to find a purpose in life and that she would always be proud of me and love me as a sister as the light died out of the sky and i watched the colour of the snow on the mountain tops change i felt i was waking from my unhappy dream and i began to understand how much i loved agnes she had been the one who had always guided and supported me and now i realized i needed her love for the rest of my life had falling in love with dora been a mistake we had both been very young it is true i had always called agnes sister and now perhaps i no longer had the right to ask whether her love for me was more than sisterly however i decided to return and travelled home to england after three years of absence i was delighted to find that traddles had married his sophy and was doing well as a lawyer my aunt had moved back to her old dover house and was living happily there with mr dick and peggotty when i visited my aunt i took the opportunity of asking her about agnes has she has she any young man she d like to marry i asked as lightly as possible my aunt looked carefully at me as she replied i suspect she has david she s never mentioned it to me but i think i feel sure she s going to marry soon i was firm with myself and did not show my feelings i borrowed a horse and rode to canterbury to ask agnes myself when i saw that beautiful gentle face again i knew i had come home i knew how dear she was to me and would always be agnes i said i am so grateful to you for making me what i am for helping me to be good but i think you have a secret let me share it agnes as your brother tell me whom you love agnes turned away from me and burst into tears somehow these tears did not sadden me but gave me hope my dear agnes don t cry david leave me i can t talk about it now she sobbed agnes you re dearer to me than anything in the world don t think i ll be jealous of any man you choose to marry i only want you to be happy she had stopped crying now and was calmer if i have a secret david it is not a new one it has been my secret for a long time i was wild with hope not a new one did she mean dearest agnes dare i hope to call you more than a sister she was in my arms and sobbing again but this time with happiness i went away agnes loving you i returned home loving you we held each other for some time sure now of each other s love there is something i must tell you david she said gently looking calmly into my face i have loved you all my life she added and something else before our sweet dora died she asked me can you guess to fill the empty place in your heart and agnes laid her head on my shoulder and cried and i cried with her although we were both so happy my story has almost come to an end i have published several books now and i am a well known writer agnes and i have been married for twenty years and live in perfect happiness with our children around us we have heard from daniel peggotty in australia he and emily have made friends there and are happy mr micawber has become an important figure in a large australian town and his family are quite used to living there my aunt mr dick and peggotty are all white haired and old now but still very fit and they love playing with our children whenever they can my old friend traddles has two sons of his own and will soon become a judge when i think of my friends and family agnes s lovely face shines above them all she is here next to me as i write and i hope that when my life comes to its end she will be with me in the shadows pointing upwards to the light txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com gabriel oak falls in love gabriel oak was a sensible man of good character who had been brought up by his father as a shepherd and then managed to save enough money to rent his own farm on norcombe hill in dorset he was twenty eight a tall well built man who did not seem however to think his appear ance was very important one winter morning he was in one of his fields on the side of norcombe hill looking over his gate gabriel could see a yellow cart loaded with furniture and plants coming up the road right on top of the pile sat a handsome young woman as gabriel was watching the cart stopped at the top of the hill and the driver climbed down to go back and fetch some thing that had fallen off the girl sat quietly in the sunshine for a few minutes then she picked up a parcel lying next to her and looked round to see if the driver was coming back there was no sign of him she unwrapped the parcel and took out the mirror it con tained the sun shone on her lovely face and hair although it was december she looked almost summery sitting there in her bright red jacket with the fresh green plants around her she looked at herself in the mirror and smiled thinking that only the birds could see her but behind the gate gabriel oak was watching too she must be rather vain he thought she doesn t need to look in that mirror at all as the girl smiled and blushed at herself she seemed to be dreaming dreaming perhaps of men s hearts won and lost when she heard the driver s footsteps she packed the mirror away the cart moved on downhill to the toll gate gabriel followed on foot as he came closer he could hear the driver arguing with the gatekeeper my mistress s niece that s her on top of the furniture is not going to pay you the extra twopence said the driver she says she s offered you quite enough already well if she doesn t pay the toll your mistress s niece can t pass through the gate replied the gatekeeper gabriel thought that twopence did not seem worth bothering about so he stepped forward here he said handing the coins to the gatekeeper let the young woman pass the girl in the red jacket looked carelessly down at gabriel and told her man to drive on without even thanking the farmer gabriel and the gatekeeper watched the cart move away that s a lovely young woman said the gatekeeper but she has her faults answered gabriel true farmer and the greatest of them is what it always is with women wanting to win the argument every time oh you re right no her great fault is that she s vain a few days later at nearly midnight on the longest night of the year gabriel oak could be heard playing his flute on nor combe hill the sky was so clear and the stars so visible that the earth could almost be seen turning in that cold hard air the sweet notes of the flute rang out the music came from a little hut on wheels standing in the corner of a field shep herds huts like this are used as a shelter during the winter and spring when shepherds have to stay out all night in the fields looking after very young lambs gabriel s two hundred and fifty sheep were not yet paid for he knew that in order to make a success of the farming business he had to make sure they produced a large number of healthy lambs so he was determined to spend as many nights as necessary in the fields to save his lambs from dying of cold or hunger the hut was warm and quite comfortable inside there was a stove and some bread and beer on a shelf on each side of the hut was a round hole like a window which could be closed with a piece of wood these air holes were usually kept open when the stove was burning because too much smoke in a small airless hut could kill the shepherd from time to time the sound of the flute stopped and gabriel came out of his hut to check his sheep whenever he discovered a half dead new lamb he brought the creature into the hut in front of the stove it soon came back to life and then he could return it to its mother he noticed a light further down the hill it came from a wooden hut at the edge of a field he walked down to it and put his eye to a hole in the wood inside two women were feeding a sick cow one of the women was middle aged the other was young and wore a cloak gabriel could not see her face i think she ll be all right now aunt said the younger woman i can come and feed her again in the morning what a pity i lost my hat on the way here just then the girl dropped her cloak and her long hair fell on to the shoulders of her red jacket gabriel recognized the girl of the yellow cart and the mirror the girl who owed him twopence the women left the hut and gabriel returned to his sheep as the sun was rising the next morning gabriel waited out side his hut until he saw the young woman riding up the hill she was sitting sideways on the horse in the usual lady s posi tion he suddenly thought of the hat she had lost searched for it and found it among some leaves on the ground he was just going to go up to her to give it back when the girl did some thing very strange riding under the low branches of a tree she dropped backwards flat on the horse s back with her feet on its shoulders then first looking round to make sure no one was watching she sat up straight again and pulled her dress to her knees with her legs on either side of the horse this was obviously easier for riding but not very ladylike gabriel was surprised and amused by her behaviour he waited until she returned from her aunt s hut and stepped out into the path in front of her i found a hat he said it s mine she said she put it on and smiled it flew away at one o clock this morning well yes i needed my hat this morning i had to ride to the hut in that field where there s a sick cow belonging to my aunt yes i know i saw you where she asked horrified riding all the way up the hill along the path said gabriel thinking of her unladylike position on the horse s back a deep blush spread from her head to her neck gabriel turned sympathetically away wondering when he dared look at her again when he turned back she had gone five mornings and evenings passed the young woman came regularly to take care of the sick cow but never spoke to gabriel he felt very sorry he had offended her so much by telling her he had seen her when she thought she was alone then one freezing night gabriel returned exhausted to his hut the warm air from the stove made him sleepy and he forgot to open one of the air holes before going to sleep the next thing he knew was that the girl with the lovely face was with him in the hut holding his head in her arms whatever is happening he asked only half conscious nothing now she answered but you could have died in this hut of yours yes i suppose i could said gabriel he was hoping he could stay there close to her for a long time he wanted to tell her so but he knew he could not express himself well so he stayed silent how did you find me he asked in the end oh i heard your dog scratching at the door so i came to see what the matter was i opened the door and found you unconscious it must have been the smoke from the stove i believe you saved my life miss i don t know your name there s no need to know it i probably won t see you again my name is gabriel oak mine isn t you sound very proud of your name well it s the only one i shall ever have i don t like mine i should think you ll soon get a new one well that s my business gabriel oak i m not very clever at talking miss but i want to thank you come give me your hand she hesitated then offered her hand he took it but held it for only a moment i m sorry he said i didn t mean to let your hand go so quickly you may have it again then here it is gabriel held it longer this time how soft it is even in winter not rough at all he said there that s long enough she said but without pulling it away but i suppose you re thinking you d like to kiss it you may if you want to i wasn t thinking any such thing said gabriel but oh no you won t she pulled her hand sharply away now discover my name she added laughing and left disaster for gabriel oak young farmer oak was in love he waited for the girl s regular visits to the sick cow just as impatiently as his dog waited to be fed he discovered that her name was bathsheba everdene and that she lived with her aunt mrs hurst his head was so full of her that he could think of nothing else i ll make her my wife he declared to himself or i ll never be able to concentrate on work again when she stopped coming to feed the sick cow he had to find a reason for visiting her so he took a young lamb whose mother had died and carried it in a basket across the fields to mrs hurst s house i ve brought a lamb for miss everdene he told bathshe ba s aunt girls usually like looking after lambs thank you mr oak replied mrs hurst but bathsheba is only a visitor here i don t know if she ll keep it to tell you the truth mrs hurst the lamb isn t my real reason for coming i want to ask miss everdene if she d like to be married really asked mrs hurst looking closely at him yes because if she would i d like to marry her do you know if she has any other young men courting her at the moment oh yes a lot of young men said mrs hurst you see farmer oak she s so handsome and so well educated too of course i haven t actually seen any of her young men but she must have at least ten or twelve that s unfortunate said farmer oak staring sadly at the floor i m just a very ordinary man and my only chance was being the first to ask to marry her well that was all i came for i d better go home now mrs hurst he had gone halfway across the first field when he heard a cry behind him he turned and saw a girl running after him it was bathsheba gabriel blushed farmer oak she called breathlessly i want to say my aunt made a mistake when she told you i had a lot of young men courting me in fact i haven t got any and i ve never had any i am glad to hear that said gabriel with a wide smile holding out his hand to take hers but she pulled her hand away quickly i have a nice comfortable little farm he added a little less confidently and when we are married i m sure i can work twice as hard as i do now and earn more he stretched out his arm towards her bathsheba moved rapidly behind a tree to avoid him but farmer oak she said in surprise i never said i was going to marry you well said gabriel disappointed to run after me like this and then say you don t want me i only wanted to explain that my aunt was wrong she answered eagerly anyway i had to run to catch up with you so i didn t have time to decide whetherl wanted to marry or not just think for a minute or two replied gabriel hopefully i ll wait a while miss everdene will you marry me do bathsheba i love you very much i ll try to think she answered give me time and she looked away from him at the distant hills i can make you happy he said to the back of her head you shall have a piano and i ll practise the flute to play with you in the evenings yes i d like that and at home by the fire whenever you look up there i ll be and whenever i look up there you ll be wait let me think she was silent for a while and then turned to him no she said i don t want to marry you it d be nice to have a wedding but having a husband well he d always be there as you say whenever i looked up there he d be of course he would it would be me that s the problem i wouldn t mind being a bride if i could be one without having a husband but as a woman can t be a bride alone i won t marry at least not yet what a silly thing for a girl to say cried gabriel and then he said softly but darling think again he moved round the tree to reach her why won t you have me because i don t love you she replied moving away but i love you and i m happy to be liked if that s all you feel for me he spoke more seriously than he had ever spoken before only one thing is certain in this life i shall love you and want you and keep on wanting you until i die his feelings were plain to see in his honest face and his large brown hands were trembling it seems wrong not to accept you when you feel so strongly she replied unhappily i wish i hadn t run after you but we wouldn t be happy together mr oak i m too independent i need a husband who can keep me in order and i m sure you wouldn t be able to do that gabriel looked hopelessly away and did not reply and mr oak she continued in a clear voice i m so poor that my aunt has to provide a home for me you re just starting your farming business it would be much more sensi ble for you to marry a woman with money then you could buy more sheep and improve your farm that s just what i d been thinking answered gabriel in surprise what common sense she had he thought admiringly well then why did you ask to marry me she said angrily i can t do what i think would be sensible i must do what my heart tells me he did not see the trap she had set for him now you ve confessed that marrying me wouldn t be sen sible mr oak do you think i ll marry you after that don t mistake my meaning like that he cried just because i m honest enough to tell you the truth i know you d be a good wife for me you speak like a lady everyone says so and your uncle at weatherbury has a large farm i ve heard may i visit you in the evenings or will you come for a walk with me on sundays you don t have to decide at once no no i cannot don t insist don t i don t love you so it would be foolish she said with a laugh no man likes to see his feelings laughed at so gabriel oak said turning away very well then i won t ask you again gabriel did not see bathsheba again and two days later he heard that she had left the area and was now in weatherbury a village twenty miles away her departure did not stop gabriel from loving her in fact he loved her even more deeply now that they were apart the next night before going to bed gabriel called his two dogs to come into the house for the night his old dog george obeyed the call but the younger one was missing gabriel was having difficulty training this young dog which although enthusiastic still did not understand a sheep dog s duties he did not worry about the dog s absence but went to bed very early in the morning he was woken by the sound of sheep bells ringing violently shepherds know every sound that sheep bells make and gabriel immediately realized that his sheep were running fast he jumped out of bed threw on his clothes and ran up norcombe hill to his fields near the chalk pit there were his fifty sheep with their lambs all safe in one field but in the other field the two hundred pregnant sheep had completely disappeared he noticed a broken gate and felt sure the sheep had gone through it there was no sign of them in the next field but ahead of him at the top of the hill he saw the young dog looking black against the morning sky it was standing quite still staring down into the chalk pit gabriel felt sick as he realized the horrible truth he hurried up the hill to the edge of the chalk pit and looked down into it in the deep pit lay his dead and dying sheep two hundred of them which would have produced two hundred more in the next few weeks the young untrained dog must have chased them up to the edge of the pit where they fell to their death his first feeling was pity for those gentle sheep and their unborn lambs then he thought of himself all his savings which he had worked so hard for in the last ten years had been spent on renting the farm now his hopes of being an independent farmer were destroyed he covered his face with his hands after a while he looked up thank god i m not married to bathsheba he thought what would she have done mar ried to a husband as poor as i shall be the young dog was shot the next day gabriel sold all his farm tools to pay what he owed for the sheep he was no longer a farmer just an ordinary man who owned the clothes he was wearing and nothing more now he had to find work where he could on other men s farms the fire two months later gabriel went to the great fair at casterbridge hoping to find a job as farm manager but when he realized by late afternoon that none of the farmers at casterbridge wanted a farm manager or even a shepherd he decided to try his luck at another fair the next day it was fifteen miles further away in a village the other side of weatherbury the name weatherbury reminded him of bathsheba and he wondered if she still lived there he set out on foot as it was getting dark and had already walked three or four miles when he saw a cart half full of hay by the side of the road that s a comfortable place to sleep he thought and he was so tired after his long disappointing day at the fair that when he climbed into the cart he fell asleep immediately a couple of hours later however he was woken by the movement of the cart it was being driven towards weather bury by two farm workers who had not noticed gabriel he listened to their conversation she s a handsome woman that s true said one but proud too and very vain that s what people say oh if she s vain billy smallbury i ll never be able to look at her i m such a shy man as you know said the other a single woman and vain and does she pay her farm workers well i don t know about that joseph poorgrass gabriel thought they could be talking about bathsheba except that the woman they were discussing seemed to be the mistress of a farm as the cart was now quite near weather bury gabriel jumped out unseen by the two men he climbed a gate into a field intending to sleep for the rest of the night under a hay rick but then he noticed an unusual light in the darkness about half a mile away something was on fire he hurried across the fields towards the fire soon in the rich orange light of the flames he could see a hay rick burning fiercely it was too late to save the rick so for a few minutes he stood and stared at the flames but when the smoke cleared for a moment he was horrified to see very close to the burn ing rick a whole row of wheat ricks these probably con tained most of the wheat produced on the farm that year and could catch fire at any moment as he rushed towards the wheat rick that was most in dan ger he saw he was not alone a crowd of farm workers had seen the fire and run into the field to help save the wheat but they were so confused they did not know what to do gabriel took control and gave orders get a large cloth he shouted put it over the wheat rick so the wind can t blow the flames from the hay rick on to it now you stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet the men hurried to obey him the flames prevented from burning the bottom and sides of the wheat rick began to attack its roof get me a ladder cried gabriel and a branch and some water he climbed up the wheat rick and sat on the top beating down the flames with the branch billy smallbury one of the men who had been in the cart climbed up with a bucket of water to throw water on gabriel and keep the flames off him the smoke was at its thickest at this corner of the rick but gabriel never stopped his work on the ground the villagers were doing what they could to stop the fire which was not much a little further away was a young woman who had just arrived on her horse witn her maid on foot they were watching the fire and discussing gabriel he s a fine young man ma am said liddy the maid and look at his clothes they re all burnt who does he work for asked the woman in a clear voice i don t know ma am nor do the others he s a stranger jan coggan called the woman to one of her workers do you think the wheat is safe now i think so yes ma am he answered if the fire had spread to this wheat rick all the other ricks would have caught fire too that brave young man up there on top of the rick is the one who s saved your wheat he does work hard said the young woman looking up at gabriel who had not noticed her i wish he worked for me as the ricks were no longer in danger gabriel started to climb down and at the bottom he met the maid i have a message from the farmer who wishes to thank you for all you ve done she said where is he asked gabriel suddenly aware of the chance of getting some work it isn t a he it s a she answered the girl a woman farmer asked gabriel yes and a rich one too said a villager who was standing near she inherited her uncle s farm when he died suddenly she has business in every bank in casterbridge she s over there wrapped in a cloak on her horse added the maid in the darkness gabriel could only see the shape of a woman sitting on a horse he walked over to her although his face was black from the smoke and his clothes were burnt by the fire he remembered to lift his hat politely and asked looking up at her do you want a shepherd ma am she let her cloak fall back from her head in surprise gabriel and his cold hearted darling bathsheba everdene stared at each other she did not speak he only repeated sadly do you want a shepherd ma am bathsheba turned away into the shadows to consider she was a little sorry for him but also glad that she had improved her position since they last met she realized she had almost forgotten his offer of marriage on norcombe hill yes she answered quietly blushing a little i do want a shepherd but he s just the right man ma am said one of the villagers that s right said a second and a third then will you men tell him to speak to the farm manager said bathsheba in a businesslike way as she rode off gabriel soon arranged the details of his employment with bathsheba s farm manager benjy pennyways and walked on to the village to find a place to live as he walked he thought of bathsheba how quickly the young girl he remembered had become the capable mistress of a farm when he passed the churchyard and the ancient trees around it he noticed that someone was standing behind one of the trees is this the right way to weatherbury asked gabriel oh yes straight on said a girl s voice low and sweet after a pause she added you re not a weatherbury man no i m the new shepherd just arrived only a shepherd you seem almost like a farmer to me only a shepherd repeated gabriel in a dull voice think ing of the disaster that had destroyed his hopes of being a farmer please don t tell anyone in the village that you ve seen me begged the girl i m rather poor and i don t want anyone to know about me her thin arms trembled in the cold i won t tell anyone said gabriel but you ought to be wearing a cloak on a night like this oh it doesn t matter please go on and leave me he hesitated perhaps you d accept this it s not much but it s all i have to spare he put a coin into her small hand and as he touched her wrist he noticed how quickly the blood was beating it was the same quick hard beat that he felt in his lambs when they were close to death what s the matter can t i help you he asked he felt a deep sadness in this thin weak creature no no don t tell anyone you ve seen me good night she stayed in the shadows and gabriel went on to weather bury fanny robin disappears the farm manager had advised gabriel to go straight to the malthouse in weatherbury to ask for somewhere to stay that was the place where the men of the village spent their evenings drinking beer and talking by the fire when gabriel entered the warm dark room some of bathsheba s workers recognized him come in shepherd you re welcome said one gabriel oak is my name neighbours the ancient maltster with his white hair and long white beard turned his old head stiffly towards gabriel gabriel oak of norcombe he said i knew your grandparents well my boy jacob and his young son billy know your family too his boy jacob was bald and toothless and young billy was about forty you must be very old maltster said gabriel politely to have such an old son as jacob here yes i ve lived for over a hundred years replied the little old man proudly sit down and drink with us shepherd the cup of warm beer passed round the circle of drinkers there was silence for a moment then gabriel turned the conversation to the matter closest to his heart what kind of mistress is miss everdene he asked we know almost nothing of her shepherd answered jan coggan a big cheerful man with a red face she only arrived here a few days ago when her uncle died but the everdenes are a good family to work for of course it s the farm manager who ll be giving us our orders ah said the maltster frowning benjy pennyways you can t trust him added jacob darkly soon afterwards gabriel left with jan coggan who had offered the shepherd a bed in his house the remaining men were just preparing to leave when suddenly a young man called laban tall rushed into the malthouse almost too excited to speak it s benjy pennyways he cried miss everdene s caught him stealing wheat from the barn she s sent him away and worse than that fanny robin you know miss everdene s youngest maid is missing the mistress wants us to look for her tomorrow and billy smallbury she wants you to go to casterbridge to see if you can find the young soldier who s been courting fanny that night the news spread fast round the village but did not reach gabriel whose dreams were only of bathsheba through the long slow hours of darkness he saw her lovely face and forgot that she did not love him the next morning bathsheba and her maid liddy were dust ing some books when a visitor arrived at the front door it was mr boldwood who had a large farm in weatherbury i can t see him like this liddy said bathsheba looking in horror at her dusty dress go down and tell him i m busy when liddy came back after mr boldwood had gone bathsheba asked what did he want liddy and who is he exactly he just wanted to ask if fanny had been found miss you know as she had no family or friends he was kind enough to pay for her to go to school and found her a job here with your uncle he s your neighbour his farm is next to yours is he married and how old is he he isn t married he s abeut forty very handsome and rich all the girls in the area have tried to persuade him to marry but he just doesn t seem interested in women have you ever had an offer of marriage miss yes i have liddy answered bathsheba after a pause thinking of gabriel but he wasn t quite good enough for me oh how nice to be able to refuse when most of us are glad to accept the first offer and did you love him miss oh no but i rather liked him in the afternoon bathsheba called her workers together and spoke to them in the old hall of the farmhouse men i want to tell you that i m not going to employ a new farm manager i shall manage the farm myself there were gasps of surprise from the men she gave her orders for the next week s farm work and then turned to one of the men billy smallbury what have you discovered about fanny robin i think she s run away with her young man ma am the soldiers have left casterbridge and i suppose she s gone with them well perhaps we ll discover more later one of you can go and tell mr boldwood what billy says now men i hope i can trust you all to do your work well for me goodnight later that evening in a town many miles north of weather bury a small white shape could be seen walking slowly along a path beside a large building it was a dull snowy night with heavy grey clouds hanging low in the sky the kind of night when hopes are destroyed and love is lost one two three four five the white shape was counting windows in the building then it began to throw small stones covered in snow at the fifth window at last the window opened and a man called out who s there is that sergeant troy asked a girl s voice yes answered the man who are you oh frank don t you know me cried the girl desperately i m your i m fanny robin fanny gasped the man in surprise how did you get here i walked most of the way from weatherbury but frank are you glad to see me frank when will it be what are you talking about you know you promised when shall we be married frank oh i see well you need proper clothes we must inform the vicar it takes time i didn t expect you to come so soon oh frank i love you so and you said you d marry me don t cry now it s foolish if i said so of course i will i ll come and see you tomorrow to decide the details oh yes frank do i m staying at mrs twill s in north street come tomorrow frank goodnight frank bathsheba sends a valentine when bathsheba first appeared at the weekly caster bridge market where farmers bought and sold their wheat and animals she caused a sensation men s heads turned to look at her the only woman there like any woman she was happy to be admired but she was also determined to sell her wheat at a good price and to do business with the other farmers like a man there was one farmer however who did not seem to notice her and this annoyed her a little it was mr boldwood one sunday afternoon on the thirteenth of february bathsheba and liddy were in the sitting room together it was a dull cold day and they were both very bored have you ever tried to discover who you re going to marry miss asked liddy with a bible and a key i don t believe in such foolish games liddy well some people believe it works all right let s try it said bathsheba suddenly jumping up from her seat together they opened the big family bible and put a key on a page now you think of someone you could marry miss said liddy then read aloud the words on that page and if the bible moves perhaps you ll marry him bathsheba read the words holding the bible as they watched the bible turned in her hands and bathsheba blushed who were you thinking of asked liddy curiously i m not going to tell you answered her mistress by the way did you notice mr boldwood in church this morning asked liddy making it very clear who she was thinking of he didn t turn his head once to look at you why should he replied bathsheba annoyed i didn t ask him to look at me oh no but everybody else in church was looking at you bathsheba did not reply to this after a few minutes she said oh i nearly forgot the valentine card i bought yester day a valentine who s it for miss farmer boldwood no of course not it s for one of the village children that sweet little boy of jan coggan s i ll write the address on the envelope now and we ll post it today what fun it would be to send it to that silly old bold wood laughed liddy bathsheba paused to consider it was certainly a little de pressing that the wealthiest and most important man in the area did not seem to admire her as all the other men did we ll throw a coin to decide she said lightly no we shouldn t play with money on a sunday i know we ll throw this book if it comes down open i ll send the valentine to jan s son if it comes down shut i ll send it to boldwood the little book went up in the air and came down shut bathsheba immediately picked up her pen and wrote bold wood s address on the envelope now we need a seal she said look for an interesting one liddy ah let s use this one i can t remember what it says but i know it s funny when she had sealed the enve lope bathsheba looked closely at the words left by the seal marry me just right she cried that would make even a vicar laugh and so the valentine was sent not for love but as a joke bathsheba had no idea of the effect it would have it arrived at mr boldwood s house on the morning of st valentine s day th february he was puzzled but strangely excited by it he had never received one before and all day he thought about it who could the woman be who admired him so much that she sent him a valentine he kept on looking at it until the words on the large red seal danced in front of his tired eyes and he could no longer read them but he knew what they said marry me the valentine had destroyed the peaceful routine of bold wood s life that night he dreamed of the unknown woman and when he woke up very early the first thing he saw was the valentine with its message in red on the table by his bed marry me he repeated to himself he was too restless to sleep any more so he went out for a walk he watched the sun rise over the snowy fields and on his way home he met the postman who handed him a letter boldwood took it quickly and opened it thinking it could be from the sender of the valentine i don t think it s for you sir said the postman i think it s for your shepherd boldwood looked at the address on the envelope to the new shepherd weatherbury farm near casterbridge oh what a mistake it isn t mine or my shepherd s it must be for miss everdene s shepherd his name is gabriel oak at that moment he noticed a figure in a distant field ah there he is now boldwood added i ll take the let ter to him myself the shepherd started walking towards the malthouse and boldwood followed him holding the letter fanny s mistake at the malthouse the men were discussing bathsheba how s she getting on without a farm manager the old maltster asked the younger men she can t manage the farm alone replied jacob and she won t listen to our advice proud she is i ve often said it you have jacob you have that s true agreed little joseph poorgrass but she s intelligent said billy smallbury and must have some common sense it seems her old uncle s furniture wasn t good enough for her said the maltster i hear she s bought new beds chairs and a piano if she s a farmer why does she want a piano just then they heard a heavy footstep outside and a voice called neighbours can i bring a few lambs in there of course shepherd they all replied gabriel appeared in the doorway his cheeks red and his healthy face shining on his shoulders were four half dead lambs which he put down carefully close to the fire i haven t got a shepherd s hut here as i used to have at norcombe he explained these new lambs would die if i couldn t keep them warm for a while it s very kind of you maltster to let me bring them in here we ve been talking of the mistress and her strange behaviour shepherd said the maltster what have you been saying about her asked gabriel sharply turning to the others i suppose you ve been speaking against her he added angrily to joseph poorgrass no no not a word said joseph trembling and blushing with terror well look here neighbours gabriel although normally one of the quietest and most gentle men on earth had sudden ly become aggressive the first man i hear saying anything bad about our mistress will receive this in his face and he banged his great heavy hand down on the maltster s table now don t get so angry shepherd and sit down said jacob we hear you re a very clever man shepherd added joseph poorgrass from behind the maltster s bed where he had been hiding we all wish we were as clever as you don t we neighbours there was general agreement i think mistress ought to have made you her farm manager you re so suitable for the job continued joseph he could see that gabriel was no longer angry i don t mind confessing i was hoping to be her farm man ager said gabriel in his honest way but miss everdene can do as she likes and she s chosen to manage her own farm and keep me as an ordinary shepherd only he sounded rather depressed and looked sadly into the fire before anyone could reply the door opened and mr bold wood came in he greeted them all and handed the letter to gabriel i opened this by mistake oak he said but it must be for you i m sorry oh it doesn t matter at all answered gabriel who had no secrets from anyone he read this letter dear friend i don t know your name but i want to thank you for your kindness to me on the night i left weatherbury i m also returning the money you gave me i m happy to say i m going to marry the young man who has been courting me sergeant troy as he is a nobleman s son i know he wouldn t like me to accept a gift from anyone please don t tell anyone about my marriage we intend to surprise weatherbury by arriuing there as husband and wife very soon thank you again fanny robin you d better read it mr boldwood said gabriel it s from fanny robin she wants to keep this a secret but i know you re interested in her i met her on my way to weatherbury but i didn t know then who she was when mr boldwood had finished reading the letter he looked very serious poor fanny he said i don t think this sergeant troy will ever marry her he s clever and handsome but he can t be trusted what a silly girl fanny is i m very sorry to hear that said gabriel by the way oak said mr boldwood quietly as he and the shepherd left the malthouse together could you tell me whose writing this is he showed gabriel the envelope containing the valentine gabriel looked at it and said simply miss everdene s then he realized that bathsheba must have written to mr boldwood without signing her name and he looked puzzled at the farmer mr boldwood replied rather too quickly to gabriel s unspo ken question it s quite normal to try to discover who has written the valentine that s the fun of it there was no fun at all in his manner goodbye oak he added and walked slowly back to his empty house a few days later in the town north of weatherbury where the soldiers were staying a wedding was arranged as the church clock in the square struck half past eleven a handsome young soldier marched into the church and spoke to the vicar then he stood still in the centre of the church waiting for his bride the church was full of the women and girls who had at tended the morning service and had decided to wait to see the wedding they watched the young man s straight back whis pering among themselves the soldier waited without moving a muscle the church clock struck a quarter to twelve and still the bride did not come the whispers stopped and there was silence the young man stood as stiff and straight as the church columns around him there was a little quiet laughter from some of the women but soon they were silent again waiting for the end as the church clock struck twelve they listened to the heavy notes ringing out from the church tower the vicar left his position near the soldier and disappeared into a back room every woman in the church was waiting to see the young man s face and he knew it at last he turned and marched bravely back the way he had come through the rows of smiling women when he got outside and crossed the square he met a girl hurrying towards the church when she saw him the anxiety on her face changed to terror well he said staring coldly at her oh frank i made a mistake i thought it was the other church he one near the market and i waited there till a quarter to twelve and then i realized my mistake but it doesn t matter because we can just as easily get married tomorrow you re a fool to play games with me he replied angrily so shall we get married tomorrow frank she asked not understanding how seriously she had offended him tomorrow he repeated and laughed i don t want another experience like that for a while i can promise you but frank she begged in a trembling voice it wasn t such a terrible mistake now dear frank when will our wedding be ah when god knows he said and turning away from her walked rapidly away farmer boldwood proposes marriage on saturday at casterbridge market boldwood saw the woman who was disturbing his dreams for the first time he turned his head and looked at her it was in fact the first time in his life that he had looked at any woman up to now he had considered women to be distant almost foreign creatures who had nothing to do with him now he saw bathsheba s hair and every detail of her face he noticed her figure her dress and even her feet she seemed very beauti ful to him and his heart began to move within him and this woman this lovely young woman has asked me to marry her he thought as he was watching bathsheba selling wheat to another farmer he was filled with jealousy all this time bathsheba was aware of his eyes on her at last she had made him look at her but she would have pre ferred him to admire her from the beginning without the encouragement of her valentine she felt sorry she had disturbed the usual calmness of a man she respected but considered she could not apologize to him without either offending or encour aging him mr boldwood did not try to speak to her and returned home to his farm he was a man of strong feelings which normally lay hidden deep inside him because he was serious and did not joke with his neighbours people thought he was cold but when he loved or hated it was with his whole heart if bathsheba had known how strong the feelings of this dark and silent figure were she would have blamed herself terribly for her thoughtlessness but nobody guessed what lay behind his calm appearance a few days later mr boldwood was looking at bathsheba s fields which were next to his own when he saw her helping gabriel oak with the sheep to boldwood bathsheba shone like the moon on a dark night his heart which had never been touched before was filled completely with his love for her he decided to go and speak to her as he stopped at the gate of the field bathsheba looked up and noticed him gabriel was watching her face and saw her blush he immediately thought of the envelope with the valentine that boldwood had shown him and suspected bathsheba of encouraging the farmer to fall in love with her boldwood realized they had noticed him and suddenly felt unsure of himself he did not know enough about women to discover from bathsheba s manner whether she wanted to see him or not and so he did not enter the field but walked on past the gate bathsheba however knew that he had come to see her and felt extremely guilty she promised herself never again to disturb the peace of this man s life unfortunately her promise was made too late as such promises often are it was not until the end of may that boldwood was brave enough to declare his love he went to bathsheba s house where the maids told him their mistress was watching the sheep washing every spring the sheep were washed in a spe cial pool to keep their wool clean and to get rid of insects on their skin boldwood walked across the fields to the pool where he found the farm workers busily washing the sheep bathsheba was standing near them and saw boldwood coming towards her she moved away walking beside the river but she could hear footsteps behind her in the grass and felt love all around her like perfume in the air boldwood caught up with her miss everdene he said quietly she trembled turned and said good morning she had guessed the truth from the way he spoke those two words i feel almost too much to think he said simply my life does not belong to me any more miss everdene but to you i ve come to propose marriage to you bathsheba tried not to show any expression on her face i m now forty one he continued i ve never married or thought i ever would marry but we all change and i changed when i saw you more than anything else i want you as my wife i think mr boldwood that although i respect you very much i don t feel enough for you to accept your proposal but my life is worthless without you he cried calm no longer i want you to let me say i love you again and again bathsheba remained silent i think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what i have to say he added bathsheba was about to ask why he should think that when she remembered the valentine after all it was quite natural for him to think she admired him i wish i could court you with beautiful words the farmer went on but i can only say i love you madly and want you for my wife i wouldn t have proposed if you hadn t allowed me to hope mr boldwood this is difficult for me i m afraid i can t marry you i m not in love with you i should never have sent that valentine forgive me it was a thoughtless thing to do no no don t say it was thoughtless say it was the beginning of a feeling that you would like me just consider whether you can accept me as a husband i know i m too old for you but believe me i ll take more care of you than a younger man would you ll have nothing to worry about you ll have everything you want god only knows how much you mean to me bathsheba s young heart was full of pity for this sensitive man who had spoken so simply and honestly don t say it don t you feel so much and i feel nothing she replied don t discuss it any more i can t think oh i ve given you such pain tell me that you don t refuse completely give me some hope may i ask you again may i think of you yes i suppose so may i hope you will accept my proposal next time no don t hope i must go now give me time to think yes i ll give you time he answered gratefully thank you i m happier now no please don t be happier mr boldwood if happiness only comes from my agreeing i must think i ll wait he agreed they turned away from each other and returned to their separate houses bathsheba s sheep in danger because bathsheba was not at all in love with farmer boldwood she was able to consider his proposal of marriage calmly it was an offer which many women of good family in the area would have been delighted to accept he was serious respectable and rich if she had wanted a husband she could not have found a good reason for refusing to marry him but she was still enjoying her new position as mistress of a farm and house and although she respected and liked him she did not want to marry him however she was honest enough to feel that as she had begun the courting by sending him the valentine she ought not to refuse him now there was only one person whose opinion she trusted more than her own and that person was gabriel oak so the next day she decided to ask his advice she found him with jan coggan sharpening the shears which would be used to shear the sheep jan go and help joseph with the horses she ordered i ll help you gabriel i want to talk to you the shears were sharpened on a stone which was turned by a wheel which was itself turned by a handle bathsheba could not manage the handle so she held the shears while gabriel turned the handle you aren t holding them right miss he told her let me show you how he let go of the handle and put his large hands round hers to hold the shears like that he said continuing to hold her hands for a peculiarly long time that s enough said bathsheba i don t want my hands held turn the handle they went on sharpening the shears gabriel what do the men think about me and mr bold wood they say you ll marry him before the end of the year miss what a foolish thing to say i want you to contradict it gabriel well bathsheba said gabriel staring at her in surprise miss everdene you mean she said well if mr boldwood really asked you to marry him i m not going to contradict that just to please you i said i wanted you just to say it wasn t true that i was going to marry him she said less confidently i can say that if you wish miss everdene i could also give my opinion of the way you ve behaved he continued with his work bathsheba knew that he would always give his honest opinion even if she asked him whether she should marry another man and there was nobody else she could trust well what is your opinion of my behaviour she asked no good respectable woman would behave like that he replied you should never have sent him that valentine bathsheba blushed angrily luckily i don t care about your opinion why do you think i m not good or respectable i wonder because i didn t agree to marry you perhaps not at all said gabriel quietly i ve long ago stopped thinking about that or wishing it i suppose she said expecting him to protest that he still loved her or wishing it repeated gabriel calmly bathsheba would not have minded being spoken to angrily by gabriel for her thoughtlessness if only he had told her he loved her but his cold words of blame annoyed her greatly i cannot allow any man to accuse me of bad behaviour she cried so you will leave the farm at the end of the week all right i will said gabriel calmly in fact i would rather go at once go at once then she replied angrily don t let me see your face any more very well miss everdene and so be took his shears and walked quietly away it was only twenty four hours after gabriel had left the farm that three men came running to report a disaster to bathsheba sixty of your sheep said joseph poorgrass breathless have broken through throgh the gate said billy also breathless and got into a field of young clover said laban tall they re eating the clover and they re all swollen up they ll all die if someone doesn t do something oh you fools cried bathsheba go straight to the field and get them out she rushed towards the clover field followed by the men her sheep were all lying down their stomachs badly swollen joseph billy and laban carried the sheep back into their own field where the poor creatures lay helplessly without moving oh what can i do what can i do cried bathsheba there s only one way of saving them said laban soemeone must make a hole in the sheep s side explained billy with a special tool then the air comes out and the sheep will survive can you do it can i do it she asked wildly no ma am if it isn t done very carefully the sheep will die most shepherds can t even do it only one man in the area can do it said joseph who is he let s get him said his mistress it s gabriel oak ah he s a clever man replied joseph that s right he certainly is agreed the other two how dare you say his name to me she said angrily what about farmer boldwood perhaps he can do it no ma am answered laban when his sheep ate some clover the other day and were swollen just like these he sent for cabriel at once and gabriel saved their lives i don t care don t just stand there go and find someone cried bathsheba the men ran off without any clear idea where they were going and bathsheba was left alone with her dying sheep never will i send for him never she promised herself one of the sheep jumped high in the air fell heavily and did not move it was dead bathsheba knew she must swallow her pride and called to laban who was waiting at the gate take a horse and go and find gabriel she ordered give him a message from me that he must return at once bathsheba and her men waited miserably in the field several more sheep jumped wildly into the air their stomachs horribly swollen and their muscles stiff then died at last a rider could be seen across the fields but it was not gabriel it was laban he says he won t come unless you ask him politely laban reported to bathsheba what said the young woman opening her eyes wide joseph poorgrass hid behind a tree in case she became violent how dare he answer me like that another sheep fell dead the men looked very serious and did not offer their opinion bathsheba s eyes filled with tears and she did not try to hide her anger and her injured pride don t cry about it miss suggested billy sympathetically why not ask gabriel in a gentler way i m sure he ll come then oh he s cruel to me said bathsheba drying her eyes but i ll beg him yes i ll have to she wrote a few words quickly on a piece of paper and at the last moment added at the bottom gabriel do not desert me she blushed a little as she wrote this and gave the letter to laban who rode off again to find gabriel when gabriel arrived bathsheba knew from his expression which words in her note had made him come he went straight to work on the swollen sheep and managed to save almost all of them when he had finished bathsheba came to speak to him gabriel will you stay on with me she asked smiling i will said gabriel and she smiled at him again a few days later the sheep shearing began the sheep were shorn every year at the beginning of june and their wool was sold the shearing was always done in the great barn which had stood on the farm for four centuries today the sunshine poured in on the shearers bathsheba was watching them care fully to make sure that the sheep were not injured and that all the wool was cut off gabriel was the most experienced shearer he loved being watched by bathsheba and felt warm with pride when she congratulated him on his speed but he was not happy for long farmer boldwood arrived at the door of the barn and spoke to bathsheba they stepped outside into the bright sunlight to carry on their conversation gabriel could not hear what they were saying but noticed that bathsheba was blushing he continued shearing feeling sud denly very sad bathsheba went back to the house and returned a short while later in her new green riding dress she and boldwood were obviously going for a ride together as gabriel s concentration was broken for a moment his shears cut the sheep s skin bathsheba at the door of the barn noticed the animal jump and saw the blood oh gabriel she said be more careful gabriel knew she was aware that she herself had indirectly caused the poor sheep s wound but he bravely hid his hurt feelings and watched boldwood and bathsheba ride away feeling as sure as the other workers that the couple would soon be married bathsheba meets a handsome soldier farmers always gave a special supper to the sheep shearers when they had finished their work this year bathsheba had ordered her maids to put a long table in the garden with the top end of the table just inside the house the farm workers took their seats and she sat at the top of the table so that she was with them but a little apart there was an empty place at the bottom of the table at first she asked gabriel to sit there but just then mr boldwood arrived apologizing for his lateness gabriel said bathsheba will you move again please and let mr boldwood sit there gabriel moved away in silence to another seat they all ate and drank and celebrated the end of the sheep shearing by singing their favourite songs mr boldwood seemed unusually cheerful and at the end of the meal he left his seat and went to join bathsheba at her end of the table just inside the sitting room it was growing dark but gabriel and the other men could not avoid noticing how boldwood looked at her it was clear that the middle aged farmer was deeply in love after a while bathsheba said goodnight to her farm workers and closed the sitting room door and windows now she and boldwood were alone kneeling in front of her he took her hands tell me tell me what you ve decided he begged i ll try to love you she answered in a trembling voice and if you think i ll make a good wife i ll agree to marry you but mr boldwood any woman would hesitate before deciding on something as important as marriage could you wait a few weeks until i m sure i ll be away on business for five or six weeks anyway do you really think that by that time you will i feel almost sure that when you come back at harvest time i ll be able to promise to marry you but remember i can t promise yet i don t ask for anything more i can wait goodnight miss everdene and he left her bathsheba now realized how thoughtlessly she had behaved towards him and understood how deeply he loved her she was very sorry for her mistake and was therefore punishing herself by agreeing to marry him that evening she went round the farm as usual lighting her lamp whenever necessary to check that all the animals were safe on her way back she was walking along the narrow public path which led to her house it was very dark there among the trees and she was a little surprised to hear some footsteps coming towards her it was unfortunate that she would meet the traveller at the darkest point of the path as she was about to pass the dark shape something seemed to attach her skirt to the ground and she had to stop what s happened have i hurt you friend a man asked no said bathsheba trying to pull her skirt away ah you re a lady the spur on my boot has got tied up with your dress have you got a lamp i ll light it for you the light from the lamp shone suddenly on a handsome young man in a bright red and gold army uniform he looked admiringly at bathsheba thank you for letting me see such a beautiful face he said i didn t want to show it to you she said coldly blushing please undo your spur quickly he bent down to pull rather lazily at his boots you are making it even worse she accused him angrily to keep me here longer oh no surely not smiled the soldier don t be angry i was doing it so that i could have the pleasure of apologizing to such a lovely woman bathsheba had no idea what to say she wondered whether to escape by pulling the material away but did not want to tear her best dress i ve seen many women in my life continued the young man staring into her face but i ve never seen a woman as beautiful as you i don t care if you re offended that s the truth who are you then if you don t care who you offend people know me in weatherbury my name s sergeant troy ah you see your skirt s free now i wish you and i had been tied together for ever she pulled her dress quickly away from his spurs and ran up the path and into her house the next day she discovered from liddy that sergeant troy s supposed father was a doctor but people said his real father was a nobleman he had been brought up in weatherbury and was well known as a young soldier with a great interest in girls bathsheba could not remain angry for long with someone who admired her as much as he obviously did it was unfortunate that boldwood when courting her had forgotten to tell her even once that she was beautiful sergeant troy was certainly an unusual man he lived only in the present caring nothing for the past or the future because he never expected anything he was never disappoint ed to men he usually told the truth but to women never he was intelligent and well educated and proud of his success with women a week or two after the sheep shearing bathsheba was in the hayfields where her workers were cutting the hay she was surprised to see a bright red figure appear from behind a cart sergeant troy had come to help on the farm she blushed as the young soldier came to speak to her miss everdene he said i didn t realize it was the queen of casterbridge market i was speaking to the other night i apologize for expressing my feelings so strongly to you then of course i m not a stranger here i often helped your uncle on the farm and now i m helping you i suppose i must thank you for that replied the queen of casterbridge market rather ungratefully you re cross because i was honest when i spoke to you that night but i couldn t look at you and say you aren t beautiful you are pretending sergeant troy said bathsheba laughing in spite of herself at his clever way of talking no miss everdene you must let me say how lovely you are what s wrong with that it s wrong because it isn t true she said hesitating but you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are don t you well no that is i ve heard liddy say they do but she paused she had never intended to become involved in this kind of conversation with the soldier but somehow he had trapped her into replying thank you for helping the men with the hay she continued but please don t speak to me again oh miss bathsheba that s too hard i won t be here long i m going back to the army in a month but you don t really care about a word from me do you i do miss everdene perhaps you think it s foolish of me to want just a good morning but you have never loved a beautiful woman like yourself as i do but you only saw me the other night i don t believe you could fall in love so fast i won t listen to you any more i wish i knew what time it was i ve spent too much time with you haven t you got a watch miss i ll give you one and he handed her a heavy gold watch that watch belonged to a nobleman my father and is all the inheritance i have but sergeant troy i can t take this it s your father s and so valuable said bathsheba horrified i loved my father true but i love you more the young man was not pretending now as he looked at bathsheba s beautiful excited face can it be true that you love me you have seen so little of me please take it back wll then i ll take it he said because it s all i have to prove that i come of good family but will you speak to me while i m in weatherbury will you let me work in your fields yes or no i don t know oh why did you come and disturb me like this perhaps in setting a trap i ve caught myself such things sometimes happen goodbye miss everdene blushing and almost crying bathsheba hurried home whis pering to herself oh what have i done what does it mean i wish i knew how much of what he says is true bathsheba in love once or twice during the next few days bathsheba saw troy working in her hayflelds he behaved in a pleasant friendly manner towards her and she began to lose her fear of him cutting your hay is harder work than sword practice he told her one day a smile lighting up his handsome face is it i ve never seen sword practice she answered ah would you like to asked troy bathsheba hesitated she had heard wonderful stories from people who had watched soldiers practising stories of shining metal flashing through the air i would like to see it very much well i ll show you i can get a sword by this evening will you and he bent over her whispering in her ear oh no said bathsheba blushing i couldn t surely you could nobody would know well if i came liddy would have to come with me i don t see why you want to bring her troy said coldly well then i won t bring her and i ll come but only for a very short time so at eight o clock that evening bathsheba found herself in spite of her doubts climbing the hill near her house and go ing down the other side now she was in what seemed like a natural theatre a deep round hollow in the ground it was completely hidden from her house and the path this was the place where troy had asked her to meet him and troy in his bright red uniform was there now he said producing his sword which flashed in the evening sunlight let me show you one two three four like this a sword can kill a man in a second bathsheba saw a kind of rainbow in the air and gasped how cruel and murderous she cried yes now i ll pretend to fight you you are my enemy but the only difference from a real fight is that i ll miss you each time stand in front of me and don t move bathsheba was beginning to enjoy this i ll just test you first added troy to see whether you re brave enough the sword flashed in the air from her left to right side it seemed to go through her body but there it was again in troy s hand perfectly clean and free from blood oh she cried frightened have you killed me no yon haven t how did you do it i haven t touched you said troy quietly now you aren t afraid are you i promise i won t hurt you or even touch you i don t think i m afraid is the sword very sharp oh no just stand very still now in a second bathsheba could no longer see the sky or the ground the shining weapon flashed above around and in front of her catching light from the low sun and whistling as it rushed through the air never had sergeant troy managed his sword better than today your hair is a little untidy he said allow me and before she could move or speak a curl dropped to the ground you are very brave for a woman he congratulated her it was because i didn t expect it now i m afraid of you i am really this time i won t even touch your hair i m going to kill that insect on your dress stand still not daring to tremble she saw the point of his sword coming towards her heart and sure that this time she would die closed her eyes but when she opened them she saw the insect dead on the point of the sword it s magic she cried and how could you cut off one of my curls with a sword that isn t sharp it s sharper than any knife he said i had to lie to you about that to give you the confidence to stand still bathsheba s feelings were almost too much for her to control and she sat down suddenly in the grass i could have died she whispered you were perfectly safe troy told her my sword never makes a mistake i must leave you now i ll keep this to re mind me of you he bent to pick up the curl of hair which he put carefully in his pocket next to his heart she was not strong enough to say or do anything he came closer bent again and a minute later his red coat disappeared through the grass bathsheba blushed guiltily and tears rolled down her face in that minute troy had kissed her on the lips determined independent women often show their weakness when they fall in love and bathsheba had very little experi ence of the world or of men it was as difficult for her to see troy s bad qualities which he kept carefully hidden as to ad mire gabriel oak s good ones which were not all obvious at first sight one evening a few days later gabriel went to find his mis tress he knew that she was falling in love and had decided to warn her of the mistake she was making he found her walking along a path through the fields i was worried about your walking alone miss he said it s rather late and there are some bad men in the area he was hoping to introduce troy s name as one of the bad men i never meet any said bathsheba lightly gabriel tried again farmer boldwood will be taking care of you in future of course what do you mean gabriel well when you and he are married miss as everybody expects you ve let him court you after all everybody is wrong gabriel i didn t promise him any thing i respect him but i won t marry him i wish you had never met that young sergeant troy miss be said sadly he s not good enough for you how dare you say that he s of good family and well educated replied bathsheba angrily he can t be trusted miss don t trust him i beg you he s as good as anybody in the village he goes to church regularly he told me so himself i m afraid nobody has ever seen him in church i certainly haven t cabriel s heart ached when he saw how completely bathsheba trusted the soldier that s because he enters by the old tower door and sits at the back where he can t be seen she replied eagerly you know mistress said gabriel in a deep voice full of sadness that i love you and shall love you for ever i accept that i can t marry you now that i m poor but bathsheba dear mistress think of your position be careful of your behaviour towards this soldier mr boldwood is sixteen years older than you consider how well he would lood after you leave my farm cabriel said bathsheba her face white with anger you can t speak like that to me your mistress don t be foolish you ve already sent me away once how would you manage without me no although i d like to have my own farm i ll stay with you and you know why well i suppose you can stay if you wish will you leave me here now please i ask not as your mistress but as a woman of course miss everdene said gabriel gently he was a little surprised by her request as it was getting dark and they were on a lonely hill some way from her house as she moved away from him the reason became clear the figure of a soldier appeared on the hill and came to meet bathsheba gabriel turned away and walked sadly home on his way he passed the church where he looked closely at the old tower door it was covered with climbing plants and clearly had not been used for years half an hour later bathsheba arrived home with troy s words of love still in her ears he had kissed her a second time wild and feverish with excitement she sat down imme diately to write to boldwood to inform him that she could not marry him the letter would reach him on his business trip she was so enger to send the letter at once that she called liddy to post it liddy tell me she said urgently when her maid entered the room promise me that sergeant troy isn t a bad man promise me that he doesn t chase girls as people say but miss how can i say he doesn t if he don t be so cruel liddy say you don t believe he s had i don t know what to say miss said liddy beginning to cry i ll make you angry whatever i say oh how weak i am how i wish i d never seen him you see how much i love him liddy don t tell anyone my secret liddy i ll keep your secret miss said liddy gently farmer boldwood becomes desperate liddy was allowed a week s holiday to visit her sister who lived a few miles away to avoid seeing mr bold wood bathsheba herself arranged to visit liddy at her sister s home for a day or two she left her cleaning woman maryann in charge of the house and set out on foot one evening she had walked only about two miles when she saw coming towards her the one man who she did not wish to see his changed appearance showed her that he had received her letter oh is it you mr boldwood she said with a guilty blush you know how i feel about you he said slowly a love as strong as death a letter cannot change that feeling don t speak of it she whispered then i have nothing to say your letter was excellently clear we are not going to marry bathsheba said confusedly good evening and walked on a little further but boldwood could not let her go bathsheba darling is it really final indeed it is oh bathsheba have pity on me i am mad with love for you don t refuse me now you turned to me and encour aged me before i ever thought of you what you call encouragement was a childish joke i m deeply sorry i sent the valentine must you go on reminding me of it i love you too much to blame you for it bathsheba you are the first woman i have ever loved how nearly you promised to marry me what has happened to your kindness towards me bathsheba looked him quietly and openly in the face and said mr boldwood i promised you nothing how can you be so heartless if i had known how awfully bitter this love would be i d have avoided you and been deaf to you i tell you all this but what do you care bathsheba s control was breaking she shook her head desperately as the man s angry words rained down on her forgive me sir i can t love as you can that s not a good reason miss everdene you aren t the cold woman you re pretending to be you re hiding the fact that you ve a burning heart like mine your love is given to another man he knows she thought he knows about frank why didn t troy leave my darling alone he continued fiercely tell me honestly if you hadn t met him would you have accepted my proposal she delayed her answer but she was too honest to stay silent yes she whispered in my absence he stole my most valuable prize from me now i ve lost my respect and my good name and everybody laughs at me marry him go on marry him i would have died for you but you have given yourself to a worthless man perhaps he has even kissed you tell me he hasn t she was frightened of boldwood s anger but she answered bravely he has i m not ashamed to speak the truth i would have given a fortune to touch your hand cried boldwood wildly but you have let a man like that kiss you one day he ll be sorry and realize the pain he s caused me be kind to him sir she cried miserably because i love him so much boldwood was no longer listening to her i ll punish him sweet bathsheba forgive me i ve been blaming you but it s his fault he stole your dear heart away with his lies when i find him i ll fight him keep him away from me bathsbeba the desperate man stood still for a moment then turned and left her bathsheba walked up and down crying and whispering to herself then threw herself down by the road exhausted she knew that troy was away in bath at the moment but would be returning to weatherbury very soon if he came to visit her and boldwood saw him a fierce argu ment would be the result and troy could be hurt but per haps gabriel and boldwood were right and she should not see him again if she could only see troy now he would help her to decide she jumped to her feet and hurried back along the road to weatherbury that night maryann the only person sleeping in bathsheba s house was woken by strange noises in the field where the horses were kept she looked out of her bedroom window just in time to see a dark figure leading bathsheba s horse and cart out of the field she ran to jan coggan s house for help jan and gabriel immediately rode after the thief after riding for some time in the dark they finally caught up with the cart at a toll gate keep the gate closed shouted gabriel to the gatekeeper that man s stolen the horse and cart what man asked the gatekeeper puzzled gabriel looked closely at the driver of the cart and saw a woman bathsheba she turned her face away from the light when she heard his voice but jan coggan had also recognized her she was quick to hide her surprise but not her annoyance well gabriel she asked coldly where are you going we thought someone had stolen the horse and cart how foolish of you some important business made me change my plans i m on my way to bath i may visit liddy at her sister s later i arrived home during the night so i didn t wake maryann up i just took the horse and cart myself thank you for taking all this trouble but it wasn t necessary the gatekeeper opened the gate and she passed through coggan and gabriel turned their horses and rode slowly home gabriel said i think we ll keep this strange trip of hers to bath a secret jan and jan agreed so at first the people of weatherbury had no idea where she had gone she stayed away for two weeks and there were reports that she had been seen in bath with sergeant troy gabriel knew in his heart that this must be true he worked as hard as ever on her farm but all the time there was a deep ache inside him bathsheba makes her choice on the same day that bathsheba arrived home mr boldwood went to apologize to her for speaking so violently the last time he had seen her he knew nothing of her trip to bath and supposed she had only been to visit liddy but at her door he was told he could not see her and he realized she had not forgiven him on his way home through weatherbury he saw the coach from bath it stopped at the usual place and a soldier in a red and gold uniform jumped down sergeant troy picked up his bag and was about to take the road to bathsheba s house when boldwood stepped forward sergeant troy i am william boldwood indeed said troy showing little interest i want to speak to you about two women troy saw the heavy stick boldwood was holding and real ized how determined he was he decided it was worth being polite i ll listen with pleasure but do speak quietly well then i ve heard about your relationship with fanny robin and i think you ought to marry her i suppose i ought indeed i want to but i cannot why can t you troy was going to reply immediately but he stopped him self i am too poor he said looking quickly at boldwood to see if the farmer believed him boldwood did not notice the look i don t want to talk about right or wrong i just want to discuss business with you i was engaged to miss everdene when you came and not engaged said troy more or less engaged insisted boldwood if you hadn t come she would certainly have accepted my proposal by now well her position in society is so much higher than yours that you can t hope to marry her so all i ask is that you don t bother her any more and marry fanny why should i asked troy carelessly i ll pay you if you leave weatherbury today i ll give you fifty pounds fanny will have fifty pounds for wedding clothes and i ll give her five hundred pounds the day she marries you boldwood s manner showed that he was a little ashamed of offering money but he was prepared to do almost anything to prevent troy marrying bathsheba troy appeared to consider the offer it s true i like fanny best although she s only a maid fifty pounds now you said here s the money said boldwood handing the soldier a purse of gold coins stop listen said troy in a whisper light footsteps could be heard on the road coming from bathsheba s house it s bathsheba she s expecting me i must go and speak to her and say goodbye to her as you and i have arranged why do you need to speak to her she ll look for me if i don t don t worry you ll hear every word i say to her it may help you in your courting when i ve gone stand over there behind the tree and listen troy stepped forward and whistled a double note frank darling is that you it was bathsheba s voice oh god said boldwood unheard behind the tree yes it s me replied troy you rs so late frank she continued the coach arrived a long time ago frank it s so lucky there s nobody in my house except me tonight so nobody will know about your visit excellent said troy but i ll just have to cdlect my bag so you run home and i promise to be there in ten minutes yes frank she ran back to her house troy turned to boldwood who had stepped out from behind the tree his face white and his whole body trembling shall i tell her i cannot marry her laughed the soldier no no wait i have more to say to you whispered boldwood the muscles in his face strangely out of control now said troy you see my problem i can t marry them both but i have two reasons for choosing fanny first i like her best i think and second you re paying me for it at that moment boldwood lost control he attacked troy fiercely holding his neck with botn hands wait gasped troy who had not expected this let me breathe if you kill me you injure the woman you love what do you mean cried the farmer i should kill you like a dog but he let go of troy s neck and listened you heard how bathsheba loves me and expects me to visit her tonight soon the whole village will know this the only way to save her good name and her position in weatherbury is for me to marry her true true agreed boldwood after a pause troy marry her poor weak woman she must love you madly to give herself so completely to you but what about fanny asked the soldier cleverly don t desert her troy i beg you i don t mean fanny i m speaking of bathsheba how can i persuade you i know i ll pay you five hundred pounds on the day you marry bathsheba troy was secretly shocked at boldwood s wild offer and i ll receive something now as well he asked yes all the money i have with me he counted the coins in his pocket twenty one pounds it s all for you give me the money and we ll go to her house i ll ask her to marry me of course i won t say anything about the money they went along the road to the farmhouse and boldwood waited outside while troy entered he returned in a moment with a piece cut out of a bath newspaper here read this first he said smiling and boldwood read marriages on the th in bath frank troy sergeant to bathsheba everdene of weatherbury the paper fell from boldwood s hands as the soldier began to laugh fifty pounds to marry fanny twenty one pounds not to marry fanny but bathsheba and now you see i m already bathsheba s husband you re a fool boldwood although i may be a bad man i d never bribe anyone to mar ry as you ve tried to and fanny she left me long ago and i don t know where she is i ve searched everywhere for her now take your money back i don t want it and troy threw the gold coins into the road you black hearted dog i ll punish you one day remember that cried the broken man troy laughed loudly as he closed bathsheba s front door through the whole of the long night that followed boldwood s dark figure could be seen walking over the hills of weatherbury like a ghost just before the clock struck five the next morning gabriel and coggan were walking to the hayfields past their mistress s house when they saw a surprising sight bathsheba s bedroom window was open and looking out of it was a hand some man with his red jacket undone it was sergeant troy she s married him whispered coggan gabriel said nothing but he felt so ill that he had to rest on the gate for a moment he thought with pity of her future as he knew her marriage to troy could not be happy for long good morning friends shouted troy cheerfully to the men we must be polite to him whispered coggan if he s married the mistress good morning sergeant troy said gabriel miserably now that i ve left the army i ll soon be down in the fields with you again said troy lightly my new position won t change that and i ll be friendly with you all just as before drink to my health men and he threw a coin towards gabriel who refused to pick it up coggan however put it in his pocket as they went on their way they noticed mr boldwood riding past them gabriel forgot his own sadness when he saw the bitterness and deep despair on the farmer s face the storm there was always a harvest supper for the farm workers after all the hay and wheat had been cut on behalf of his wife sergeant troy decided to have it one evening at the end of august in the great barn the weather was unpleas antly warm that night on his way to the harvest supper gabriel stopped to check the eight huge hay and wheat ricks if as he suspected there was a storm the ricks which were all uncovered would be badly damaged he went on to the barn where the farm workers had already finished eating and started dancing gabriel had to wait until sergeant troy had finished his dance with bathshe ba before he could warn him about possible damage to the ricks troy however was enjoying himself too much to listen to gabriel s message friends he was saying i ve ordered brandy to be served to you all so that we can celebrate my wedding properly no frank don t give them brandy begged bathsheba it will only do them harm don t be silly said troy friends let s send the women home then we men can drink and sing as much as we like angrily bathsheba left the barn followed by the other women gabriel left soon afterwards later when he went to check that bathsheba s sheep were safe he noticed that they looked very frightened they were crowded together in a corner their tails pointing the same way to the shepherd this meant they were expecting a storm he went to look at the ricks again should the whole harvest of the farm worth at least seven hundred and fifty pounds be lost because of a woman s weakness never if i can prevent it thought gabriel he returned to the barn to ask the other farm workers to help him cover the ricks but the only noise he could hear coming from the barn was the men s loud and regular breathing and when he entered he found them all asleep in cluding troy the brandy which they had been too polite to refuse had made them drunk in a very short time as they were not used to drinking anything stronger than beer it was useless trying to wake them gabriel left the barn and returned to the ricks two of which he managed to cover with the heavy material kept on the farm for this purpose the only way to cover the other six ricks was by thatching them with straw and this was a long and difficult job to do alone the moon disappeared and there was a slow light wind like the breath of a dying man as gabriel climbed the ladder and started thatching high up on top of the third rick light ning flashed in the sky and there was a loud crash of thunder in the sudden brightness gabriel could see every tree around him until the light disappeared just as suddenly leaving him in the blackest darkness he knew his position was dangerous but considered his life was not valuable enough to worry about another flash of lightning allowed him to see the figure of a woman running towards the rick was it bathsheba is that you ma am he called to the darkness who s there said bathsheba s voice it s gabriel i m on the rick thatching oh gabriel i m so worried about the ricks can we save them the thunder woke me i can t find my husband is he there no he isn t he s asleep in the barn he promised me the ricks would be covered and he hasn t done it can i help you let me help you can bring the straw up to me in armfuls if you aren t afraid to climb the ladder in the dark said gabriel i ll do anything to help she said she started to go up and down the ladder carrying the straw in the brightness of the lightning gabriel saw their two shadows wildly enlarged on the hill in front of him then came the loudest crash so far how terrible cried bathsheba and held on to his arm the lightning flashed in a wild dance of death and thunder came from every part of the huge sky bathsheba and gabriel could only stare and tremble at the strange and dangerous beauty of the storm as they watched a tall tree in front of them seemed to be burning with a white flame there was a final violent crash of thunder and in the bright light they saw that the tree had been torn in half by the lightning that was close to us said gabriel we d better go down they climbed down and stood together in the darkness bathsheba seeming to think only of the storm gabriel thinking only of her at last he said the storm appears to have passed but the rain will be coming soon i ll go up and finish thatching the ricks gabriel you are kind to me oh why aren t the others here don t tell me i know they re all drunk in the barn aren t they it was my husband s fault gabriel i want to tell you something the soft flashes of the dying lightning showed her face very white against the black sky i care about your good opinion of me so i want to explain why i went to bath that night it wasn t to marry troy it was to break off my relationship with him perhaps you wonder why i married him then well i suppose i must tell you it was because he told me he had seen a woman more beautiful than me and said that if i wanted him as a husband i must marry him at once i was wild with love and jealousy so i married him gabriel did not reply i ll bring some more straw up to you shall i she offered she made several more journeys before he noticed her tired ness i think you d better go indoors now he said as gently as a mother i ll finish the work alone if i m useless i ll go said bathsheba but oh if you fell you aren t useless but you re tired you ve done well and you ve done better she said gratefully thank you a thousand times gabriel goodnight she disappeared in the darkness he went on thatching in a kind of dream she had spoken more warmly to him tonight than she had ever done when she was unmarried and free to speak as warmly as she liked the wind changed and became stronger at the same time heavy rain started falling as gabriel worked on the top of the ricks he suddenly remembered that eight months before he had been fighting against fire in the same place as desperately as he was fighting against water now and for love of the same woman who did not love him it was not until seven o clock in the morning that gabriel climbed down from the last rick exhausted and wet to the skin he noticed figures coming out of the barn walking slowly and painfully to their homes they all looked ashamed except troy who was whistling cheerfully as he entered the farmhouse none of them thought of looking at the ricks on his way back to coggan s house gabriel met boldwood how are you sir asked gabriel yes it s a wet day oh i m very well thank you you look a little different sir no you re wrong oak i m just the same nothing hurts me but you look tired i ve been working all night to get our ricks covered never worked so hard in my life yours are safe of course sir oh yes boldwood added after a silence what did you ask your ricks are all covered no none of them i forgot to tell the men to thatch them i expect most of my wheat will be destroyed in this rain forgot repeated gabriel to himself it was difficult to believe that the most careful farmer in the area would lose all his harvest because of a moment s forgetfulness this would never have happened before boldwood fell in love with bathsheba boldwood clearly wanted to talk although it was still raining heavily oak you knew i wanted to get married i thought my mistress was going to marry you said gabriel sympathetically however nothing that we expect ever happens he spoke with the calmness of a man used to disaster perhaps the villagers laugh at me said boldwood with a pretended lightness oh no i don t think so but the truth is that we were never engaged so she never broke off the engagement you see but boldwood could not remain calm oh gabriel he said wildly i m weak and foolish and i feel it s better to die than to live after a silence he continued more normally i ve accepted the fact of her refusal now i m sorry of course but no woman has ever controlled my life well good morning bathsheba discovers the truth summer turned into autumn and one saturday evening in october bathsheba and her husband were riding home from casterbridge market yes if it hadn t rained so hard i d have won two hundred pounds easily my love troy was saying the horse i put my money on fell over in the mud you see such bad luck but frank said bathsheba miserably do you realize you ve lost more than a hundred pounds in a month with this awful horse racing it s foolish of you to spend my money like that you ll promise not to go to the next race on monday won t you it doesn t matter whether i go or not i ve already put money on an excellent horse in the monday race don t cry bathsheba if i d known you were so cautious i d never have he did not finish what he was saying just then they noticed a woman walking towards them although it was almost dark they could see that she was poorly dressed please sir do you know what time the casterbridge workhouse closes she asked in a voice of extreme sadness troy jumped in surprise but kept his face turned away from her before replying i don t know when the woman hear him speak and looked up to his face her expression showed both pain and happiness she gave a cry and fell to the ground unconscious oh poor thing cried bathsheba i ll help her no stay on your horse and take mine ordered troy jumping down take the horses to the top of the hill bathsheba obeyed and moved away troy lifted up the woman i thought you were far away or dead he told her in a strangely gentle voice why didn t you write to me fanny i was afraid to have you any money no here s all i have it s not much i can t ask my wife for any more at the moment the woman said nothing listen continued troy i ll have to leave you now you re going to the casterbridge workhouse well stay there for tonight and tomorrow anyway but i ll find somewhere better for you i ll meet you on monday morning at ten o clock on the bridge just outside town i ll bring you all the money i can goodbye at the top of the hill bathsheba turned and saw the woman walking slowly on towards casterbridge troy soon caught up with his wife he looked very upset who is that woman bathsheba looked closely into his face she s not important to either of us he replied coldly i think you know her bathsheba went on i don t care what you think he answered and they continued their ride in silence the two miles to casterbridge seemed a very long way to the woman who was tired and ill sometimes she walked sometimes she rested a little beside the road all through the night her eyes were fixed on the lights of casterbridge the end of her journey at six o clock the next morning she finally fell in front of the door of the workhouse and the people there took her in bathsheba and her husband did not speak much that evening or the following day but on sunday evening troy said suddenly bathsheba could you let me have twenty pounds i need it ah she said sadly for the races tomorrow oh frank only a few weeks ago you said i was far sweeter than all your other pleasures now won t you stop risking money on horses which is more a worry than a pleasure say yes to your wife frank say yes her beautiful face would have persuaded most men including troy if he had not been married to her but he no longer loved her enough to agree to anything she wanted well the money isn t for racing anyway he said don t keep me short of money bathsheba or you ll be sorry i m sorry already she replied sorry that our love has come to an end love always ends after marriage i think you hate me no not you i only hate your faults then why not help me to improve come let s be friends just give me the twenty pounds well here s the money take it thank you i expect i ll be away before breakfast tomor row must you go frank stay with me there was a time when you used to call me darling now you don t care how i spend my time i must go said troy taking out his watch he opened the back of the watch case and bathsheba who happened to be looking saw that there was a curl of hair hidden inside oh frank she gasped a woman s hair whose is it troy closed the watch immediately and replied carelessly why yours of course i d quite forgotten i had it you re lying frank it s yellow hair mine is darker well all right if i must tell you it s the hair of a young woman i was going to marry before i met you tell me her name is she married i can t tell you her name but she s single is she alive is she pretty yes to both questions how can she be pretty poor thing with hair that colour her hair has been admired by everybody who s seen her it s beautiful hair don t be jealous bathsheba you shouldn t have married me if you didn t trust me this is all i get for loving you so much cried bathsheba bitterly i would have died for you when i married you and now you laugh at my foolishness in marrying you but you ll burn that hair won t you frank to please me troy only answered i have a duty to someone in my past mistakes were made which i must put right that s more important than my relationship with you if you re sorry you married me well so am i frank i m only sorry if you love another woman more than me said bathsheba in a trembling voice you like the woman with that pretty hair yes it is pretty was she the woman we met on the road last night well yes now you know the truth i hope you re happy you haven t told me everything tell me the whole truth she said looking bravely into his face i never thought i d beg a man to do anything but my pride has all gone don t be so desperate said troy crossly he left the room bathsheba was in deep despair she knew that she had lost her independence as a woman which she had been so proud of she hated herself for falling in love so easily with her hand some husband who she now realized could not be trusted the next morning troy left the house early bathsheba was walking in her garden when she noticed gabriel oak and mr boldwood deep in conversation in the road they called to joseph poorgrass who was picking apples and soon he came along the path to bathsheba s house well what s the message joseph she asked curious i m afraid fanny robin s dead ma am dead in the casterbridge workhouse no why what did she die from i don t know ma am but she was never very strong mr boldwood is sending a cart to bring her back to be buried here oh i won t let mr boldwood do that fanny was my uncle s maid and mine too how very sad to die in a work house tell mr boldwood that you will drive my new cart over to casterbridge this afternoon to fetch her body and joseph put flowers on the cart for poor fanny how long was she in the workhouse only a day ma am she arrived ill and exhausted on sunday morning she came on foot through weatherbury the colour left bathsheba s face at one along the road from weatherbury to casterbridge she asked eagerly when did she pass weatherbury last saturday night it was ma am thank you joseph you may go later that afternoon bathsheba asked liddy what was the colour of poor fanny robin s hair i only saw her for a day or two she used to keep it covered but it was lovely golden hair ma am her young man was a soldier wasn t he yes and mr troy knows him well what mr troy told you that yes one day i asked him if he knew fanny s young man and he said he knew him as well as he knew himself that s enough liddy said bathsheba her anxiety mak ing her unusually cross fanny s revenge that afternoon joseph poorgrass was bringing fanny s coffin back from casterbridge feeling a little frightened of the dead body behind him in the cart and de pressed by the autumn fog he stopped for some beer at a pub where he met jan coggan and laban tall there gabriel oak found the three men completely drunk two hours later as joseph was clearly incapable of driving the cart gabriel drove it to weatherbury himself on the way into the village the vicar stopped him i m afraid it s too late now for the burial he said but i can arrange for the body to be buried tomorrow i could take the coffin to the church for the night sir offered gabriel hoping to prevent bathsheba from seeing it but just then bathsheba herself appeared no gabriel she said poor fanny must rest in her old home for her last night bring the coffin into the house the coffin was carried into a small sitting room and gabriel was left alone with it in spite of all his care the worst had happened and bathsheba was about to make a terrible discovery but suddenly he had an idea he looked at the words written simply on the coffin lid fanny robin and child with a cloth gabriel carefully removed the last two words quietly he left the room bathsheba was in a strange mood she felt lonely and miser able but she had not stopped loving her husband in spite of her anxiety about his past she was waiting for him to come home when liddy knocked and entered ma am maryann has just heard something she hesitated a little not about you or us ma am about fanny there s a story in weatherbury that liddy whis pered in her mistress s ear bathsheba trembled from head to foot i don t believe it she cried there s only one name on the coffin lid but i suppose it could be true she said no more and liddy went quietly out of the room bathsheba felt almost sure she knew the truth about fanny and troy but she wanted to be certain she entered the sitting room where the coffin lay holding her hot hands to her fore head she cried tell me your secret fanny i hope it isn t true there are two of you if i could only look at you i d know after a pause she added slowly and i will a few moments later she stood beside the uncovered coffin staring in she said it was best to know the worst and i know it now her tears fell fast beside the dead pair in the coffin tears for fanny and for herself although bathsheba not fanny had married troy in death fanny was the winner she was taking her revenge now on bathsheba for the difficulties she had experienced in her life bathsheba forgot the passing of time as she looked at fanny s cold white face and yellow hair and did not realize troy had arrived home he threw open the door and came in he did not guess who was in the coffin what s the matter who s dead he asked bathsheba tried to push past him let me out she cried no stay i insist he held her arm and together they looked into the coffin troy stood completely still when he saw the mother and ba by little by little his shoulders bent forward and his face showed deep sadness bathsheba was watching his expression closely and she had never been more miserable slowly troy knelt to give fanny robin a gentle kiss bathsheba threw her arms round his neck crying wildly from the depths of her heart don t don t kiss them oh frank no i love you better than she did kiss me too frank you will kiss me too frank troy looked puzzled for a moment not expecting this child like cry from his proud wife but then he pushed her away i will not kiss you he said can you give me a reason asked bathsheba fighting to control herself perhaps it was unfortunate that she asked i ve been a bad black hearted man but this woman dead as she is is more to me than you ever were or are or can be i would have married her if i d never seen your beau tiful face and i wish i had married her he turned to fanny but never mind darling he said in the sight of god you are my wife at these words a long low cry of despair and anger came from bathsheba s lips if she s that what am i you are nothing to me nothing said troy heartlessly a ceremony in front of a vicar doesn t make a marriage i don t consider myself your husband bathsheba wanted only to get away from him and his words she ran straight out of the house she stayed out all night wrapped in a cloak waiting for the coffin to be taken for burial as soon as the men had taken it away the next morning she re entered the house very cautiously to avoid troy but her husband had gone out very early and did not return sergeant troy leaves when bathsheba ran out of the house the previous night troy first replaced the coffin lid then went upstairs to lie on his bed and wait miserably for the morning the day before on monday he had waited for fanny as arranged on the bridge just outside casterbridge for over an hour he had bathsheba s twenty pounds and seven pounds of his own to give fanny when she did not come he became angry remembering the last time she had failed to arrive on her wedding day in fact she was at that moment being put in her coffin at the workhouse but he did not know that he rode straight to the races at budmouth and stayed there all afternoon but he was still thinking of fanny and he did not risk any money on the horses only on his way home did he suddenly realize that illness could have prevented her from meeting him and only when he entered the farmhouse that evening did he discover that she was dead on tuesday morning troy got up and without even thinking about bathsheba went straight to the churchyard to find the position of fanny s grave he continued on foot to casterbridge to order the best gravestone available for twenty seven pounds which was all the money he had having ar ranged for it to be put on the grave that afternoon he returned to weatherbury in the evening with a basket of flowering plants the new gravestone was already in place and he worked solidly for several hours in the churchyard putting the plants carefully into the soft earth of her grave when it started raining however he decided to spend the rest of the night in the shelter of the church and finish his planting in the morning the rain that night was unusually heavy and water began to pour from a broken pipe on the church roof straight on to fanny s grave as the earth there had only recently been dug the grave became a kind of muddy pool soon the plants were floating on top of the grave and then were washed away in the stream of water flowing through the churchyard when troy woke up stiff and still tired he went out of the church to finish work on the grave the rain had stopped and the sun was shining through the red and gold autumn leaves the air was warm and clear as troy walked along the path he noticed it was very muddy and covered with plants surely these could not be the ones he had planted he turned the corner and saw the damage the heavy rain had done the new gravestone was stained with mud and there was a shallow hole in the grave where the water had poured in nearly all the plants had been washed out of the grave this strange accident had a worse effect on troy than any of his troubles worse even than fanny s death he had tried to show his love for her knowing that he had failed to do so when she was alive planting the flowers was also a way of softening his feelings of sadness and guilt at her death and now his work had been destroyed he was too depressed to start work on the grave again he left it as it was and went silently out of the churchyard a minute later he had left the village meanwhile bathsheba had spent a day and a night as a willing prisoner in a small bedroom in her house except when liddy brought her food or messages she kept the bedroom door locked so that her husband could not come in liddy knew there was trouble between husband and wife but did not know the reason on wednesday morning she brought breakfast up to bathsheba what heavy rain we had in the night ma am she said yes and there was a strange noise from the churchyard gabriel thinks it was water from a broken pipe on the church roof and he s gone there to see are you going to the churchyard ma am to look at fanny s grave did mr troy come in last night bathsheba asked anxiously no ma am he didn t and laban tall says he saw mr troy walking out of the village towards budmouth replied liddy budmouth thirteen miles away at once bathsheba s heart felt lighter yes liddy i need some fresh air i ll go to see fanny s grave she said and after breakfast she walked almost cheerfully to the churchyard she saw the hole in the grave and the expensive new grave stone but did not think it could be fanny s she looked round for a plain grave then she noticed gabriel reading the words on the gravestone and her eyes followed his this stone was put up by francis troy in loving memory of fanny robin who died on october aged gabriel looked anxiously at her to see if she was upset but she remained calm she asked him to fill in the hole and have the broken water pipe repaired finally to show she did not hate the woman who had caused her such bitterness she replanted the flowers herself and cleaned the muddy grave stone so that the words could be read clearly then she went home troy meanwhile was walking towards the south he could not decide what to do next all he knew was that he had to get away from weatherbury at the top of a hill he saw the sea stretching for miles in front of him now he felt more cheerful and decided to swim so he climbed down the cliffs undressed on the beach and jumped into the sea the water was so smooth that he swam confidently out to where it was very deep here he was surprised and a little frightened to find that he was being carried further out to sea he suddenly remembered that the budmouth coast was famous for the num ber of swimmers drowned there every year and he began to be afraid that he would soon be one of them however strongly he swam the sea pulled him further away from the coast and he was already beginning to feel tired and breathless just then he saw a small boat moving out to sea towards a ship with his right arm he swam and with his left he waved wildly shouting as loudly as he could the sailors saw him at once and rowed over to rescue him farmer boldwood begins to hope when troy did not return bathsheba felt neither happiness nor sadness she had no hope for the fu ture she was sure that one day he would return and spend the rest of her money then they would have to sell the farm she could do nothing to prevent it one saturday at casterbridge market a stranger came up to her i must tell you ma am he said your husband is dead no it can t be true gasped bathsheba darkness came over her eyes and she fell but not to the ground boldwood who had been standing in a corner watching her ran forward to catch her tell me more he said to the stranger as he held the unconscious girl gently in his arms the police found her husband s clothes on the beach he must have been swimming and drowned off the budmouth coast there was a strange excitement in boldwood s face but he said nothing he carried her to a private room at the hotel where she could rest until she felt well enough to ride home when she arrived home still feeling weak and confused liddy had already heard the news shall we get some black clothes made for you ma am said the maid hesitating a little no liddy it isn t necessary you see i think he may still be alive i feel i think i m sure he s alive but the following monday troy s death was reported in the local newspaper a witness had seen him in deep water shouting and waving for help and when his clothes and his watch found on the beach were delivered to the farmhouse bathsheba began to doubt that he was alive she opened the back of his watch case and took out the curl of golden hair he was fanny s and she was his she said to herself they should be together i mean nothing to either of them why should i keep her hair she held the curl over the fire no i won t burn it i ll keep it in memory of her poor thing through the autumn and winter bathsheba s life was more peaceful she no longer took such an interest in the farm and very sensibly appointed gabriel oak her farm manager he had already been doing the job unofficially and now would be paid for it at last his good qualities were being recognized gabriel s luck had certainly changed boldwood could not concentrate on farming these days either his wheat and hay had all been so damaged by the rain that it was worthless weatherbury people were shocked by the changes they had no ticed recently in farmer boldwood soon he himself realized that something must be done and arranged for gabriel to manage his farm too so gabriel was responsible for both the important farms in the area while their owners sat alone in their lonely farmhouses after a time boldwood started to hope that one day if bathsheba remarried at all she would marry him he tried to maintain a friendly businesslike relationship with her keeping his love for her out of sight until the right moment came to propose again he had no idea how long he would have to wait to marry her but he was prepared to wait for the rest of his life the right moment did not come until the following summer when most of the weatherbury people attended the great sheep fair at greenhill gabriel was there with bathsheba s and boldwood s sheep and so were both his employers this year a travelling circus put up its tent and offered the public a horse riding show most of bathsheba s farm workers were already in the tent when bathsheba herself arrived to see the show at the back of the tent behind a curtain were the circus riders and one of them pulling on his boots was sergeant troy after being rescued troy had decided to stay on the ship and work as a sailor but he was not happy with this travelling life and finally returned to england he hesitated to go back to bathsheba and a comfortable life on the farm perhaps bathsheba would fail at farming and then he would be respon sible for her and anyway perhaps she would not welcome him back for the moment he was working as actor and horse rider with the circus so it was with no plans for the future that troy found himself at greenhill fair dangerously close to weatherbury when he looked through a hole in the curtain to see the audience he was horrified to see his wife she looked more beautiful than he remembered perhaps she would laugh at him a nobleman s son working in a circus as he rode into the tent he was careful to keep his face away from her and remain wrapped in his cloak she did not seem to recognize him when the show was over troy went out into the darkness in the large tent where meals and drinks were being served he saw bathsheba talking to a man was she forgetting her husband so soon thought troy angrily he decided to listen to their conversation and knelt down outside the tent making a little hole with his knife in the heavy cotton so that he could see the two people inside she was drinking a cup of tea which boldwood had just brought her troy watched her every movement she was as handsome as ever and she belonged to him after a few moments troy got up and walked slowly from the tent he was considering what to do next meanwhile boldwood had offered to ride back to weather bury with bathsheba as it was getting late and she accepted her pity for the man she had hurt so deeply made her behave more kindly towards him than was perhaps sensible her kind ness made poor boldwood dream of their future marriage and suddenly unable to stop himself he said mrs troy will you marry again some day you forget that my husband s death has never been proved so i may not really be a widow she said confused i ve a feeling he s alive and i m not thinking of marrying anyone else do you know bathsheba that according to the lawyers you can remarry seven years after your husband s supposed death that is six years from now could you promise to marry me then i don t know six years is too far away i m bitterly sorry i behaved so stupidly towards you but i can promise i ll never marry another man while you want me to be your wife but you could put right the mistake you made by promising to be my wife in six years time there was wild hope in his eyes oh what shall i do i don t love you but if i can give you happiness by just promising then i will consider and promise soon shall we say by christmas you ll promise at christmas well i ll say no more as christmas came nearer bathsheba became more anxious and one day she confessed her difficulty to gabriel the saddest reason of all for agreeing to his proposal she said is that if i don t i m afraid he ll go mad his feelings are so extreme i don t say that because i m vain but i believe i hold that man s future in my hands oh gabriel it s a terrible worry then why don t you promise ma am i don t think people would think it wrong the only thing that makes it wrong in my view is that you don t love him that is my punishment gabriel for playing that foolish trick with the valentine on him gabriel had given her a reasonable sensible answer as she knew he would but she felt annoyed with his cool advice not once had he spoken of his love for her or said that he could wait for her too she would have refused him of course but at least it would have shown that he still admired her mr boldwood s christmas party for months weatherbury people had been discussing the party that mr boldwood was going to give just before christmas and now the day had finally arrived bathsheba was getting ready for it i m upset liddy it s foolish of me i know she said

at the same time in his farmhouse boldwood was also dressing he was trying on a new coat which had just been delivered tonight he wanted to look his best just then gabriel entered to report on farm business oh oak said boldwood you re invited to the party tonight of course i ll try to come if i m not too busy said gabriel quietly i m glad to see you looking happier sir yes i confess i m cheerful tonight but my happiness depends on a hope oak my hands are shaking could you help me with the buttons on this coat and as gabriel came forward to help he went on feverishly oak does a woman keep her promise to become engaged you know women better than i do tell me i don t think i understand women well at all but if she wants to put right a mistake she may keep a promise like that i think she will whispered boldwood she says she can think of me as a husband seven years after troy s disappear ance seven years said gabriel shaking his head a long time but it isn t seven years answered boldwood impatiently it s only five years nine months and a few days now don t build your hopes on her promise sir remember she disappointed you once and she s young she never promised me that first time so she s never broken her promise to me yet i trust her to keep her word but let s talk business for a moment oak you work so hard as my farm manager that i want you to have a larger share of the profits i know a little about your secret you have warm feelings for her too but you ve let me succeed in courting her i want to show you how grateful i am for that oh that s not necessary thank you said gabriel hurriedly i must get used to my disappointment as other men have he left rather worried by boldwood s strange manner outside the front door of boldwood s house a group of men were talking quietly sergeant troy was seen in casterbridge this afternoon said billy smallbury his body was never found you know neighbours should we tell the mistress asked laban tall poor woman what a mistake she made in marrying him just then boldwood came out and walked to the gate he did not notice the men who were standing in the darkness i hope to god she ll come he whispered oh my darling my darling why do you make me wait like this they all heard his words clearly the sound of wheels came from the road and bathsheba arrived boldwood took her into the house and the door closed behind them i didn t realize he was still in love with her said billy poor mr boldwood the news will be hard for him said jan coggan we ll have to tell the mistress her husband s still alive we ll go in and find the right moment to speak to her but the right moment never came bathsheba had planned to stay at the party for only an hour and she was in fact preparing to leave when boldwood found her alone in an upstairs room mrs troy you can t go he said wildly we ve only just begun i d like to go now i think i ll walk home you know what i want to say to you bathsheba looked silently at the floor you do give it he said eagerly give what she asked althoug she knew well what he meant your promise just a business arrangement between two sensible people who no longer think of love to marry me in five to six years you owe it to me i have no feeling in that matter at all she replied hesitating but if i must i promise if i m really a widow you ll marry me in five and three quarter years time let me think i ll marry nobody else oh i don t know is frank really dead perhaps i should ask a lawyer say the words my dear one and i won t speak about it any more a long engagement then marriage oh bathsheba promise yourself to me he begged wildly forgetting his cool businesslike manner i ve loved you so much and for so long very well she said after a pause i ll marry you six years from now if we re both alive and if my husband doesn t return then wear this ring for me boldwood took from his pocket a diamond engagement ring and held it out to her no no i can t i don t want anyone to know just wear it tonight to please me bathsheba could say no more and weakly let him put it on her finger he left her in a few minutes she was calmer she put on her cloak and went downstairs she paused at the foot of the stairs bold wood was standing near the fire and he had just noticed that a group of villagers were whispering among themselves what s the matter men he asked cheerfully is any body engaged or married born or dead tell us the news tall i wish somebody was dead replied laban tall in a whisper what was that tall asked boldwood speak out if you have anything to say at that moment there was a knock on the front door one of the men opened it a stranger wants to see mrs troy he said ask him to come in said boldwood the message was given and troy wrapped up to his eyes in the cloak stood in the doorway those who knew he was in the area recognized him immediately boldwood did not he said come in stranger and have a christmas drink with us troy entered threw off his cloak and looked boldwood in the face but it was only when he laughed that boldwood recognized the man who had destroyed his hope and happiness once and was about to do it again troy turned to bathsheba she had dropped miserably on to the lowest stair her mouth was blue and dry her eyes empty and staring he said bathsheba i ve come here for you she did not reply come home with me do you hear he went towards her a strange thin voice full of despair came from the fire place bathsheba go with your husband said boldwood she did not move and when troy stretched out his hand to pull her towards him she fell back with a quick low scream a second later there was a loud bang and the hall was filled with smoke at bathsheba s cry boldwood s despair had turned to anger from the wall above the fireplace he had taken a gun and shot troy who now lay very still boldwood turned the gun on himself but was stopped by one of his men it doesn t matter boldwood gasped there s another way to die he crossed the room to bathsheba and kissed her hand then he went out into the darkness before anyone could prevent him bathsheba and gabriel gabriel arrived at boldwood s house about five minutes after the shooting the villagers were all shocked and silent but bathsheba was sitting on the floor calmly holding troy s head gabriel she said simply i m afraid it s too late but ride to casterbridge for a doctor mr boldwood has shot my husband gabriel obeyed at once and while riding along was tinking so hard about the shooting that in the darkness he failed to notice a man walking along the road to casterbridge that man was boldwood on his way to casterbridge to confess to his crime bathsheba ordered the body to be removed to her house and by herself she washed and dressed her dead husband for burial but when the doctor the vicar and gabriel arrived and she no longer needed to be strong her self control finally broke and she became very ill on the doctor s advice she was put to bed and her illness continued for several months at his trial the following march boldwood was found guilty of murder for which the usual punishment was death however weatherbury people began to protest publicly that he should not be held responsible for the crime over the last few weeks the villagers had noticed how his moods changed from wild despair to feverish excitement he had forgotten his farm and even lost the previous year s harvest and a pile of carefully wrapped parcels of dresses and jewels was found at his house addressed to bathsheba boldwood and dated six years ahead these were accepted by the judges as signs of his mad ness and in the end boldwood was sent to prison for life gabriel knew that bathsheba blamed herself for troy s death and would have blamed herself even more for boldwood s her health improved only very slowly she hardly ever went out of the house or garden and did not discuss her feelings with anyone even liddy but by the summer she was begin ning to spend more time in the open air and one august evening she walked to the churchyard she could hear the village children inside the church practising their singing for sunday she went straight to fanny s grave and read troy s words on the large gravestone this stone was put up by francis troy in loving memory of fanny robin who died on october aged underneath on the same stone were the words she had added in the same grave lies francis troy who died on december aged as she listened to the sweet voices of the children coming from the church and thought of the pain she had experienced in her short life tears came to her eyes she wished she were as innocent as those children again she was still crying when she suddenly noticed gabriel oak who had come up the path on his way to the church and was watching her sympathetically are you going in she asked trying to dry her tears i was he replied i m one of the church singers you know and tonight s my practice evening but i don t think i ll go in now there was a pause while they both tried to think of something to say at last gabriel said slowly i haven t seen you to speak to for a long time are you better now yes i am she replied i came to look at the gravestone eight months ago it happened said gabriel it seems like yesterday to me and to me it seems like years long years ago there s something i must tell you said gabriel hesitating the fact is i won t be your farm manager much longer i m thinking of leaving england and farming in america leaving england she cried in surprise and disappoint ment but everyone thought you would rent poor mr bold wood s farm and manage it yourself the lawyers have offered it to me it s true but i ll be leaving weatherbury next spring i have my reasons and what shall i do without you oh gabriel we re such old friends you ve helped me so much in the past and now that i m more helpless than ever you re going away it s unfortunate said gabriel unhappily it s because of that helplessness that i have to go and he walked so guickly out of the churchyard that she could not follow him in the next few months bathsheba noticed miserably that gabriel communicated with her as little as possible and then only by messenger she could not avoid thinking that he the last friend she had had lost interest in supporting her and was about to desert her on the day after christmas she received the letter from him which she had been expecting in it he explained that he would leave the farm in three months time bathsheba sat and cried bitterly over this letter she was deeply hurt that gabriel no longer loved her she was also worried about having to manage the farm by herself again she thought about it all morning and was so depressed by the afternoon that she put on her cloak and found her way to where gabriel lived she knocked at the door who is it said gabriel opening the door oh it s you mistress i won t be your mistress much longer will i gabriel she said sadly well no i suppose not because these two people who knew each other well were meeting in a strange place they felt like the strangers they were when they first met and neither spoke for a moment gabriel perhaps i shouldn t have come but i i thought i must have offended you and that s why you re going away offended me you couldn t do that bathsheba couldn t i she said gladly but then why are you going i m not going to america you know i decided not to when you seemed against the idea no i ve arranged to rent mr boldwood s farm and i could have been your farm manager as well if well if people hadn t said things about us what said bathsheba surprised what things well if you must know that i m just waiting and hoping for the chance to marry you some day marry me that s too foolish too soon to think of yes of course it s foolish i certainly agree too soon were the words i used i m sorry but i think you said too foolish i m sorry too she replied with tears in her eyes too soon was what i said but it doesn t matter a bit not at all but i only meant too soon indeed you must believe me gabriel looked into her face for a long time bathsheba he said coming closer if i only knew one thing whether you d allow me to love you and marry you after all if i only knew but you never will know she whispered why not because you never ask oh said gabriel delightedly my darling you should never have sent me that cruel letter this morning it shows you don t care a bit about me now bathsheba he said laughing you know very well that i had to be very careful as a single man working for you a good looking young woman i ve been so worried about your good name that s why i was going to leave and that s the only reason oh i m so glad i came she cried thankfully as she got up to leave i ve thought so much more about you since i imagined you didn t even want to see me again but gabriel i shouldn t have come to visit you i seem to be courting you how awful well i ve courted you my beautiful bathsheba for a very long time so one visit from you isn t much to ask as he walked back to the farmhouse with her they talked of his plans for boldwood s farm they spoke very little of their feelings for each other they were such old friends that expressions of love were probably unnecessary their shared interests and their long friendly relationship had given them a complete understanding of each other s character and this finally developed after their wedding into a love that nothing could destroy txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com mr lockwood visits wuthering heights i have just returned from a visit to my landlord mr heathcliff i am delighted with the house i am renting from him thrushcross grange is miles away from any town or village that suits me perfectly and the scenery here in yorkshire is so beautiful mr heathcliff in fact is my only neighbour and i think his character is similar to mine he does not like people either my name is lockwood i said when i met him at the gate to his house i m renting thrushcross grange from you i just wanted to come and introduce myself he said nothing but frowned and did not encourage me to enter after a while however he decided to invite me in joseph take mr lock wood s horse he called and bring up some wine from the cellar joseph was a very old servant with a sour expression on his face he looked crossly up at me as he took my horse god help us a visitor he muttered to himself perhaps there were no other servants i thought and it seemed that mr heathcliff hardly ever received guests his house is called wuthering heights the name means a windswept house on a hill and it is a very good description the trees around the house do not grow straight but are bent by the north wind which blows over the moors every day of the year fortunately the house is strongly built and is not damaged even by the worst winter storms the name earn shaw is cut into a stone over the front door mr heathcliff and i entered the huge main room it could have been any yorkshire farmhouse kitchen except that there was no sign of cooking and no farmer sitting at the table mr heathcliff certainly does not look like a farmer his hair and skin are dark like a gipsy s but he has the manners of a gentleman he could perhaps take more care with his appearance but he is handsome i think he is proud and also unhappy we sat down by the fire in silence joseph shouted mr heathcliff no answer came from the cellar so he dived down there leaving me alone with several rather fierce looking dogs suddenly one of them jumped angrily up at me and in a moment all the others were attacking me from every shadowy corner in the great room appeared a growling animal ready to kill me it seemed help mr heathcliff help i shouted trying to keep the dogs back my landlord and his servant were in no hurry to help and could not have climbed the cellar steps more slowly but luckily a woman who i supposed was the housekeeper rushed into the room to calm the dogs what the devil is the matter mr heathcliff asked me rudely when he finally entered the room your dogs sir i replied you shouldn t leave a stranger with them they re dangerous come come mr lockwood have some wine we don t often have strangers here and i m afraid neither i nor my dogs are used to receiving them i could not feel offended after this and accepted the wine we sat drinking and talking together for a while i suggested visiting him tomorrow he did not seem eager to see me again but i shall go anyway i am interested in him even if he isn t interested in me two days later yesterday afternoon was misty and bitterly cold but i walked the four miles to wuthering heights and arrived just as it was beginning to snow i banged on the front door for ten minutes getting colder and colder finally joseph s head appeared at a window of one of the farm buildings what do you want he growled could you let me in i asked desperately he shook his head there s only mrs heathcliff indoors and she won t open the door to you just then a young man appeared and called me to follow him we went through the back door and into the big room where i had been before i was delighted to see a warm fire and a table full of food and this time there was a woman sitting by the fire she must be mrs heathcliff i thought i had not imagined my landlord was married she looked at me coldly without saying anything terrible weather i remarked there was silence what a beautiful animal i tried again pointing to one of the dogs that had attacked me she still said nothing but got up to make the tea she was only about seventeen with the most beautiful little face i had ever seen her golden wavy hair fell around her shoulders have you been invited to tea she asked me crossly no but you are the proper person to invite me i smiled for some reason this really annoyed her she stopped making the tea and threw herself angrily back in her chair meanwhile the young man was staring aggressively at me he looked like a farm worker but seemed to be part of the family i did not feel at all comfortable at last heathcliff came in here i am sir as i promised i said cheerfully you shouldn t have come he answered shaking the snow off his clothes you ll never find your way back in the dark perhaps you could lend me a servant to guide me back to the grange i asked no i couldn t there aren t any servants here except joseph and the housekeeper get the tea ready will you he added fiercely to the young woman i was shocked by his unpleasantness we sat down to eat i tried to make conversation with the three silent people round the table how happy you must be mr heathcliff i began in this quiet place with your wife and my wife my wife s ghost you mean i suddenly realized i had made a serious mistake so his wife was dead of course he was too old to be married to that young girl she must be married to the young man next to me who was drinking his tea out of a bowl and eating his bread with unwashed hands perhaps the poor girl had found no one better to marry in this uninhabited area i turned politely to the young man ah so you are this lady s husband this was worse than before his face went red and he seemed only just able to stop himself hitting me he muttered something i could not hear wrong again mr lockwood said mr heathcliff no her husband my son is dead this he added looking scornfully at the young man is certainly not my son my name is hareton earnshaw growled the young man we finished our meal in silence and when i looked out of the window all i could see was darkness and snow i don t think i can get home without a guide i said politely no one answered me i turned to the woman mrs heathcliff i begged what can i do please help me take the road you came on she replied without interest opening a book that s the best advice i can give mr heathcliff i ll have to stay here for the night i told him i hope that will teach you not to walk over the moors in bad weather he answered i don t keep guest bedrooms you can share a bed with hareton or joseph i was so angry with them all that i could not stay there a moment longer and rushed out into the darkness i saw joseph by the back door caught hold of the lamp he was carrying and ran with it to the gate but the dogs chased after me and attacked me and i was soon knocked to the ground heathcliff and hareton stood at the door laughing as i shouted at the dogs and tried to get up in the end i was again rescued by the housekeeper zillah who ordered away the dogs and helped me to my feet i was so bruised and exhausted that i did not feel strong enough to walk home and although i did not want to i had to spend the night at wuthering heights nobody wished me goodnight as zillah took me upstairs to find a bed for me catherine earnshaw s room quietly sir whispered the housekeeper as we climbed up the dark stairs my master will be angry if he discovers which bedroom you re sleeping in for some rea son he doesn t want anyone to sleep there i don t know why they re strange people in this house you know here s the room sir but i was too tired to listen thank you zillah i said and taking the candle i entered the room and closed the door the only piece of furniture in the large dusty bedroom was a bed placed next to the window there were heavy curtains which could be pulled around it to hide the sleeper from anyone else in the room looking inside the curtains i saw a little shelf full of books just under the window i put my can dle down on the shelf and dropped thankfully on to the bed i closed the curtains around the bed and felt safe from heathcliff and everyone else at wuthering heights i noticed that there were names written on the wall in childish handwriting catherine earnshaw catherine heathcliff and catherine linton then i fell asleep but i was woken very suddenly by a smell of burning my candle had fallen on to a bible on the shelf and was burning it when i opened the bible to see if it was damaged i found that wherever there was an empty page or half a page someone had written on it and on the first page was written catherine earnshaw s diary who was the girl who had slept in this bed written her name on the wall and then written her diary in the bible twenty five years ago i read it with interest how i hate my brother hindley it began he is so cruel to poor heathcliff if only my father hadn t died while he was alive heathcliff was like a brother to hindley and me but now hindley and his wife frances have inherited the house and the money and they hate heathcliff that horrible old servant joseph is always angry with heathcliff and me because we don t pray or study the bible and when he tells his master hindley always punishes us i can t stop crying poor heathcliff hindley says he is wicked and can t play with me or eat with me any more my eyes were beginning to close again and i fell asleep never before had i passed such a terrible night disturbed by the most frightening dreams suddenly i was woken by a gentle knocking on the window it must be the branch of a tree i thought and tried to sleep again outside i could hear the wind driving the snow against the window but i could not sleep the knocking annoyed me so much that i tried to open the window when it did not open i broke the glass angrily and stretched out my hand towards the branch but instead my fingers closed around a small ice cold hand it held my hand tightly and a voice cried sadly let me in let me in who are you i asked trying to pull my hand away catherine linton it replied i ve come home i lost my way there seemed to be a child s face looking in at the window terror made me cruel i rubbed the creature s tiny wrist against the broken glass so that blood poured down on to the bed as soon as the cold fingers let go for a moment i pulled my hand quickly back put a pile of books in front of the broken window and tried not to listen to the desperate cries outside go away i called i ll never let you in not if you go on crying for twenty years it is almost twenty years replied the sad little voice i ve been out here in the dark for nearly twenty years the hand started pushing through the window at the pile of books and i knew it would find me and catch hold of me again unable to move i stared in horror at the shape behind the glass and screamed there were rapid footsteps outside my bedroom door and then i saw the light of a candle in the room is anyone here whispered heathcliff he could not see me behind the curtains and clearly did not expect an answer i knew i could not hide from him so i opened the curtains wide i was surprised by the effect of my action heathcliff dropped his candle and stood without moving his face as white as the wall behind him he did not seem to recognize me it s only your guest lockwood i said i m sorry i must have had a bad dream and screamed in my sleep to the devil with you mr lockwood growled my landlord who allowed you to sleep in this room who was it it was your housekeeper mr heathcliff i said quickly putting my clothes on and i m angry with her myself no one can sleep in a room full of ghosts what do you mean asked heathcliff looking suddenly very interested ghosts you say that little girl catherine linton or earnshaw or whatever her name was must have been wicked she told me she had been a ghost for nearly twenty years it was probably a punishment for her wickedness how dare you speak of her to me cried heathcliff wildly but as i described my dream he became calmer and sat down on the bed trembling as he tried to control his feelings mr lockwood he said finally brushing a tear from his eye you can go into my bedroom to sleep for the rest of the night i ll stay here for a while no more sleep for me tonight i replied i ll wait in the kitchen until it s daylight and then i ll leave you needn t worry about my visiting you again either i ve had enough company for a long time but as i turned to go downstairs my landlord thinking he was alone threw himself on the bed pushed open the window and called into the darkness come in come in he cried tears rolling down his face catherine do come my darling hear me this time but only the snow and wind blew into the room how could my dream have produced such madness i could not watch his suffering any more and went downstairs i waited in the kitchen until it was light enough outside for me to find my way through the deep snow back to thrushcross grange the housekeeper there ellen dean rushed out to welcome me home she thought i must have died in the previous night s snowstorm with a warm fire and a hot meal i began to recover from my unpleasant experiences after my stay at wuthering heights i thought i would never want to speak to any human being again but by the end of the next day i was beginning to feel lonely i decided to ask mrs dean to sit with me after supper how long have you lived in this house i asked her eighteen years sir i came here early in when my mistress was married to look after her and when she died i stayed here as housekeeper who was your mistress i asked her name was catherine earnshaw she replied ah my ghostly catherine i muttered quietly to myself she married mr edgar linton a neighbour added mrs dean and they had a daughter cathy who married mr heathcliff s son ah so that must be the widow young mrs heathcliff at wuthering heights that s right sir did you see her i looked after her as a baby you know how is she i do want to know she looked very well and very beautiful but i don t think she s happy oh poor thing and what did you think of mr heathcliff he s a rough hard man mrs dean but i m very interested in him tell me more about him well he s very rich of course and mean at the same time he could live here at thrushcross grange which is a finer house than wuthering heights but he would rather receive rent than live comfortably but i ll tell you the whole story of his life as much as i know that is and then you can judge for yourself ellen dean s story catherine and heathcliff as children when i was a child i was always at wuthering heights because my mother was a servant with the earnshaw family they are a very old family who have lived in that house for centuries as you can see from their name on the stone over the front door i grew up with catherine and hindley earnshaw and we three played together as children one day their father mr earnshaw came back from a long journey he had travelled sixty miles to liverpool and back on business and was very tired look what i ve brought you he told us all unwrapping something he was holding carefully in his arms catherine and hindley were expecting presents and they rushed eagerly to see what it was they were very disappointed to see only a dirty black haired gipsy child i found him all alone in the busy streets of liverpool mr earnshaw explained to them and i couldn t leave him to die he can sleep in your room but hindley and catherine were angry because they had not received any presents and refused to let the strange child share their room however mr earn shaw insisted and little by little the boy became accepted by the family he was called heathcliff as a first and last name no one ever discovered who his parents had been catnerine and he became great friends but hindley hated him and was often cruel to him old mr earnshaw was strangely fond of this gipsy child and frequently punished his son for behaving badly to heathcliff hindley began to be jealous of his father s feelings for heathcliff and saw them both as enemies this situation could not last as mr earnshaw grew old and ill heathcliff became even more his favourite and hindley often quarrelled with his father when hindley was sent away to study i hoped that we would have peace in the house but then it was that old servant joseph who caused trouble he tried to persuade his master to be stricter with the children and was always complaining that heathcliff and catherine did not spend enough time studying the bible or attending church services catherine was a wild wicked girl in those days we had to watch her every moment of the day to stop her playing her tricks on us she was proud and liked giving orders but she had the prettiest face and the sweetest smile you ve ever seen i could forgive her anything when she came to say she was sorry she was much too fond of heathcliff and the worst punishment we could invent was to keep her separate from him her father could no longer understand her or her behaviour and catherine did not realize that his illness made him less patient with her at last mr earnshaw found peace he died quietly in his chair by the fire one october evening in the night was wild and stormy and we were all sitting together in the big kitchen joseph was reading his bible at the table while catherine had her head on her father s knee he was pleased to see her so gentle for once and she was singing him to sleep i was glad the old gentleman was sleeping so well but when it was time to go to bed catherine put her arms round her father s neck to say goodnight and immediately screamed oh he s dead heathcliff he s dead heathcliff and i started crying loudly and bitterly too joseph told me to fetch the doctor so i ran to the village although i knew it was too late when i came back i went to the children s room to see if they needed me and i listened for a moment at their door they were imagining the dead man in a beautiful distant place far from the troubles of this world and as i listened crying silently i could not help wishing we were all there safe together catherine earnshaw gets to know the lintons hindley came home for his father s burial what was more surprising was that he brought a wife with him she was called frances a thin pale woman with a frequent cough now that hindley was the master of the house he ordered joseph and me to spend our evenings in the small back kitchen as we were only servants while he his wife and catherine sat in the main room catherine and heathcliff were treated very differently catherine received presents and could continue her lessons but heathcliff was made to work on the farm with the men and as a farm worker was only allowed to eat with us in the backkitchen they grew up like two wild animals hindley did not care what they did as long as they kept out of his way and they did not care even if he punished them they often ran away on to the moors in the morning and stayed out all day just to make hindley angry i was the only one who cared what happened to the two poor creatures and i was afraid for them one sunday evening they were missing at bedtime and hindley ordered me angrily to lock the front door but i did not want them to stay out in the cold all night so i kept my window open to look out for them in a while i saw heathcliff walking through the gate i was shocked to see him alone where s catherine i cried sharply at thrushcross grange with our neighbours the lintons he replied let me in ellen and i ll explain what happened i went down to unlock the door and we came upstairs very quietly don t wake the master up i whispered now tell me well catherine and i thought we d just walk to the lintons house we wanted to see if isabella and edgar linton are punished all the time by their parents as we are probably not i answered i expect they are good children and don t need to be punished nonsense ellen guess what we saw when we looked in at their sittingroom window a very pretty room with soft carpets and white walls catherine and i would love to have a room like that but in the middle of this beautiful room isabella and edgar linton were screaming and fighting over a little dog how stupid they are ellen if catherine wanted something i would give it to her and she would do the same for me i would rather be here at wuthering heights with her even if i m punished by joseph and that wicked hindley that at thrushcross grange with those two fools not so loud heathcliff but you still haven t told me why catherine isn t with you well as we were looking in we started laughing at them so loudly that they heard us and sent the dogs after us we were about to run away when a great fierce dog caught catherine s leg in its teeth i attacked it and made it let go of her leg but the lintons servants appeared and caught hold of me they must have thought we were robbers catherine was carried unconscious into the house and they pulled me inside too all the time i was shouting and swearing at them what a wicked pair of thieves said old mr linton the boy must be a gipsy he s as dark as the devil mrs linton raised her hands in horror at the sight of me catherine opened her eyes and edgar looked closely at her mother he whispered the young lady is miss earn shaw of wuthering heights i ve seen her in church occasionally and look what our dog has done to her leg it s bleeding badly miss earnshaw with a gipsy cried mrs linton surely not but i think you must be right edgar this girl is wearing black and mr earnshaw died recently it must be her i d better put a bandage on her leg at once why does her brother hindley let her run around with such a companion wondered mr linton i remember now he s the gipsy child mr earnshaw brought home from liverpool a few years ago he s a wicked boy you can see that said mrs linton and did you hear the bad language he used just now i m shocked that my children heard it i was pushed out into the garden but i stayed to watch through the window they put catherine on a comfortable sofa cleaned her wound and fed her with cakes and wine i only left the house when i was sure she was well taken care of she s a breath of fresh air for those stupid lintons i m not surprised they like her everybody who sees her must love her mustn t they ellen i m afraid you ll be punished for this heathcliff i said sadly and i was right hindley warned heathcliff that he must never speak to catherine again or he would be sent away from wuthering heights and it was decided that catherine would be taught to behave like a young lady she stayed with the linton family at thrushcross grange for five weeks until christmas by that time her leg was fine and her manners were much better than before frances earn shaw visited her often bringing her pretty dresses to wear and persuading her to take care of her appearance so that when she finally came home after her long absence she almost seemed a different person instead of a wild hatless girl we saw a beautiful carefully dressed young lady when she had greeted all of us she asked for heathcliff come forward heathcliff called hindley you may welcome miss catherine home like the other servants heathcliff was used to being outside all day and had not bothered to wash or change his clothes his face and hands were black with dirt in spite of this catherine was very glad to see him and rushed up to kiss him then she laughed how funny and black and cross you look but that s because i m used to edgar and isabella who are always so clean and tidy well heathcliff have you forgotten me but ashamed and proud the boy said nothing until suddenly his feelings were too much for him i won t stay to be laughed at he cried and was about to run away when catherine caught hold of his hand why are you angry heathcliff you you just look a bit strange that s all you re so dirty she looked worriedly at her hands and her new dress you needn t have touched me he said pulling away his hand i like being dirty and i m going to be dirty as he ran miserably out of the room hindley and his wife laughed loudly delighted that their plan to separate the two young people seemed to be succeeding the next day was christmas day edgar and isabella linton had been invited to lunch and their mother had agreed on condition that her darlings were kept carefully apart from that wicked boy i felt sorry for poor heathcliff and while the earnshaws were at church i helped him wash and dress in clean clothes you re too proud i scolded him as i brushed his black hair you should think how sad catherine is when you can t be together and don t be jealous of edgar linton i wish i had blue eyes and fair hair like him i wish i behaved well and was going to inherit a fortune he has none of your intelligence or character and if you have a good heart you ll have a handsome face who knows who your parents were perhaps a king and queen far more important than the lintons in this way i encouraged heathcliff to have more confidence in himself but when the earnshaws and the lintons arrived back from church the first thing hindley did was shout at heathcliff get out of my sight until we ve finished eating i ll pull that long hair of yours if you don t obey me at once it is long said edgar i m surprised he can see anything this was too much for heathcliff he looked desperately around for a weapon picked up a bowl of hot soup and threw it at edgar who started screaming hindley immediately took hold of heathcliff and pushed him upstairs i m sure hindley s going to hit him cried catherine i hate it when heathcliff is punished it s your fault edgar you annoyed him why did you speak to him i didn t replied edgar tears in his eyes i promised mother i wouldn t i spoke about him not to him well don t cry said catherine with scorn you ve made enough trouble already here comes my brother hindley returned hot and breathless that ll teach him he said and now let s have lunch the others seemed to forget heathcliff but i noticed catherine could not eat much and i knew she was sorry for her friend in the evening there was music from a travelling band and dancing in the main room catherine said the music sounded sweeter from high up and so she went to sit in the dark on the stairs when i went to find her however i discovered she had gone right to the top of the house to talk to heathcliff through his locked bedroom door and had then climbed out on to the roof and in through his window i persuaded them both to come out of the room the same way as i had no key to the door and took heathcliff down into the warm servants kitchen with me while catherine returned to her guests and the dancing you must be hungry heathcliff i said you haven t eaten all day have some christmas cake do i can t eat anything he growled putting his head in his hands i ve got to think how i can have my revenge on hindley i only hope he doesn t die first he ll be sorry he s treated me like this ellen catherine and edgar in the summer of this year hindley s wife frances had her first and last baby they called the boy hareton but the poor woman had been ill for a long time although we had not realized it and died soon after hareton was born hindley only had room in his heart for two people himself and his wife so when she died he was in despair he neither cried nor prayed instead he swore at god and man and drank himself to sleep every night the servants all left him except for joseph and me joseph enjoyed being able to scold his wicked employer with warnings from the bible and i could not leave miss catherine after all i had grown up with her and hindley but the master s behaviour was a bad example for catherine and heathcliff at fifteen catherine was the most beautiful girl for miles around but she was proud and quick tempered she led what was almost a double life at wuthering heights under heathcliff s influence she annoyed hindley laughed at joseph and was rude to me but at thrushcross grange which she often visited she showed a different calmer side of her character and was polite intelligent and amusing the lintons all liked her and poor edgar had fallen in love with her heathcliff was sixteen at this time he did not have time to study any more and the long hours of work on the farm made him tired and dull there was always an angry expression on his face and he did not even try to keep himself clean and tidy he seemed to want people to dislike him catherine and he still spent time together when he was not working in the fields but he no longer expressed his fondness for her in words and he looked angry if she touched or kissed him one afternoon when hindley had gone into town heath cliff came into the main room after lunch i was helping catherine to arrange her hair as she had invited edgar linton to visit her while hindley was absent catherine are you going anywhere this afternoon asked heathcliff why have you got that silk dress on nobody s visiting you i hope no o i don t think so replied catherine looking quickly at me but you should be at work by now heathcliff that devil hindley isn t away very often i m taking a holiday i won t work any more today i m staying with you this afternoon he ll never know catherine thought for a moment somehow she had to prepare him for edgar s visit isabella and edgar said they might call here this afternoon if they come you ll be scolded for not working tell ellen to say you re busy and can t see them he said those friends of yours take up all your time you spend most of your evenings with them not with me well why should i always spend my time with you she asked crossly what can you talk about how can you amuse me you never told me before that you didn t like my company catherine cried heathcliff just then we heard a horse outside and there was a light knock on the door edgar linton entered his handsome face full of delight at receiving catherine s unexpected invitation i wondered if catherine was comparing her two friends as edgar came in and heathcliff ran out i haven t come too soon have i asked edgar politely no answered catherine leave us alone ellen i m just doing my work miss i replied pretending to dust the furniture hindley had told me to be present if edgar linton came to visit catherine she came up to me and whispered crossly go away ellen keeping her back to edgar she cruelly scratched my arm oh i screamed to show edgar what had happened what a wicked thing to do miss you have no right to hurt me i didn t touch you you lying creature she cried angrily and unable to control herself hit me hard on the face catherine love catherine cried edgar shocked the baby hareton who followed me everywhere immediately started sobbing and saying wicked aunt catherine she picked him up and shook the poor child until he screamed edgar rushed up to her and tried to stop her at once she turned and hit him over the ear as hard as she could the young man looked very pale and went straight to the door where are you going edgar linton she asked don t leave me i shall be miserable all night can i stay after you have hit me he replied you ve made me afraid and ashamed of you i won t come here again well go then if you want to she cried i m going to cry until i m ill and she dropped on to the floor her shoulders shaking and the tears rolling down her face edgar managed to get as far as the door but here he hesitated and i called out to him to encourage him to leave miss is just a selfish child sir you d better ride home and forget her but as he could not stop looking at her i knew there was no hopekfor him nothing would keep him away from her now and sure enough he came back into the room and shut the door this time i left them alone and stayed in the kitchen with little hareton but when i came to warn them that hindley had returned i realized that their quarrel had only brought them closer together heathcliff disappears hindley came into the kitchen swearing terribly just as i was about to hide little hareton in a cupboard i was always afraid that hindley would hurt his small son either by accident or on purpose when he was drunk so i tried to keep hareton out of the way but this time hindley discovered my plan ah you keep my son in a cupboard do you he cried angrily picking up a sharp kitchen knife with the devil s help i ll make you swallow this ellen and he pushed the knife between my teeth i was never afraid he would hurt me and calmly took the knife out of my mouth but that can t be my son can it he continued aggressively staring at the frightened littlebboy if it is he should be punished for not running to greet his father perhaps i ll cut his ears off and then suddenly his manner changed no hareton darling don t cry kiss me kiss your father what you won t then i ll break your neck poor hareton screaming wildly was carried upstairs by his father suddenly hindley stopped on the stairs to listen almost forgetting what he was holding heathcliff had come into the house and stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up just then the child jumped out of hindley s arms and fell i onlyhhad time to gasp inkhorror before i saw that heathcliff had caught him heathcliff stared down at the child he was holding he must have felt sorry he had saved the life of his enemy s son i rushed to take the poor little boy in my arms and hindley came slowly downstairs look what you ve done mr hindley i cried you nearly killed your own son what would his mother say if she were alive take him away ellen and you heathcliff go away too i won t murder you tonight unless perhaps i set the house on fire but that depends how i feel and he poured himself a drink don t drink any more mr hindley i begged what difference does it make he growled get out both of you to the devil with you we left him swearing at us and went back into the kitchen it s a pity he can t kill himself with drink muttered heathcliff dr kenneth says he ll live longer than any of us he s so strong he walked out of the door and i thought into the fields in fact i discovered later that he was sitting just under the window and could hear everything that was said in the kitchen i was singing little hareton to sleep when catherine came in are you alone ellen she whispered where s heath cliff he s out on the farm i answered she looked sad and worried and i even saw a tear or two on her face but i had not forgotten how she had lied and behaved so badly to me as well as to edgar linton so i did not feel sorry for her or encourage her to talk ellen will you keep a secret for me she asked in the end giving me her sweetest smile i must tell you i need your advice today edgar linton has asked me to marry him and i gave him an answer now before i tell you if it was yes or no you tell me which i should have said really miss catherine how can i know perhaps you should have refused him he must be a fool to ask you after you were so rude and violent this afternoon well i accepted him ellen she said crossly but should i have done so should i what do you think first do you love him i asked of course i do she replied why do you love him miss catherine well i do that s enough well because he s handsome and a pleasant companion oh that s bad i said shaking my head and because he loves me that s worse andhbecause he ll be rich and i shall be the most important woman for miles around worst of all but there are several other handsome rich young men in the world why don t you marry one of them i don t know any of them i only know edgar well i don t know why you re unhappy miss catherine your brother will be pleased and mr edgar s parents will too you love edgar and edgar loves you what s the problem here and here replied catherine beating her head and her chest in my heart and soul i know i m wrong ellen i can t live apart from heathcliff he is more myself than i am our souls are the same i have nothing in common with edgar but i can t marry heathcliff now hindley has made him become a poor dull farm worker he ll never know how i love him i suddenly heard a movement outside the window and saw heathcliff stand up and walk away i realized he had been listening until he heard catherine say she could not marry him then he stayed to hear no more quiet miss q catherine i said just imagine how hard it will be for heathcliff when you marry mr edgar he ll have no friends at all when you leave him leave him why should we be separated she asked angrily who will separate us nobody will dare edgar must learn to accept him as my friend didn t you ever think ellen that if heathcliff and i married we would be very poor but if i marry edgar i can help heathcliff with my husband s money that s the worst reason you ve given so far for marrying mr edgar i replied shocked it isn t heathcliff is more important to me than myself my love for edgar is like the leaves on the trees i m sure time will change it but my love for heathcliff is like the rocks in the ground not beautiful but necessary and unchanging he s always always in my heart just then joseph entered the kitchen i whispered to catherine that i was sure heathcliff had heard some of what she said she jumped up frightened and rushed outside but although we all looked everywhere for heathcliff there was no sign of him that night or for many nights in the future at about midnight while we were still waiting for him to come home we noticed the wind was getting stronger we could hear it whistling down the chimney and howling all around the house suddenly there was a terrible crash of thunder and the branch of a tree fell on to the roof we were not hurt but joseph immediately dropped on to his knees to pray the rain was beating down on the windows but catherine stayed outside although by now her hair and clothes were completely wet in the end we all went to bed i managed to persuade catherine to come in but she insisted on sleeping in the kitchen in case heathcliff returned during the night in the morning we discovered that she had caught a fever as a result of getting wet she became seriously ill and it was several weekshbefore dr kenneth would allow her out of bed when she recovered she was invited to stay for a while at thrushcross grange unfortunately old mr and mrs linton caught the fever too and died within a few days of each other catherine returned to us prouder and quicker tempered than ever but not as strong as before if she gets ill again it could be fatal dr kenneth warned us my advice to you is to do whatever she wants and don t make her angry so we had to obey all her orders and joseph and i were not allowed to scold her any more edgar linton was still in love with her and thought himself the happiest man on earth when he married her three years after his parents death she insisted on having me with her so we moved together to thrushcross grange although i was very sad to leave little hareton with his father it s very late mr lockwood i think you should go to bed or you ll be ill tomorrow i can tell you the rest of the story another time four weeks later in fact i was ill the next day and have been ill since then the terrible night i spent at wuthering height was the cause of my illness and i blame mr heathcliff for it dr kenneth has warned me i won t be able to go out until the spring all i can do is lie in bed listening to the howling wind and staring at the grey northern sky so i ve decided to ask mrs dean to come upstairs and finish telling me her story she tells me she s happy to continue heathcliff returns well sir when miss catherine became mrs linton and we went to live at thrushcross grange i must say i was surprised and pleased by her behaviour she showed great fondness for her husband and for his sister isabella he of course was very anxious that no one should disobey her or make her angry if she was depressed for a time he blamed it on the illness she had had and was sympathetic but for most of the time i believe they shared a deep and growing love for each other unfortunately this happiness did not last one evening i was bringing in a basket of apples from the garden when a voice behind me said ellen is that you it was a deep rather unusual voice i turned to see a tall dark man in the shadow near the kitchen door don t you know me he asked look i m not a stranger what i cried in surprise for it had been four years since he dusappeared heathcliff is it really you yes he replied looking up at the windows of the house are they at home where is she tell me ellen i must speak to her i m not sure if you should see her i hesitated will the shock be too much for her go and tell her i m here ellen he said impatiently don t make me suffer like this i left him at the door and went upstairs to find mr and mrs linton they were sitting quietly together looking out over the peaceful valley the room and the view and the two people seemed so calm that i did not want to disturb them but i had to deliver my message a man wants to see you madam i muttered i ll go downstairs and see him then replied catherine bring the tea up ellen while i m away she left the room who is it ellen asked mr edgar it s that heathcliff sir you remember he used to live at wuthering heights what the gipsy who worked on the farm he cried mrs linton would be angry if she heardpyou talking about him like that sir she was very upset when he ran away she s very fond of him you know mr edgar put his head out of the window and called to his wife don t stand there in the cold love bring the person in if it s anyone special catherine rushed upstairs and into the room wild and breathless she threw her arms round her husband s neck oh edgar darling heathcliff s come back well well said mr edgar crossly there s no need to get excited i know you didn t like him she said but please i beg you tobbe friends with him now shall i ask him to come up you re suggesting inviting him up here into our siting room don t you think the kitchen is more suitable for him catherine looked at her husband half angry and half laughing no she said i can t sit in the kitchen ellen bring two tables one for your master and miss isabella the other for heathcliff and myself we ll sit apart from them as we re of a lower class will that please you edgar darling decide quickly i must have him near me ellen you go and bring him up said mr edgar and catherine try not to behave foolishly remember he s only a servant when heathcliff entered the sitting room i was surprised to see how much he had changed he wore a confident intelligent expression on his face and his manner was no longer rough although i recognized the same black fire in his eyes the farm boy had become a gentleman mr edgar was as surprised as i was but welcomed heath cliff as politely as he could however he grew more and more annoyed as he watched his wife s delighted face she could not take her eyes off heathcliff tomorrow i won t be able tohbelieve that i ve seen and touched you heathcliff she cried catching hold of his hands but how cruel of you to run away and keep silent for four years and never think of me i ve thought of you more than you ve thought of me he replied quietly i heard you had married catherine and i came just to see you once and then take my revenge on your brother hindley your welcome may change my plans you know i ve had a bitter hard life since i last heard your voice and if i ve survived it s all because of you catherine said mr edgar trying to remain polite please pour out the tea or it will be cold mr heathcliff will have a long walk to wherever he s staying tonight and i m thirsty but catherine was too excited and mr edgar too angry to drink any tea after a while their guest left we discovered that he had been invited to stay at wuthering heights by hindley i could not understand why hindley who hated him would want his company and i felt sure it would have been better for all of us if heathcliff had never come back catherine could not keep her happiness to herself in the middle of the night she woke me to talk about heathcliff i just can t sleep ellen she said and edgar won t lis ten when i tell him how happy i am he s so selfish he never liked heathcliff i replied and he ll be angry if you go on talking about him you think he s weak but he could be as determined as you about something he thinks is important no she laughed i have such confidence in edgar s love that i think i could kill him and he wouldn t blame me for it he will have to learn to accept heathcliff as my friend do you know why heathcliff is staying at wuthering heights oh yes he explained that he went there to look for me hindley asked him to play cards and when he discovered heathcliff had a lot of money invited him to stay there you know how greedy my brother is he ll make heathcliff pay rent and hope to win money from him at cards heathcliff wants to stay there to be near me i m so happy ellen and i want everyone around me to be happy too catherine behaved so sweetly to her husband in the next few days that thrushcross grange seemed full of sunshine and in spite of his doubts mr edgar allowed heathcliff to visit her regularly however heathcliff s visits produced a result which none of us had expected isabella mr edgar s sister a pretty girl of eighteen suddenly declared that she was in love with heathcliff mr edgar who loved her dearly was shocked he knew that if he and catherine had no sons isabella would inherit the considerable linton fortune he did not like the idea of the fortune passing to heathcliff as isabella s husband but more importantly he suspected that heathcliff was hiding his ture wickedness under his gentleman ly appearance catherine tried hard to persuade isabella that heathcliff was not worth loving but poor isabella was jealous of catherine s relationship with heathcliff and would not listen finally catherine told heathcliff himself that isabella was in love with him she thought she knew what his answer would be how could i ever love that stupid girl he asked she has a miserable pale face and weak blue eyes just like your husband but she will inherit the family wealth from him won t she that s true replied catherine but don t think about that heathcliff i hope edgar and i will have several sons and then they will inherit it catherine did not speak of this matter again but i am sure heathcliff often thought about it i watched him carefully in the next few days i hoped he would do nothing to hurt mr edgar who was a kind master to me i was worried too about what was happening at wuthering heights hindley and his son hareton seemed like lost sheep to me and i knew there was a wicked wolf just waiting for the chance to attack them catherine is ill the next time heathcliff came to thrushcross grange he met isabella by chance in front of the house i was watching from the kitchen window as he went up to her and supposing that no one else could see him kissed her look madam i cried to catherine who was passing through the kitchen that devil heathcliff told you he could never love miss isabella and now he s kissing her sohwhen heathcliff entered the house catherine was ready to scold him leave isabella alone heathcliff she ordered you ll make edgar angry you think i m afraid of that weak little creature he growled anyway what difference does it make to you i can kiss her if she likes it i m not your husband you needn t be jealous of me i m not jealous of you replied catherine if you like isabella you can marry her but do you like her it s you i want to talk about catherine you know you ve treated me badly and i m going to have my revenge thank you for telling me isabella s secret i swear i ll make good use of it at this point i went to look for my master and told him that catherine and heathcliff were quarrelling in the kitchen how can my wife call that man a friend he cried angrily i ve been too weak with her i can t allow him to visit her any more call two servants ellen he went to the kitchen i followed him telling the servants to wait in the hall catherine said mr edgar to his wife as he entered do you think it s right to listen to this wicked man s talk have you been listening at the door edgar asked catherine coldly heathcliff laughed which made mr edgar even angrier you sir he said to heathcliff are poisoning our family life i should never have accepted you as catherine s friend i must inform you that you will never be allowed to enter this house again and that if you don t leave within three minutes you will be thrown out well well replied heathcliff looking scornfully at mr edgar s small figure so you re going to throw me out your self are you my master looked towards the door i realized he wanted to call the servants as he knew he was not strong enough to fight heathcliff alone but catherine must have guessed his plan she hurried to the door and locked it mr edgar looked at her in angry surprise you must fight him like a gentleman without anyone to help you she told her husband that ll teach you to scold me mr edgar tried to get hold of the key but she threw it quickly into the hottest part of the fire he went very pale and could not stop his whole body trembling oh edgar cried his wife you ve lost the fight already you aren t a man you re a mouse so that said heathcliff pointing at mrledgar is the thing you preferred to me catherine is he crying or is he goingito die of fear he went up to look more closely at mr edgar who suddenly recovered and hit heathcliff hard on the neck while heath cliff was getting his breath back mr edgar walked out of the other kitchen door into the garden now you ll never be able to come here again said cather ine to heathcliff go away quickly he ll return with men and guns heathcliff was sensible enough to take her advice he broke down the locked door and escaped just as the master and his men returned catherine who was over excited ordered me to go upstairs with her i hoped she would not discover that i had told mr edgar about her quarrel with heathcliff i m wild with anger ellen she said when we reached the sittingroom all this trouble is because of isabella tell edgar i m in danger ofhbecoming seriously ill i hope it s true i want to frighten him he s upset me badly why did he lis ten to us talking in the kitchen heathcliff says wicked things but i know i can control him well if i can t have heathcliff as my friend if edgar is going to be mean and jealous i ll try to break both their hearts by breaking my own you must re mind edgar how quick tempered i am and what dr kenneth said about my health edgar must let me do what i want i did not feel sympathetic towards catherine and certainly did not want to frighten my poor master by telling him she was ill as i was leaving the room however he entered catherine he said you must tell me one thing you must choose between me and heathcliff which do you intend to have leave me alone she cried wildly i m ill can t you see i can t even stand edgar leave me she fell stiff and pale on to the floor mr edgar looked very frightened don t worry sir i whispered to him she told me she would try to make you afraid by pretending to be ill unfortunately she heard me she jumped up her hair loose and her eyes staring and rushed to her bedroom we heard the key turn in the lock for the next few days she refused to speak to anyone even me i took her food up to her room but she would not eat mr edgar spent his time in the library and did not ask about his wife he hoped i suppose that she would come and ask him to forgive her but i knew she was too proud to do that on the third day she unlocked her door and called me she ate and drank eagerly then lay down again oh why don t i die since no one cares about me she muttered edgar doesn t love me at all what is he doing all this time ellen he s reading mbooks in the library madam i answered reading books she cried shocked and i m dying up here my god does he know how i ve changed how ill i am can t you tell him i m seriously ill ellen you forget mrs linton that you ve eaten tonight i m sure you ll feel better tomorrow morning i still wanted to make her realize how selfish she was being although i was a little worried by her pale almost ghostly face i begin to see that you don t like me ellen how strange i always thought everybody loved me now they are all my enemies isabella and edgar and you i ll die with cold faces around me i ve had terrible dreams these past few nights you know open the window ellen i m so hot i refused as it was the middle of winter she was feverish who is that over there she asked staring at her own face in a mirror opposite her bed i could not make her under stand it was herself and i began to be afraid that her illness was real stay with me ellen she cried holding my hand i m frightened of that face i m frightened of being alone i wish i were in my bed at wuthering heights with the wind howling through the trees do let me feel a breath of air from the moors just one breath i opened the window for a moment then closed it the cold air seemed to calm her i wish i were a young girl again wild and free out on the moors with heathcliff open the window again wider this time why won t you because i don t want you to die of cold i replied but it s my only chance of life she cried jumping out of bed and going to the window i tried to force her back to bed but her fever made her surprisingly strong we looked out together into the icy darkness there was no moon and no lights were visible anywhere but catherine was sure she could see wuthering heights look she said there s my old home and the church yard near it i won t lie there alone heathcilff i won t rest until you re in the grave with me i was still holding her back from the window and wondering what to do next when mr edgar entered please help sir i called mrs linton is ill catherine s ill he gasped shut the window ellen catherine why when he saw his wife s face he was so shocked that he stopped speaking and stared at her in horror she was almost unconscious and did not recognize him at first ah it s you is it edgar linton she said after a few moments you don t come when you re wanted and now you come when you re not wanted but whatever you say nothing can keep me from my home my place of rest out there in the open air with a gravestone at my head she s feverish sir and doesn t know what she s saying i whispered if she has food and rest she ll recover i want no further advice from you ellen dean said mr edgar coldly you knew how ill she was and you didn t tell me i ran downstairs and out of the kitchen door to fetch the doctor i thought i heard the sound of horses in the distance which seemed strange at two o clock in the morning and when i found dr kenneth he told me someone had seen isabella and heathcliff meeting secretly in the garden earlier that evening that night none of us slept we all sat together and waited while the doctor stayed with his patient he told us he hoped that catherine would recover if we kept her very quiet in the morning we discovered that isabella s room was empty she had run away with heathcliff when mr edgar heard the news he just said she chose to go with him don t speak to me of her again i no longer think of her as my sister isabella s story for two months we heard nothing of isabella or heathcliff during that time catherine was dangerously ill with brain fever andhdr kenneth warned us that even if she recovered her brain would never return to normal how ever she did seem to get better and no one could have been happier than my master when he saw her sitting up in bed for the first time and beginning to take an interest in the people and things around her he loved her so much and took such good care of her that i really thought she would recover there was another reason for her to live she was expecting a baby and we all hoped she would have a son who would inherit the linton fortune then mr edgar received a letter from isabella telling him that she and heathcliff were married with it was a long letter for me which said wuthering heights dear ellen i arrived here last night and heard that catherine brother refuses to write to me so you are the only one i can write to tell edgar i still love him and catherine and want to return to thrushcross grange but i can t the rest of this letter is for you alone ellen two questions how did you manage to get on with the people in this house thay don t seem human and this interests me very much what is mr heathcliff a man a madman a devil when you come to visit me you must explain to me what sort of creature i ve married and you must come very soon with a message from edgar heathcliff brought me here last night this house is going to be my home he says he disappeared as soon as we arrived so i entered the kitchen alone what a miserable depressing place it is now ellen by the fire stood a dirty child i realized he must be catherine s nephew hareton and tried to shake his hand but he greeted me by swearing at me so i went into the hall to find somebody else when i knocked at another door it was opened by a tall thin man with long dirty hair hanging down to his shoulders i knew this must be hindley earnshaw catherine s brother and hareton s father his eyes and hareton s reminded me of catherine what do you want he asked roughly my name was isabella linton i replied now i m married to mr heathcliff ah so that devil has returned good he growled you can imagine ellen how unhappy i felt in that unpleasant house i knew that only four miles away was my real home thrushcross grange containing the only people i loved in the world but those four miles were like an ocean which i could not cross don t tell edgar or catherine this but i had hoped to find a friend at wuthering heights some one to support me against heathcliff now i realized that no one here would help me after a long silence i said please ask a maid to show me my bedroom i m tired after my journey we have no maids here he answered joseph will show you heathcliff s room if you like and and you d better lock the bedroom door tonight why mr earnshaw i asked i did not want to lock myself in with heathcliff he brought out a gun which had a knife attached to it look at this he said every night i try to open his bed room door up to now he s locked it but one night he ll forget and then i ll kill him why do you hate him so much i asked because he s taken everything from me he shouted angrily there s nothing left for hareton to inherit but i m going to get it all back and his money too and then his blood then the devil can have his soul he seemed mad to me ellen i left him and went to find the old servant joseph it seemed that heathcliff s room was locked and there were no guest bedrooms so in the end i slept on a chair in the child s room what a welcome to my new home i know heathcliff blames edgar forqcatherine s illness he has warned me he ll make me suffer for it oh i do hate him i m so miserable i ve been such a fool don t tell any one at thrushcross grange about this ellen come quickly don t disappoint me isabella as soon as i had read this i asked mr edgar if i could take a message from him to his sister you may visit her this afternoon ellen if you like tell her i m not angry just sorry to have lost her i can t imagine she will ever be happy i shall never visit her or write to her when i arrived at wuthering heights that afternoon i was shocked to see how much worse the house looked than when i used to live there i realized that hindley did not care what conditions he lived in and joseph clearly spent more time praying than cleaning heathcliff and isabella were both in the main room heathcliff looked more like a gentleman than i had ever seen him but his wife had not bothered to brush her hair or change her dress i had to explain to poor isabella that mr edgar had refused to write to her she cried a little when she heard that then heathcliff asked me question after question about catherine s illness if you really love her i told him you ll keep away from her now she mustn t be over excited her health will always be weak and her loving husband is a very good nurse to her her loving husband repeated heathcliff scornfully don t compare my feeling for her with his no ellen before you leave this house i ll make you promise to arrange a meeting for me with catherine i must see her i ll never agree to that i said she s just beginning to recover she s almost forgotten you and now you want to upset her again ellen you know as well as i do that she can never forget me if she thinks once of edgar linton she thinks a thousand times of me he can t love her as i can and catherine has a heart as deep as mine catherine and edgar are very fond of each other said isabella suddenly don t speak of my brother like that your dear brother doesn t care enough abut you to write to you replied heathcliff smiling sourly that s because be doesn t know how much i ve suffered she answered quietly turning away to hide the tears on her face sir i said it seems to me that miss isabella mrs heathcliff i should say is unhappy you must treat her kindly try to look after her let her have a maid for example i m not going to be soft with her he repliedd with a laugh she was stupid enough to run away with me i never pretended to love her now i think she s beginning to realize that i scorn her she s an even weaker fool than her brother but she s going to be useful to me that s why i m keeping her with me ellen he says he married me to have his revenge on edgar but i won t let him carry out his plan whatever it is i ll die or i ll see him dead first you re getting violent isabella said heathcliff go upstairs now i want to speak to ellen dean in private go on and he pushed her roughly out of the door don t you feel pity for her i asked when we were alone have you ever felt pity for anybody in your life why should i she s just like an insect under my foot the more she cries the more i enjoy hurting her now ellen lis ten i ll wait every day and every evening in the grange garden until i find a chance to see catherine if i meet edgar linton or his servants i ll shoot them but don t you think it d be better to avoid a fight you could tell me when she ll be alone then there ll be no violence i argued and complained and refused fifty times but in the end he forced me to agree i promised to let him know when edgar linton was away from home i suppose it was wrong of me but i hoped it would be heathcliff s last meeting with catherine heathcliff visits catherine for the last time heathcliff had given me a letter for catherine but i decided not to show it to her until mr edgar was out of the house my chance came four days after my visit to wuthering heights as it was a sunday mr edgar and all the servants went to church leaving me alone to look after catherine she was sitting downstairs by an open window enjoying the spring sunshine her appearance had changed since her illness but there was a strange beauty in her pale face she did not read or sew any more but used to sit there silently staring into the distance her eyes seemed fixed on something far away something beyond normal sight i showed her the letter but she looked confused and could not seem to understand it so i had to explain it s from mr heathcliff i said gently he s in the garden and wants to see you what shall i tell him she said nothing but bent forward in her chair to listen we both heard someone coming through the hall heathcliff had realized the house was almost empty and had found an open door catherine looked eagerly towards the entrance to the room he appeared and in two steps was by her side for five whole minutes he held her in his arms and kissed her again and again it gave him great pain to look at her face he could see as i could that she would never recover that she was certain to die oh catherine oh my life how can i bear it he cried you and edgar have broken my heart said catherine and you both want me to pity yoy how strong you are heathcliff you ll live for years after my death will you forget me and be happy with others when i m in my grave it s wicked of you to say that catherine you know your words will burn for ever in my memory after you ve left me you know i could never forget you i don t want you to suffer more than i do heathcliff i only want us to be together always heathcliff turned away his shoulders shaking that isn t my heathcliff catherine said to me i ll always love my heathcliff and take him with me he s in my soul you see oh ellen i do want to escape from this prison there s a beautiful world waiting for me out there you feel sorry for me now because i m ill well very soon i ll feel sorry for you because i ll be beyond you all heathcliff turned towards her his fierce eyes wet for a moment they looked at each other and then they were in each other s arms again no one could have separated them how cruel you ve been to me catherine he cried wildly you loved me so why did you marry edgar linton it s all your fault i haven t broken your heart you ve broken it and you ve broken mine too do you think i want to live after you are dead if i ve done wrong i m dying for it sobbed catherine it s your fault too heathcliff you left me remember but i forgive you now forgive me it s hard to forgive when i look at your sad eyes and feel your thin hands kiss me again catherine i forgive you for making me suffer but how can i forgive you for dying catherine sobbed quietly hiding her face in his shoulder and tears rolled down heathcliff s dark face suddenly i noticed through the window the servants coming back from church i was afraid mr edgar would find heathcliff with catherine my master will be here in a moment i warned them i must go catherine said heathcliff no no she screamed den t go it s the last time edgar won t hurt us heathcliff i ll die if you go all right my darling i ll stay if he shot me in your arms i d die happy at that moment my master appeared at the door when he saw heathcliff holding his wife he went pale with anger here take care of her first said heathcliff putting catherine in her husband s arms then speak to me later if you wish he walked out of the house catherine seemed to be unconscious and mr edgar was so worried about her that he forgot about heathcliff for the moment she recovered a little but did not recognize any of us and was clearly very ill we put her to bed immediately and at twelve o clock that night her daughter cathy was born two months early that s the young lady you saw at wuthering heights mr lockwood two hours later catherine died without calling for heathcliff or recognizing edgar my poor master was in the depths of despair i thought it was very unfortunate that catherine had only given him a daughter not a son now the linton fortune would pass to isabella and her husband after mr edgar s death catherine s dead body lay peacefully on her bed in death she looked more beautiful that in life i wondered if she was now beyond us all as she had said and hoped that her soul had found a home with god in the morning i went to look for heathcliff i found him in the grange garden where he had been waiting for news all night she s dead i know he caned to me as i came closer don t cry she doesn t need your tears tell me tell me how did he tried to say her name but could not manage it how did she die he said at last staring fiercely at me don t be sorry for me i don t want your pity poor creature i thought you have a heart just like other men but you are too proud to show it aloud i said she died quietly in her sleep her life finished in a gentle dream i hope she wakes as calmly in the other world where are you catherine he cried in despair don t leave me here where i can t find you i pray that you will never rest while i m alive you said i killed you haunt me then murdered people do haunt their murderers i believe come back as a ghost drive me mad i don t care oh god i can t bear it i cannot live without you my soul he howled like a wild animal and hit his forehead several times against a tree until the wood was covered in blood i knew i could no longer help him so i left him catherine was buried the following friday her brother hindley although invited did not come and isabella was not invited so it was only mr edgar and the servants who attended the ceremony to our surprise she was not buried in the church with the lintons nor with the earnshaws she lies in an open corner of the churchyard where she can breather the air from the moors her husband s grave is next to hers isabella escapes that friday evening the wind changed and brought first rain then snow next morning the spring flowers were all hidden under deep snow mr edgar stayed in his room i was in the sitting room with the baby when i was surprised to hear a girl s voice behind me i turned round and saw it was isabella heathcliff i was quite shocked by her appearance her hair was loose and wet with snow and rain she wore a light silk dress and thin shoes which did not seem at all suitable for a long walk in the snow under her ear was a deep wound which was bleeding her face was scratched and bruised and she looked very tired i could see that she was expecting a baby i ve run all the way here from wuthering heights she said gasping for breath i couldn t count how many times i ve fallen down ellen please ask a maid to find some dry clothes for me and then i ll go on to the village i m not staying here first my dear young lady i told her you ll get warm and dry and i ll put a bandage on that wound then we ll have some tea she was so exhausted that she let me help her without protesting and finally we sat down together near the fire with our cups of tea oh ellen she said i cried bitterly when i heard of catherine s death you know and heathcliff is desperately sad but i can t feel sorry for him this is the last thing of his i ve got and she took off her gold wedding ring and threw it in the fire i ll never go back to him but i can t stay here in case he comes to find me and anyway i don t want to beg for edgar s help or make trouble for him to escape from heathcliff i must go a long way away how could catherine have liked him ellen i wish he would die and then i could forget him completely don t say that i protested he s a human being there are worse men than him in the world he isn t human she replied i gave him my heart and he destroyed it so i can t feel pity for him but i must tell you how i managed to escape hindley earnshaw should have been at catherine s burial yesterday but he had been drinking so much that he couldn t go last night he and i were sitting silently in the kitchen at about midnight when heathcliff came home hindley decided to lock the doors so that heathcliff could not get in he told me his plan was to murder his hated guest that night with the weapon he had shown me i hate heathcliff too but i could not agree to murder so i called out a warning from the kitchen window heathcliff swore horribly at me and broke one of the windows hindley put his right arm out through the hole with the gun in it and aimed it at his enemy but before he could fire heathcliff caught hold of the gun and pulled it away from hindley the knife cut into hindley s wrist and blood poured out heathcliff jumped into the kitchen through the window and started kicking and hitting hindley who was lying unconscious on the kitchen floor i ran off to find joseph when we came back heathcliff was putting a bandage on hindley s wrist joseph was shocked at the sight of his master and would have gone to the police if heathcliff hadn t forced me to describe what happened i had to agree that hindley had certainly attacked heathcliff first the next day i decided to have my revenge on heathcliff by telling hindley that that devil had hit and kicked him when he was unconscious and i told heathcliff to his face that he could never have made catherine happy if she had been his wife this made him so angry that he threw a knife at me which cut my neck and then he rushed towards me swearing violently i knew i had to get away quickly and as i ran out of the kitchen i saw hindley attack heathcliff both of them were rolling on the floor fighting i came over the moors through the snow to the grange at last i m free and i shall never never spend another night at wuthering heights after drinking her tea isabella left the grange from our village she travelled by coach to the south where she made her new home near london there a few months later she had a son she called him linton heathcliff must have discovered this from the servants one day when i saw him in the village he said i hear i ve got a son ellen whose name s linton i suppose isabella wants me to hate him she can keep him for the moment but tell edgar linton i ll have the boy one day he s mine after catherine s death my poor master mr edgar was a changed man he no longer went to church or saw any friends he occasionally went for lonely walks on the moors and regularly visited his wife s grave but fortunately catherine had left him something of herself her daughter cathy this tiny child soon won his heart it s strange mr lockwood to compare hindley and edgar they both lost their wives and were left with a child hindley did not believe in god and showed no interest in his son hareton but edgar believed and loved his daughter cathy deeply hindley himself died six months after his sister catherine we never discovered exactly what happened but heathcliff said he had drunk himself to death it appeared that heathcliff had won hindley s house land and money from him when playing cards so he was now the master of wuthering heights hareton inherited nothing from his father and could only stay on at wuthering heights as a servant working for the man who had been his father s enemy bringing up cathy during the next twelve years i was happier than i had ever been before all my time was spent looking after little cathy who brought sunshine into our lives she was a real beauty with the earnshaws dark eyes and the lintons fair skin she wasn t as proud and quick tempered as her mother but she was used to getting what she wanted her father loved her so much that he gave her everything and never scolded her until she was thirteen she had never been outside the grange garden alone she knew nothing of wuthering heights or heathcliff she often asked me about the hills in the distance beyond the moors and wanted to ride her pony there i knew the master would not let her leave the safety of the grange to go so far especially as the road to the hills passed close to wuthering heights so i always told her she would be able to go there when she was older i did not know what she was planning mr edgar received a letter from his sister isabella she wrote that she was dying of a fever and asked him to visit her for the first and last time she also wanted him to take care of her son linton after her death although my master hated travelling he did not hesitate to do as she requested he told me to look after cathy carefully and left at once he was away for three weeks cathy did not cause me any trouble at first she spent her days walking her dogs and riding her pony in the large garden but one day she asked if she could stay out the whole day and away she went on her little pony with her two dogs running behind there was no sign of her at tea time and i began to be seriously worried i went outside to look for her at the gate i found a workman who had seen her jump the low wall separating the garden from the road and then ride on towards the hills and wuthering heights i was very frightened now she could be lost on the moors she could have tried to climb the hills and fallen i walked across the moors as fast as i could and arrived breathless at wuthering heights how glad i was to see one of her dogs lying outside the kitchen door i knocked loudly and zillah let me in i knew she had been the housekeeper there since hindley s death ah she said you ve come for your little mistress she s here quite safe the master mr heathcliff isn t here he won t be back for a while cathy was sitting comfortably in the kitchen talking eagerly to hareton he was now a big strong young man of eighteen who was staring rather stupidly at her i was delighted to find her again but i pretended to be angry to punish her well miss you are wicked going such a long way all alone i ve been all over the moors looking for you looking father will be angry what have i done she sobbed suddenly frightened father didn t forbid me to leave the grange garden he won t scold me ellen he s never cross like you and i ve been to the hills ellen this man showed me because i didn t know the way i made her put on her hat and prepare to leave whose house is this she asked suddenly it s your father s isn t it she added turming to hareton no he replied looking down his face went very red whose then your master s she asked he swore and turned away ellen he didn t say miss to me servants should always say miss shouldn t they hareton frowned and looked very angry but said nothing you get my horse she ordered him hurry what the devil do you mean i m not your servant he growled you see miss cathy nice words to be used to a young lady now come along let s fetch the pony and leave i said but ellen she cried staring horrified at him how dare he speak to me like that he must do as i tell him he s not your servant miss said zillah who had been listening to the conversation he s your cousin he can t be my cousin cried cathy with a scornful laugh father has gone to fetch my cousin from london he s a gentleman s son not not a farm worker like him she pointed at poor hareton whose clothes were old and dirty i was very annoyed with her and zillah now heathcliff would hear about his son s arrival which we had hoped to keep secret from him and cathy would certainly ask her father whether she had a cousin at wuthering heights on our way home i explained to her that if her father discovered she had visited wuthering heights he would perhaps be so angry with me that he would send me away she could not bear to think of that so she promised to keep her visit a secret from him we heard from mr edgar that his sister had died and that he was returning soon with his young nephew cathy was wild with excitement she would see her dear father again and have a cousin of the same age to play with but when the coach arrived young linton had to be carried into the house he was a pale thin boy who looked very like mr edgar he seemed so weak that i wondered how long he would live i thought he would have no chance of life if his father heathcliff took him to live at wuthering heights in fact linton only stayed one night with us later that evening heathcliff s servant joseph arrived and asked to speak to the master although it was late and mr edgar was tired after his journey joseph insisted so i took him to the master s room heathcliff has sent me for his son and i can t go back without him he said mr edgar was silent for a moment on his face was an expression of deep sadness he had hoped to keep linton with him as isabella had wished but he could not refuse the boy s father tell mr heathcliff he said calmly that ellen will take his son to wuthering heights tomorrow he s asleep at the moment and i won t disturb him no said joseph banging the table with his hand i must take him back now not tonight answered mr edgar leave the house now and tell your master what i said very well shouted joseph as he walked out if he doesn t arrive early in the morning heathcliff will come for him heathcliff s son at wuthering heights linton was very surprised to be woken so early and told that he had another journey to make before break fast as we rode the four miles to wuthering heights he kept asking me questions abut his new home and the father he had never seen when we arrived heathcliff hareton and joseph all came out of the house to inspect the child master that s not a boy said joseph after a while look at that white skin and fair hair mr edgar s sent you his daughter instead god what a beautiful creature laughed heathcliff scornfully that s worse than i expected i helped the trembling child off the horse and into the house heathcliff took him roughly by the arm i hope you ll be kind to him mr heathcliff i said he s weak and ill and he s all the family you ve go don t worry ellen replied heathcliff with a smile as isabella s son he ll inherit thrushcross grange one day and i don t want him to die before that he ll be educated as a gentleman but i m bitterly disappointed at having such a weak crying baby for a son so poor linton was left in his father s care at first cathy was miserable because she would not now have anyone to play with but she soon forgot him whenever i met zillah the housekeeper in the village i used to ask her abut linton he s often ill she told me and so selfish he has to have a fire even in summer he calls for cakes and hot drinks all the time he only ever thinks of himself mr heathcliff can t bear being in the same room as him several years passed without any more news of linton in cathy reached the age of sixteen we never celebrated her birthday because it was also the day her mother died on this particular day she came downstairs dressed for going out and suggested a walk on the moors with me her father gave permission it was a lovely spring morning and i was very happy walking in the sunshine watching cathy running ahead of me but we had walked further than i had realized and i called to her to come back she did not seem to hear me we were on the moors close to wuthering heights when i caught sight of two men talking to her i recognized heathcliff and hareton at once i hurried to catch up with her miss cathy i said breathlessly we must go home your father will be getting worried no he won t ellen this gentleman wants me to go to his house and meet his son he says we ve already met but i don t remember do you let s go ellen although i protested she and hareton were already halfway to wuthering heights heathcliff and i followed behind it s very bad of you mr heathcliff i scolded him mr edgar will blame me for letting her go to your house i want her to see linton ellke he re led listen to my plan it s really a very generous one i want the two cousins to fall in love and marry you know cathy won t inherit anything from her father my son linton will inherit all the linton fortune when edgar dies if she marries linton she ll be wealthy of course if linton dies then the money comes to me as his only other relation i was still angry with heathcliff but it was too late to stop cathy entering wuthering heights she was delighted to rediscover her cousin linton who was keeping warm by the fire if he is my cousin and you are his father she said to heathcliff smiling then you must be my uncle why don t you ever visit us at the grange i visited it once or twice too often before you were born he said i must tell you that i quarrelled violently with your father once he hates me and if you tell him you want to come here he ll forbid it well if i can t come here linton can come to visit me at the grange suggested cathy happily it ll be too far for me said her cousin weakly it would kill me to walk four miles heathcliff looked scornfully at his son i don t think my plan will ever succeed ellen he whispered to me who would fall in love with a selfish baby like that he went to the kitchen door and called hareton come and take miss cathy round the farm cathy was eager to see the animals and she and hareton went out as we watched them through the kitchen window heathcliff seemed to be thinking aloud i ve taken my revenge on his father by making hareton work for me i treat him badly as they used to do to me and he suffers as i used to he s intelligent and strong and handsome but i ve taught him to scorn those qualities so now he s just an uneducated farm worker and knows nothing of the world that s how he ll always be and my son he s stupid and weak and ill but he s gentleman and he ll marry cathy and he ll be rich meanwhile linton had got up from his armchair and gone out to join cathy and hareton through the open window i could hear the two younger ones laughing at hareton s coarse way of speaking i began to disliker linton rather than pity him when we arrived back at the grange cathy told her fathter about the visit he did not want to frighten her and in my opinion did not explain clearly enough why she should never communicate with linton again at the time she seemed to accept her father s wish during the next few weeks however i noticed cathy s behaviour change she was always writing on little pieces of paper which she kept in a locked drawer in her room and every morning she got up surprisingly early to go down to the kitchen i suspected something and day i decided to break open her drawer in it i was horrified to find a whole pile of love letters from linton the two cousins had been writing to each other in secret for several weeks and cathy had used the milkman as a messenger i told her at once that i knew her secret and made her promise not to send or receive any more letters we burnt linton s letters together secret visits the months passed and soon it was autumn mr edgar caught a bad cold which seemed to get worse and worse he stayed indoors the whole winter so cathy only had me as a companion on her walks she had become very quiet and sad since her relationship with linton had ended and was very worried about her father s illness one day when we were walking in the grange garden i noticed her crying cathy what s the matter love i ashed oh ellen she sobbed what shall i do if father dies and if you die i ll be left alone i hope he and i have years more of life ahead of us all you need do is look after your father and let him see you re cheerful but i think he would be really ill if he thought you loved linton whose father would like to see mr edgar dead i ll never never do anything to worry or annoy father she promised i only want him to recover i love him more than anyone else in the world more than myself just then we reached the gate and i saw a gentleman on a horse looking over it it was heathcliff miss linton he called there s something i must tell you i won t listen answered cathy father and ellen both say you re a wicked man but this is about my son linton not me what a trick you played on him you wrote him all those love letters and then i suppose you got tired of it and stopped well you ve broken poor linton s heart i swear he s dying of love for you and he ll be in the grave by next summer unless you help him be generous come and visit him i ll be away all next week so your father won t be angry if you come he rode away although i tried to persuade cathy that heathcliff could not be telling the truth my young mistress was very upset and determined to discover how linton was the next morning we rode to wuthering heights we found linton alone lying on a sofa he looked feverish and ill and had a bad cough will you shut the door he said crossly as we entered it s so cold no cathy i can t breathe if you kiss me i want a drink cathy poured him a glass of water and are you glad to see me linton she asked hopefully yes i am he replied but you should have come before my father swore at me and said it was my fault you didn t come will you come and visit me again yes linton cathy said gently holding his hand if father agreed i d spend half my time with you i wish you were my brother then we could spend all our time together but my father says you would love me best if you were my wife so that would be better i d never love anybody more than father she replied seriously sometimes men hate their wives like your father he hated your mother my aunt isabella that s why she left him that s not true cried the boy anyway your mother hated your father and she loved mine you re lying i hate you she shouted angrily and gave the sofa a violent push he fell back and started coughing so badly that even i was frightened at last he recovered cathy was crying in a comer afraid that she had really hurt him how do you feel now linton she asked after a while i m sorry i didn t mean to hurt you i wish you felt as ill as i do you cruel thing and i was better today before you came his voice was full of pity for himself we must go i said you can soe miss cathy that he isn t dying of love for you it s not your fault that he s ill come along but i could not stop cathy whispering something in linton s ear before we left the room on the way home i told her i would not allow her to visit him again he s a selfish child miss cathy and i don t think he ll live till he s twenty i m glad you re not going to marry him cathy looked sad i m sure he d recover if i looked after him and i don t think we d quarrel if we knew each other better well miss if you try to go there again with or without me i ll tell your father but the next day i fell ill and had to stay in bed for three weeks which was very unusual for me my little mistress went from her father s bedroom to mine and back again and looked after us both with the greatest care but i never wondered what she did in the evenings when mr edgar had gone to bed and i no longer needed her i only discovered the truth on the first day i was able to get up in the evening i asked her to read to me and was surprised how sleepy she seemed she went to bed early i felt rather worried about her health and went to her room an hour later to see if she needed anything her bedroom was empty i sat there in the dark waiting for her to return when she arrived shaking the snow off her shoes she was shocked to find me there i guessed where she had been but i made her tell me the whole story every night since i had been ill she had ridden to wuthering heights and spent the evening with her cousin sometimes she was happy with linton when he was cheerful and less selfish but most of the time she was miserable however she insisted that the visits should continue because linton needed her and she wanted to see him although she begged me to say nothing to her father i went straight to the master and told him he forbade her to visit wuthering heights again she had to obey her father although it made her very sad well mr lockwood all this happened only about a year ago i never thought i would be telling a stranger this story but who knows how long you ll be a stranger you re too young to live alone for long and no one could see cathy and not love her anyway i ll continue my story a trap a few days after the master had forbidden cathy to visit linton he asked my opinion of the boy tell me honestly ellen what do you think of his character well sir i don t think he s wicked like his father but you ll have plenty of time to get to know him sir he s too young to marry yet mr edgar walked to the window and looked out it was a misty february evening but the churchyard was just visible i ve often prayed for death ellen i ve been very happy with my little cathy but i ve been just as happy lying through the long june evenings on her mother s grave and looking forward to the moment when i can join catherine there i haven t got much time left ellen what can i do for cathy before i die should she marry linton i wouldn t mind him being heathcliff s son if only he loved her and could be a good husband to her god will show us what to do sir i replied in the spring mr edgar was still ill and he continued to worry about cathy s future one day he wrote to linton inviting him to visit the grange linton wrote a long letter back explaining that his father would not allow him to do that he begged his uncle to let him meet cathy for a walk or a ride on the moors between the grange and wuthering heights as they could not meet in either house mr edgar refused at first and linton sent him several more letters i am sure they had all been carefully checked by heathcliff before they were posted finally mr edgar agreed he hoped that if cathy married linton who would inherit the linton fortune she would at least be able to remain in her family home he had no idea that linton was seriously ill neither did i i never imagined that a father could treat a dying child as cruelly and wickedly as we later discovered heathcliff had done it was a hot sunny day in summer when cathy and i rode out to meet her cousin we were both shocked to discover that he could neither ride nor walk and was lying on the grass waiting for us he looked even paler and weaker than the last time i had seen him during our meeting he did not seem interested in cathy or her news cathy noticed this immediately well linton she said after a while you don t want to talk to me so i think i ll go home no no he cried getting quite excited not yet stay at least another half hour my father will be angry with me if you leave early i suppose we can stay a few minutes longer said cathy we waited talking to each other quietly while linton slept a little sometimes he cried out in pain do you think his health is better now than before whispered cathy i m sorry miss cathy i think it s much worse i answered cathy called her pony and the sound woke linton up if you see my father he said hesitating could you tell him i ve been cheerful he ll be here soon and he looked round in terror i ll be here next thursday cried cathy as she jumped on her pony come on ellen in the week that followed mr edgar s illness grew worse every day cathy could not avoid realizing how serious it was and sat by his bedside day and night looking sad and pale her father s room had become her whole world on thursday i thought a ride in the fresh air would be good for her and mr edgar gladly gave her permission to see linton he was hoping that she would not be left alone after his death i did not want to worry him in his last moments so i did not tell him that linton was also dying we rode on to the moors and found linton lying in the same place as before he was looking very frightened i thought you weren t going to come he said why won t you be honest cried cathy at once why have you brought me here again if you don t want to see me my father s very ill and i should be with him tears rolled down linton s face he seemed terrified oh i can t bear it he sobbed cathy i daren t explain but if you leave me he ll kill me dear cathy my life is in your hands kind sweet cathy perhaps you will agree and then he won t hurt me cathy was no longer impatient agree to what linton she asked gently tell me everything you wouldn t do anything to hurt me would you linton i m your best friend i daren t tell you my father the boy gasped just then heathcliff appeared he did not look at cathy and linton who continued talking to each other but he spoke quietly to me ellen how is edgar is he dying as the villagers say it s true the master is dying i answered that boy over there is dying too i only hope edgar dies before him if linton dies first my plan will fail he shouted angrily to his son get up linton and then said politely to cathy miss cathy would you help him back to the house he can t walk far alone father has forbidden me to enter your house said cathy well come along linton i ll have to take you home then said heathcliff no no no please cathy you must come with me screamed linton wildly he held desperately on to her arm cathy could not refuse the boy who seemed almost mad with fear so we all walked the few steps to wuthering heights when we had entered the house however i was horrified to see heathcliff lock the front door the key was in his hand hareton joseph and zillah are all out of the house he said calmly so we are quite alone give me that key cried cathy angrily i m not afraid of you she took hold of his closed hand and bit it he hit her violently several times on both sides of the head and she fell into a chair trembling i rushed at him but he pushed me away cry as much as you like miss cathy he said in a few days i ll be your father and i ll punish you just like that as often as necessary when heathcliff went out to look for our horses cathy and i hurried round the kitchen looking for a way to escape but all the doors and windows were locked linton was sitting calmly in a chair near the fire happy that he was not being punished this time we persuaded him to explain his father s plan to us father is afraid i ll die soon you see so he wants us to be married tomorrow morning you ll have to stay here all night cathy then perhaps he ll let you go home in the morning you marry this beautiful healthy young lady i cried you must be mad and wicked too you and your father have tricked us into coming here and i shook him until he started coughing i must go home now father will be worried already said cathy i love father better than you linton heathcliff returned and sent his son upstairs to bed mr heathcliff begged cathy father will be miserable if i don t go home please let me go i promise to marry linton father would like it and i love him why do you force me to do something i want to do he can t force you i cried i ll go to the police to the devil with you ellen miss cathy i m delighted that your father will be miserable in that case you will certainly stay here for twenty four hours you won t leave here until you ve kept your promise to marry linton please send ellen to let father know i m safe sobbed cathy bitterly poor father he ll think we re lost your father must have hated you when you came into the world i did at least and he ll hate you as he leaves it go on crying that s what you ll be doing when you re linton s wife he ll make a cruel selfish husband i think heathcliff took us upstairs to zillah s room where we spent the night locked in neither of us could sleep at seven the following morning he came to fetch cathy and took her away from that moment i saw nobody except hareton who brought me food for four whole days and nights on the fifth morning zillah came into the room she was surprised and pleased to see me and told me the villagers all thought cathy and i had got lost on the moors and died four days ago i ran out of the room to look for cathy the big kitchen was full of sunshine and the door was open but the only person there was linton where is she where is miss cathy i cried wildly upstairs in a locked room he replied calmly eating a piece of sugar we won t let her go yet father says i shouldn t he soft with cathy we ve had the wedding ceremony so she s my wife now and must stay with me i don t care if she cries or is ill have you forgotten her kindness to you last winter when you wrote that you loved her and she used to come through wind and snow to see you now you believe your father s lies about her and you leave her alone ill and crying in a strange house you pity yourself but you won t pity her what a heartless selfish boy you are i can t stay with her she cries so much i can t bear it i can t sleep with all that noise she promised that if i gave her the key to our room she d give me all her nice books and her pony but i told her she had nothing to give they re all mine or they ll belong to me very soon and then she cried and took a little gold case from around her neck inside were two pictures one of her mother and one of her father i wanted to take them both from her but she wouldn t let me so i screamed for help my father came and ordered her to give him the pictures and the case when she refused he he hit her on the face and knocked her down and broke the gold case under his foot he took away the picture of her mother and were you pleased to see miss cathy hurt i asked my father was right to punish her but i didn t like seeing her mouth full of blood she can t speak because of the pain now you ve made me tired with all this talking you won t find the key to the room go away as there seemed to be no chance of persuading him to help her escape i decided to go back to the grange as quickly as possible and rescue her later what a welcome i received from the servants at the grange who thought i was dead but i did not have time to tell them my story i went straight to my master s room he was lying in bed very weak and close to death i told him how heathcliff had trapped us and that cathy was probably mar ried to linton by now mr edgar realized that his enemy wanted to get hold of the linton fortune through his son he asked me to send for his lawyer to make arrangements so that cathy would not lose all her inheritance i did as he asked but the lawyer sent a message saying that he could not come until the next day i also sent four strong men with weapons to wuthering heights to demand my young lady s freedom i was very angry when they returned without her because heathcliff had sent them away but i needn t have worried in the middle of the night as i was taking some water to the master i heard a knock on the front door and went to open it it was my little mistress ellen ellen she sobbed is father still alive yes i cried and thank god you re safe with us again i managed to make linton help me escape from the room now i must see father i could not bear to be present at their meeting i waited outside the bedroom door but they were both calm cathy s despair was as silent as her father s happiness he died in perfect peace mr lockwood kissing her he whispered i m going to join her and you dear child will join us he did not move or speak again cathy did not cry but sat silently by his dead body all morning at lunch time the lawyer arrived too late to help cathy heathcliff had bribed him to stay away he gave us heathcliff s orders all the servants except me had to leave cathy mrs heathcliff now was only allowed to stay at the grange until her father was buried cathy becomes a widow on the evening after the burial heathcliff came to fetch cathy why not let her stay here with me i begged i m looking for someone to rent the grange from me he answered you ll stay on here as housekeeper ellen but cathy must come to wuthering heights from now on she ll have to work for her food i shall work replied cathy and i ll look after linton he s all i ve got to love in the world i m just sorry for you mr heathcliff you have nobody to love you you are as lonely and miserable as the devil nobody will cry for you when you die i m glad i m not you go and get your clothes you wicked girl he said we ll be leaving in a few minutes when she had gone he walked across the room to look at the picture of cathy s mother catherine which was hanging on the wall do you know what i did yesterday ellen he said turning quickly away from the picture i went to the churchyard and asked the man who was digging edgar s grave to open the lid of catherine s coffin for me her face looked just the same i could not stop looking at her when the man closed the lid i broke open one side of her coffin the side away from edgar s grave and covered it up with earth and i bribed the man to bury me there when i die next to her and to take the side of my coffin away too so that i shall have her in my arms not edgar you were very wicked mr heathcliff to disturb the dead i disturbed nobody ellen and i feel much happier now she is the one who has disturbed me for eighteen years she has haunted me you know i was wild almost mad after she died for days i prayed for her ghost to return to me on the day of her burial i went to her grave in the evening there was a bitter wind and snow on the ground i wanted so much to have her in my arms again so i dug down through the loose earth to her coffin and was about to pull the lid off when i felt a warm breath on my face she seemed to be with me not in the earth but close to me i was so happy that she was with me again i filled in the grave and ran eagerly home to the heights i looked impatiently round for her i could feel her but i could not see her and since then she has played plenty of tricks on me like that when i sleep in her bedroom i can hear her outside the window or entering the room or even breathing close to me but when i open my eyes i m always disappointed slowly slowly she s killing me with the ghost of a hope that s lasted eighteen years he was talking almost to himself so i did not answer when cathy came in he stood up ready to go goodbye ellen whispered my dear little mistress come and visit me as she kissed me her face felt as cold as ice oh no you won t ellen said heathcliff i ll send for you if i want you and together they left the grange i haven t seen cathy since then once i went to the heights to visit her but i was not allowed to see her about six weeks ago i had a long conversation with zillah the housekeeper who gave me news of cathy it appeared that when she ar rived at the heights she did her best to look after her sick husband he was obviously dying although heathcliff refused to call the doctor only a few weeks after her arrival linton died in the night with only cathy by his bedside heathcliff inherited all of linton s and what had been cathy s fortune so cathy is now very poor she must be very miserable and very lonely in that dark unpleasant house heathcliff hates her and joseph and zillah don t speak to her because they think she s too proud poor hareton would like to be friendly with her but she scorns him because he s uneducated i would like to leave my job here rent a little cottage and ask cathy to come and live with me but mr heathcliff will never permit that of course if she married again she could leave that house but i can t arrange that mr lockwood visits wuthering heights again after hearing the end of mrs dean s story i made my plans for the future i decided i did not want to spend another winter at the grange and told her i would ride to the heights to inform my landlord she handed me a letter to give to cathy heathcliff when i arrived at the gate hareton met me and took me into the house cathy was there preparing vegetables for lunch she did not bother to greet me she may be beautiful i thought but she s not very polite i passed by her chair and cleverly dropped mrs dean s note in front of her so that hareton wouldn t see it she however just said aloud what s that a letter from the housekeeper at the grange i said annoyed with her she gasped and tried to pick it up but hareton got there first mr heathcliff will want to look at this he said putting it in his pocket but when cathy pretended to cry hareton could not bear to make her sad and he threw the letter down on the table she eagerly read every word and asked me several questions about the people at the grange mrs dean will want an answer to her letter i reminded her you must tell her that i have no paper or pens to write with i haven t even any books she answered sadly no books i cried how can you manage without them in this lonely place i always used to read so much that mr heathcliff decided to take away my only pleasure and destroy my books i ve looked all over the house for them joseph only reads the bible but some of my books are in hareton s room why did you take them hareton just because you enjoy stealing they can t be any use to you i think mr hareton wants to learn i said hoping to prevent a quarrel between them no doubt he took them away to study them yes replied cathy laughing i hear him trying to read to himself sometimes and it s extremely funny he makes some terrible mistakes after a moment s shocked silence hareton left the room he returned almost immediately with his arms full of books and threw them angrily down at cathy s feet take them he shouted i never want to see them again i won t have them now she said i ll hate them because they ll make me think of you hareton picked up the books and threw them on the fire then walked quickly out of the house mr heathcliff came in as hareton went out he had a restless anxious expression on his face mr heathcliff i said i must tell you i m leaving for london next week for six months and i shan t want to rent the grange any more after october so mr lockwood you ve got tired of the moors already have you well have your lunch with hareton and me anyway cathy take your lunch in the kitchen with joseph and zillah i did not enjoy lunch with my two silent companions and left the heights straight afterwards what a pity i thought that cathy heathcliff and i didn t fall in love as mrs dean would have liked then i could have taken her away from this miserable place for ever several months later in september i was travelling to visit friends in yorkshire i found myself near thrushcross grange and decided to spend a night there after all i was still paying rent for it when i arrived i was surprised to find a different housekeeper who told me mrs dean had become housekeeper at the heights i wanted to have a walk after travelling all day so i left orders for the woman to cook my supper and prepare bedroom for me and i walked the four miles to wuthering heights as i came close to the old house i noticed that there were flowers in the garden and the doors and windows stood open i could see two people inside and i stopped for a moment curious to hear a little of their conversation read it again stupid said a voice as sweet as a silver bell read it correctly this time or i ll pull your hair you must kiss me if i get it right answered a deep voice the man was sitting at a table reading from a book his handsome face shone with pleasure and his eyes often left the book to look at the small white hand that lay on his shoulder the girl stood behind him bending over to help him her face it was fortunate he could not see her face or he would never have been able to concentrate on his studies i could see it and i was bitterly sorry that i had thrown away my chance of seeing that beauty every day of my life i did not want to disturb their happiness so i went round to the back door where i discovered my old friend ellen dean oh mr lockwood welcome back she cried are you staying at the grange again yes mrs dean just for one night but tell me why are you housekeeper here now and not at the grange zillah left you see and mr heathcliff wanted me here i have a little business with him about the rent oh mr heathcliff is dead sir he died three months ago i manage all mrs heathcliff s business for her she hasn t learnt to do it herself yet you see heathcliff is dead i repeated surprised well tell me how it happened mrs dean sit down sir and drink some beer i ll gladly tell you his life ended very strangely heathcliff s end i was delighted to come back to the heights and hoped i could make cathy s life more comfortable but she was restless and complained of loneliness at first she continued to annoy hareton by laughing at him but after a while she decided she really wanted him as a friend she apologized for being rude to him and offered to teach him ev erything she knew from that moment on the two cousins have always been together studying hareton has a lot to learn and cathy is not the most patient of teachers but what they have in common is their love for each other you see mr lockwood it was easy enough to win cathy s heart but now i m glad you didn t try i ll be the happiest woman in england when those two marry heathcliff noticed little of what was happening around him and would never have been aware of the cousins feelings if it hadn t been for joseph in the middle of our lunch one day the old man rushed into the room shaking with anger i ll have to leave i wanted to die here where i ve been a servant for sixty years but now she s taken my garden from me she s stolen the boy s soul master i can t bear it is the fool drunk asked heathcliff can you explain this hareton i ve pulled up two or three of his fruit trees confessed hareton but i ll put them back again it was my fault added cathy bravely i asked him to do it we wanted to plant some flowers there who the devil gave you permission growled heathcliff you should let me have a bit of garden as you ve taken all my land replied cathy sharply and you ve taken hareton s land too he and i are friends now i ll tell him about you the master stood up staring at her fiercely out of the room wicked girl he shouted i ll kill you if i get near you if you hit me hareton will hit you he won t obey you any more and soon he ll hate you as much as i do you d better leave cathy whispered hareton urgently i won t quarrel with mr heathcliff but it was too late i was sure heathcliff was going to hit her he took hold of her one strong hand in her hair and the other raised over her head but when he looked into her face his anger suddenly disappeared and he let his arm fall to his side he sat heavily down in his chair and put his hand over his eyes for a moment we all stared at him you must learn not to make me angry he said trying to be calm go away all of you leave me alone a little later he went out saying he would return in the evening as darkness fell cathy and hareton were busy at their studies in the kitchen i was sitting with them happy to see them helping each other so well i feel they re almost my children mr lockwood and i m very proud of them as the master entered the house he had a full view of us three they lifted their eyes to meet his perhaps you haven t noticed it but their eyes are very similar and they are exactly like those of catherine earnshaw mr heathcliff stopped and stared then looked away at a sign from me cathy and hareton went quietly out into the garden leaving me alone with mr heathcliff it s silly isn t it ellen he muttered that i have worked all my life to destroy these two families the earn shaws and the lintons i ve got their money and their land now i can take my final revenge on the last earnshaw and the last linton i no longer want to there s a strange change coming in my life i m in its shadow i m so little interested in daily events that i even forget to eat and drink i don t want to see those two that s why i don t care if they spend time together she only makes me angry and he looks so like catherine but everything reminds me of catherine in every cloud in every tree i see her face the whole world reminds me that she was here once and i have lost her you don t feel ill sir do you are you afraid of death i m not ill ellen and i m not afraid to die but i can t continue like this i have to remind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat i have a single wish for some thing my whole body and heart and brain have wanted for so long oh god it s a long fight i wish it were finished for some days after that mr heathcliff avoided meeting us at meals he ate less and less late one night i heard him leave the house he did not return until the morning when he came in i noticed a change in his expression there was a strange wild happiness in his face although he was pale and trembling will you have some breakfast sir i asked no i m not hungry he answered i don t think you should stay outside at night sir you ll catch a bad cold or a fever leave me alone ellen he replied i began to worry about him he was strong and healthy but a man must eat in order to live for the next three days he ate nothing at every meal the food lay untouched on the plate in front of him he did not look at the food or at us he seemed to be looking at something quite close to him some thing we could not see his fierce black eyes followed it with such eager interest that he sometimes stopped breathing for as much as half a minute he did not sleep either for three days he had spent the night in catherine earnshaw s old bedroom and i could hear him walking up and down and talking calling crying all night one morning i managed to speak to him and make him listen to me mr heathcliff you must have some food and sleep look at yourself in the mirror you look ill and tired it s not my fault that i can t eat or rest you wouldn t tell a drowning man to rest when he can see the shore i m close to what i ve wanted for eighteen years very close but my soul s happiness is killing my body it s a strange kind of happiness master take my advice and pray to god to forgive you for what you ve done wrong in the past if you think you re going to die thank you ellen you ve reminded me of something it s the way i want to be buried my coffin will be carried to the churchyard in the evening you and hareton will be present nobody else and make sure my orders about the two coffins are obeyed i want no ceremony or words from the bible i don t believe in any of that he spent the next night and the next day in catherine s room muttering and sobbing all the time i sent for dr kenneth but the door was locked so the doctor could not see him the following night was very wet and in the morning as i walked in the garden i noticed that the bedroom window was wide open he must be very wet if he s in bed i thought the bed is so close to the window i ll go and look i found another key which fitted the lock and opened the door mr heathcliff was there in bed lying on his back his eyes were staring at me so eagerly and fiercely and he seemed to be smiling his face and clothes were wet from the rain and he did not move i realized he was dead i closed the window i combed his long black hair from his forehead i tried to close his eyes but they would not shut suddenly frightened i called for joseph the old servant came at once but refused to touch the body ah the devil s taken his soul i warned him that would happen he cried you see how wicked he is smiling at death but thank god hareton earnshaw will have the house and land now that he should have inherited from his father and he went down on his knees to pray hareton was in fact the only one who was sad at heathcliff s death he and i were present at the burial heathcliff was buried next to catherine s grave as he had wished as we were not sure of his age or anything else about him there is only one word on his gravestone heathcliff the villagers are very frightened of his ghost they say he often haunts the churchyard and the moors hareton and cathy will be married on new year s day and they ll move to the grange i ll be their housekeeper joseph will take care of wuthering heights but most of the rooms here won t be used again you ll pass the churchyard mr lockwood on your way back to the grange and you ll see the three gravestones close to the moor catherine s the middle one is old now and half buried in plants which have grown over it on one side is edgar linton s and on the other is heathcliff s new one if you stay there a moment and watch the insects flying in the warm summer air and listen to the soft wind breathing through the grass you ll understand how quietly they rest the sleepers in that quiet earth txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com o liver s early life o liver twist was born in a workhouse and when he arrived in this hard world it was very doubtful whether he would live beyond the first three minutes he lay on a hard little bed and struggled to start breathing o liver fought his first battle without much assistance from the two people present at his birth one was an old woman who was nearly always drunk and the other was a busy local doctor who was not paid enough to be very interested in o liver s survival after all death was a common event in the workhouse where only the poor and homeless lived however o liver managed to draw his first breath and the n announced his arrival to the rest of the workhouse by crying loudly his mother raised her pale young face from the pillow and whispered let me see the child and die the doctor turned away from the fire where he had been warming his hands you must not talk about dying yet he said to her kindly he gave her the child to hold lovingly she kissed the baby on its forehead with her cold white lips the n stared wildly around the room fell back and died poor dear said the nurse hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt the doctor began to put on his coat the baby is weak and will probably have difficulties he said if so give it a little milk to keep it quiet the n he looked at the dead woman the mother was a good looking girl where did she come from she was brought here last night replied the old woman she was found lying in the street she d walked some distance judging by her shoes which were worn to pieces where she came from where she was going to or what her name was nobody knows the doctor lifted the girl s left hand the old story he said sadly shaking his head no wedding ring i see ah good night and so o liver was left with only the drunken nurse without clothe s under his first blanket he could have been the child of a king or a beggar but when the woman dressed him later in rough cotton clothe s yellow with age he looked exactly what he was an orphan in a workhouse ready for a life of misery hunger and neglect o liver cried loudly if he could have known that he was a workhouse orphan perhaps he would have cried even more loudly the re was no one to look after the baby in the workhouse so o liver was sent to a special baby farm nearby the re he and thirty other children rolled around the floor all day without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing mrs mann the old woman who looked after them was very experienced she knew what was good for children and a full stomach was very dangerous to their health she also knew what was good for herself so she kept for her own use the money that she was given for the children s food the board responsible for the orphans sometimes checked on the health of the children but they always sent the beadle a kind of local policeman to announce their visit the day before so whenever the board arrived of course the children were always neat and clean this was the way o liver was brought up consequently at the age of nine he was a pale thin child and short for his age but despite frequent beatings by mrs mann his spirit was strong which was probably the reason why he managed to reach the age of nine at all on o liver s ninth birthday mr bumble the beadle came to the house to see mrs mann through the front window mrs mann saw him at the gate and turned quickly to the girl who worked with her quick take o liver and those others upstairs to be washed she said the n she ran out to unlock the gate it was always kept locked to prevent official visitors walking in unexpectedly i have business to talk about mr bumble told mrs mann as he entered the house he was a big fat man often bad tempered and was full of self importance he did not like to be kept waiting at a locked gate mrs mann took his hat and coat placed a chair for him and expressed great concern for his comfort you ve had a long walk mr bumble she said and you must be thirsty she took out a bottle from the cupboard no thank you mrs mann not a drop he waved the bottle away just a little drop mr bumble with cold water said mrs mann persuasively mr bumble coughed what is it he asked looking at the bottle with interest gin i keep it for the children s medicine drink you give the children gin mrs mann asked mr bumble watching as she mixed his drink only with medicine sir i don t like to see the m suffer you re a good woman mrs mann mr bumble drank half his glass immediately i ll tell the board about you now the reason why i m here o liver twist is nine years old today we ve never been able to discover anything about his parents the n how did he get his name i gave it to him said mr bumble proudly we follow the alphabet the last one was an s swubble the n it was t so this one is twist the next one will be unwin anyway oliver twist is now old enough to return to the workhouse bring him here please while mrs mann went to get him mr bumble finished the rest of his gin oliver his face and hands now almost clean was led into the room will you come along with me oliver asked mr bumble in a loud voice oliver was very glad to be free of mrs mann s violence but he said nothing because she was angrily shaking her finger at him however as the gate closed behind o liver he burst into tears he was leaving behind the other children the only friends he had and he realized at that moment how lonely he was in the world mr bumble walked on with long steps with o liver on his short little legs running beside him the feeling of contentment produced by gin and water had now disappeared and the beadle was in a bad mood once more back at the workhouse o liver was taken to see the board he stood in front of ten fat men who were sitting around a table what s your name boy asked a particularly fat man with a very round red face o liver was frightened at the sight of so many people and started to cry why are you crying the beadle hit him on the back and so naturally o liver cried even more the boy is a fool one member of the board announced you know you have no father or mother said the first man and that you have been brought up with other orphans yes sir replied o liver crying bitterly why is the boy crying repeated the other man puzzled you have come here to be educated continued the fat man so you will start working here tomorrow at six o clock o liver was led away to a large room where on a rough hard bed he cried himself to sleep the room in the workhouse where the boys were fed was a large stone hall and at one end the master and two women served the food this consisted of a bowl of thin soup three times a day with a piece of bread on sundays the boys ate everything and were always hungry the bowls never needed washing the boys polished the m with their spoons until they shone after three months of this slow starvation one of the boys told the others he was so hungry that one night he might eat the boy who slept next to him he had a wild hungry eye and the other boys believed him after a long discussion they decided that one of the m should ask for more food after supper that evening and o liver was chosen the evening arrived the soup was served and the bowls were empty again in a few seconds o liver went up to the master with his bowl in his hand he felt very frightened but also desperate with hunger please sir i want some more the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale he looked at the little boy in front of him with amazement nobody else spoke what he asked at last in a faint voice please sir replied o liver i want some more the master hit him with the serving spoon the n seized o liver s arms and shouted for the beadle the beadle came quickly heard the dreadful news and immediately ran to tell the board he asked for more mr limbkins the fattest board member asked in horror bumble is this really true that boy will be hanged said the man who earlier had called o liver a fool you see if i m not right o liver was led away to be locked up and a reward was offered to anybody who would take him away and use him for work o liver s first job o liver stayed a prisoner alone in the dark room for a week he cried bitterly all day and when the long night came he spread his little hands over his eyes to shut out the darkness and tried to sleep he was given freezing water to wash with and was beaten daily by mr bumble in front of all the other boys in the hall as a warning to the m one day mr bumble met the local undertaker mr sowerberry outside the workhouse do you know anybody who wants to train a boy for work mr sowerberry mr bumble pointed at the notice on the wall above him which offered five pounds to anybody who would take o liver twist for work mr sowerberry rubbed his chin and thought for a while i pay enough for the poor with my taxes he said so why shouldn t i be able to make use of the m in my work yes i ll take the boy myself and so the board agreed to send o liver to work for the undertaker the necessary papers were signed o liver s small possessions were put into a brown paper parcel and he was led to mr sowerberry s house by mr bumble as they walked along tears began to run down o liver s face what is it this time asked mr bumble impatiently don t be so ungrateful this gentleman is going to look after you it s just that i m so lonely sir said the child everybody hates me please don t be angry with me sir even mr bumble felt a little pity he coughed told o liver to dry his eyes and be a good boy and walked on with him in silence the undertaker had just finished work for the day when mr bumble entered his shop here i ve brought the boy said the beadle o liver bowed to the undertaker who raised his candle to get a better view of the boy mrs sowerberry he called come and have a look his wife a short thin woman with a disagreeable face came out to see he s very small she said immediately he is agreed mr bumble but he ll grow mrs sowerberry yes she said crossly when he eats our food go on get downstairs she pushed o liver downstairs into a damp dark kitchen and called to the girl working down the re here charlotte give this boy some meat that the dog left if he thinks it s good enough for him o liver tore the meat to pieces with his teeth as if he were a wild animal mrs sowerberry watched him in silent horror already thinking about her future food bills then took him upstairs to the shop you ll sleep here among the coffins she said o liver stared around the dark airless shop at the coffins some finished some only half made he trembled at the thought of ghosts his bed was a small hole in the floor and looked very like a grave but it was not only the room that depressed o liver he felt very lonely with no friends and no one to care for him as he lay on the bed he found himself wishing that it really was his grave the next morning he was woken up by someone kicking at the shop door open the door will you shouted a voice through the keyhole yes sir i suppose you re the new boy said the voice through the keyhole how old are you ten sir the n i ll hit you when i get in said the voice o liver was experienced enough to know that the promise was probably true he opened the door with a shaking hand the n looked up and down the street all he could see was a large boy wearing the uniform of one of the charity schools where the children of the very poor used to go did you want a coffin asked o liver innocently the charity boy looked at him fiercely you ll be needing a coffin soon workhouse if you make jokes like that i m mister noah claypole and you re working under me now hurry up and open the curtains as he said this he kicked o liver and entered the shop he was a big clumsy boy of about fourteen with a large head and very small eyes added to the se attractions were a red nose and dirty yellow trousers the boys went down to breakfast which the girl charlotte had made for the m she gave an extra piece of meat to noah the n told o liver to hurry up as it was his job to look after the shop did you hear that workhouse shouted noah he heard noah said charlotte leave him alone why asked noah all his relations have already left him alone his mother and father aren t going to interfere with him charlotte and noah both started laughing loudly o liver sat alone in the corner eating old bits of bread noah was a charity boy but not a workhouse orphan he at least knew who his parents were but for a long time all the local shop boys had insulted him because he wore the uniform of a charity boy now fortune had brought him a creature in an even lower position in society than himself noah intended to repay to o liver every insult he had ever received and to make the new boy s life a misery after a few weeks mr sowerberry decided that he liked o liver s appearance enough to train him in the undertaking business o liver s permanent expression of sadness was very suitable the undertaker thought for collecting dead bodies from houses and accompanying the coffins to funerals one day mr bumble came to tell the m about a woman who had died in an extremely poor part of the town and sowerberry and o liver went to collect the body they went down dirty narrow streets where the houses on either side were tall and large but very old some of the houses were almost falling down and had to be supported by huge blocks of wood the area was so poor that even the dead rats in the street looked as though they had died of hunger they found the right house and climbed the dark stairs to a miserable little room some children watched the m from the shadows as they entered something lay beneath a blanket on the floor in one corner a man and an old woman stood near the body o liver was afraid to look at the m with their thin faces and sharp teeth they looked like the rats he had seen outside as sowerberry began to measure the body for a coffin the man knelt on the floor and cried out she starved to death i tell you that s why she died he fell to the floor and all the children behind him started to cry sowerberry and o liver their work done left as fast as they could they returned the next day with the coffin and four men from the workhouse who were to carry it the man and the old woman followed the coffin to the church and waited silently by the grave for the priest to arrive when at last he came he hurried through the burial prayers and as quickly as possible it was only a job after all the coffin was put into the ground at this point the husband who had not moved once during his wife s burialnot even during the long wait for the priest suddenly fainted to the ground and had to have cold water thrown over him so how did you like it o liver asked sowerberry later as they walked home not very much sir o liver answered truthfully you ll get used to it my boy o liver wondered how long that would take and remained silent all the way back to the shop thinking about everything that he had seen and heard o liver goes to london o liver was now officially an undertaker s assistant it was a good sickly time of year and coffins were selling well o liver gained a lot of experience in a short time and was interested to see how brave some people were after a death in the family during funerals for some rich people for example he saw that the people who had cried the loudest in church usually recovered the fastest afterwards he noticed how in other wealthy families the wife or the husband often seemed quite cheerful and calm despite the recent death just as if nothing had happened o liver was very surprised to see all this and greatly admired the m for controlling their sadness so well he was treated badly by most of the people around him noah was jealous because o liver went out to burials while he was left back in the shop so he treated him even worse than before charlotte treated him badly because noah did and mrs sowerberry was his enemy because mr sowerberry was supposed to be his friend one day something happened which might seem unimportant but which had a great effect on o liver s future noah was in a particularly bad mood one dinner time and so he tried to make o liver cry by hitting him pulling his hair and calling him horrible names this was all unsuccessful so he tried personal insults workhouse how s your mother he asked she s dead replied o liver his face going red with emotion noah hoped that o liver was going to cry so he continued what did she die of workhouse of a broken heart i was told and a tear rolled down o liver s cheek why are you crying workhouse o liver remained silent and noah grew braver you know i feel very sorry for you workhouse but the truth is your mother was a wicked woman o liver seemed suddenly to wake up what did you say she was so bad it was lucky she died or she would have ended up in prison or hung his face bright red with anger o liver jumped up seized noah s throat and shook the older boy so violently that his teeth nearly fell out the n he hit him with all his strength and knocked him to the ground he ll murder me screamed noah charlotte help o liver s gone mad charlotte and mrs sowerberry ran in and screamed in horror they took hold of o liver and began to heat him the n noah got up and started to kick him from behind when they were all tired they forced o liver who was still fighting and shouting into the cellar and locked it mrs sowerberry sat down breathing heavily he s like a wild animal she said we could all have been murdered in our beds i hope mr sowerberry doesn t take any more of the se dreadful creatures from the workhouse said charlotte poor noah was nearly killed mrs sowerberry looked at noah sympathetically noah who was twice o liver s size pretended to rub tears from his eyes what shall we do cried mrs sowerberry he ll kick that door down in ten minutes they could hear o liver banging and kicking at the cellar door noah run and get mr bumble so noah ran through the streets as quickly as he could to fetch the beadle when he reached the workhouse he waited for a minute to make sure his face was suitably tearful and frightened as soon as mr bumble came out noah cried mr bumble mr bumble it s o liver twist sir he s become violent he tried to murder me sir and charlotte and mrs sowerberry as well mr bumble was shocked and angry did he i ll come up the re immediately and beat him with my stick when he arrived at the shop o liver was still kicking wildly at the cellar door let me out he shouted from the cellar when he heard mr bumble s voice i m not afraid of you mr bumble stopped for a moment amazed and even rather frightened by this change in o liver the n he said to mrs sowerberry it s the meat that s caused this you know what meat madam you ve fed him too well here back in the workhouse this would never have happened i knew i was too generous to him said mrs sowerberry raising her eyes to the ceiling at that moment mr sowerberry returned and hearing what had happened according to the ladies he beat o liver so hard that even mr bumble and mrs sowerberry were satisfied mr sowerberry was not a cruel man but he had no choice he knew that if he didn t punish o liver his wife would never forgive him that night alone in the room with the coffins o liver cried bitter lonely tears he did not sleep and very early in the morning before anyone was awake he quietly unlocked the shop door and left the house he ran up the street and through the town as far as the main road where he saw a sign that told him it was just seventy miles from the re to london the name london gave the boy an idea that huge place nobody not even mr bumble could ever find him the re he had heard old men in the workhouse say it was a good place for brave boys and that the re was always work the re for those that wanted it it would be the best place for him he jumped to his feet and walked forward again but after only four miles he began to realize just how far he would have to walk he stopped to think about it he had a piece of bread a rough shirt two pairs of socks and a penny but he could not see how the se would help him get to london any faster so he continued walking he walked twenty miles that day the only thing he had to eat was his piece of bread and some water which he begged from houses near the road he slept the first night in a field feeling lonely tired cold and hungry he was even hungrier the next morning when he woke up and he had to buy some more bread with his penny that day he walked only twelve miles his legs were so weak that they shook beneath him the next day he tried to beg for money but large signs in some villages warned him that anyone caught begging would be sent to prison travellers on the road refused to give him money they said he was a lazy young dog and didn t deserve anything farmers threatened to send their dogs after him when he waited outside pubs the pub owners chased him away because they thought he had come to steal something only two people were kind enough to feed him an old woman and a gate keeper on the road if they had not given him some food he surely would have died like his mother early on the seventh morning of his journey o liver finally reached the little town of barnet just outside london exhausted he sat down at the side of the road his feet were bleeding and he was covered in dust he was too tired even to beg the n he noticed that a boy who had passed him a few minutes before had returned and was now looking at him carefully from the opposite side of the road after a long time the boy crossed the road and said to o liver hello what s the matter the n the boy was about o liver s age but was one of the strangest looking people he had ever seen he had a dirty ordinary boy s face but he behaved as if he were an adult he was short for his age and had little sharp ugly eyes his hat was stuck on top of his head but it looked as though it would blow off at any minute he wore a man s coat which reached almost down to his feet with sleeves so long that his hands were completely covered i m very tired and hungry answered o liver almost crying i ve been walking for a week a week the magistrate s order was it the magistrate what s that a magistrate s a kind of judge explained the surprised young gentleman he realized o liver did not have much experience of the world never mind that you want some food he went on i haven t got much money but don t worry i ll pay the boy helped o liver to his feet and took him to a pub meat bread and beer were placed before o liver and his new friend urged him to satisfy his hunger while o liver was eating the strange boy looked at him from time to time with great attention going to london he asked him finally yes got anywhere to live no money no the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coat sleeves would allow him i suppose you want to sleep somewhere tonight don t you i do replied o liver i haven t slept under a roof since i started my journey well don t worry i ve got to be in london tonight and i know a very nice old gentleman the re who ll let you live in his place and not even ask you for money o liver was deeply grateful for this offer of shelter and talked for a long time with his new friend his name was jack dawkins but he was usually called the artful dodger artful because he was very clever at getting what he wanted and dodger because he was very good at not getting caught when he did something wrong when he heard this o liver felt rather doubtful about having such a friend however he wanted first to meet the kind old gentleman in london who would help him after that he could decide whether to continue the friendship with the artful dodger o liver in london for some reason the dodger did not want to enter london during daylight so it was nearly eleven o clock at night when they got near the centre o liver had never seen a dirtier or more miserable place the streets in this district were narrow and muddy and the re were terrible smells everywhere children wandered around even at this time of night in and out of the many shops playing and screaming the pubs were full of people fighting and big evil looking men stood in doorways or at dark corners o liver almost wanted to run away but just the n the dodger pushed open a door and pulled o liver into a dark hall who s the re a voice cried out it s me said the dodger the faint light of a candle appeared in the hall who s the other one a new friend they went up some dark and broken stairs o liver could hardly see where he was going but the dodger seemed to know the way and helped o liver up they entered a room with walls that were black with age and dirt in front of the fire was a table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer and an old man with a horribly ugly face and red hair stood next to the fire cooking he was wearing a dirty old coat and seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchieves which were hanging near the fire the re were several rough beds in the room four or five boys about the same age as the artful dodger sat round the table smoking and drinking like middle aged men they all looked up when the dodger and o liver entered this is him fagin the dodger said to the old man my friend o liver twist fagin smiled and shook o liver s hand the n all the young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard especially the hand which held his few possessions one of the boys was particularly kind he even put his hands in o liver s pockets so that o liver would not have to empty the m himself when he went to bed the boys would probably have been even more helpful but fagin hit the m on their heads and shoulders until they left o liver alone we re very glad to see you o liver said fagin i see you re staring at the handkerchieves my dear aren t the re a lot we ve just taken the m all out to wash the m that s all ha ha ha this seemed to be a joke as the old gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter the n supper began o liver ate his share of the food and was the n given a glass of gin and water fagin told him to drink it fast immediately afterwards o liver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep when he woke it was late morning fagin was the only other person in the room and he was boiling coffee in a pan when the coffee was done he turned towards o liver and looked closely at the boy o liver was only just awake and his eyes were half closed so he seemed to be still fast asleep fagin the n locked the door and from a hidden hole in the floor he took out a small box which he placed carefully on the table his eyes shone as he opened it and took out a gold watch covered in jewels aah he said to himself what fine men they were loyal to the end they never told the priest where the jewels were nor about old fagin not even at the very end and why should they it was already too late it wouldn t have stopped the rope going round their necks fagin took out at least six more watches as well as rings and bracelets and many other valuable pieces of jewellery he looked at the m with pleasure the n replaced the m what a good thing hanging is he murmured dead men can never talk or betray old friends at that moment he looked up and saw o liver watching him he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and picked up a bread knife from the table why are you watching me what have you seen tell me quick i couldn t sleep any longer sir said o liver terrified i m very sorry you weren t awake an hour ago fagin asked fiercely still holding the knife i promise i was n t sir replied o liver don t worry my dear fagin said putting down the knife and becoming once again the kind old gentleman he laughed i only tried to frighten you my dear you re a brave boy o liver and did you see any of the pretty things yes sir ah said fagin turning rather pale they they re mine o liver all i have in my old age o liver wondered why the old man lived in such an old dirty place when he had so many watches but the n he thought that it must cost fagin a lot of money to look after the dodger and the other boys so he said nothing and got up and washed when he turned towards fagin the box had disappeared soon the dodger entered with a cheerful young man named charley bates have you been at work this morning fagin asked the dodger hard at work answered the dodger good boys good boys said fagin what have you got a couple of pocket books and some handkerchieves good workers aren t they o liver said the old man very good said o liver the others all started laughing though o liver saw nothing funny in his answer fagin inspected the handkerchieves and told the two boys that they were extremely well made and that he was very pleased with their work after breakfast they played a very strange game the cheerful old man put a watch in his jacket pocket with a guard chain round his neck and a notebook and a handkerchief in his trouser pocket the n he went up and down the room holding a walking stick just like the old gentlemen who walked in the streets sometimes he stopped at the fireplace and sometimes at the door pretending to stare with great interest into shop windows he would the n constantly look round as if afraid of thieves touching all his pockets in such a natural and funny way that o liver laughed until tears ran down his face all the time the two boys followed fagin everywhere and every time he turned round they moved out of his sight so quickly that it was impossible to follow their movements finally the dodger bumped into him accidentally from behind and at that moment both boys took from him very quickly his watch guard chain handkerchief and notebook if the old man felt a hand in any of his pockets he cried out and the n the game began again later the boys went out again to do some more work when they had gone fagin turned to o liver take my advice my dear he said make the m your models especially the dodger he ll be a great man himself and will make you one too if you copy him is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear yes sir said o liver see if you can take it out without my feeling it just as you saw the m doing it when we were playing o liver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen the dodger hold it and pulled the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other has it gone asked fagin here it is sir said o liver showing it in his hand you re a clever boy my dear said the old gentleman putting his hand on o liver s head i ve never seen a quicker boy if you go on like this you ll be the greatest man in london now come here and i ll show you how to take the marks out of handkerchieves o liver wondered what the connection was between playing at stealing from the old gentleman s pocket and becoming a great man but he followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study o liver remained in fagin s room for many days picking the marks and names out of the handkerchieves and sometimes playing the same game as before one evening two young ladies came to visit and a very cheerful party followed o liver thought they were very nice friendly girls the dodger and charley bates went out to work every day but sometimes came home with no handkerchieves and fagin would get very angry once he even knocked the m both down the stairs and sent the m to bed with no dinner because they had returned with nothing at last the morning came when o liver was allowed to go out to work with the two other boys the re had been no handkerchieves for him to work on for several days and the re was not very much to eat for dinner the three boys set out but they walked so slowly that o liver thought they were not going to work at all the n suddenly the dodger stopped and put his finger to his lips what s the matter demanded o liver be quiet replied the dodger do you see that old man outside the book shop he s the one o liver looked from the dodger to charley bates with great surprise and confusion but he had been told not to ask questions the two boys walked quickly and secretly across the road towards the old gentleman o liver followed behind the m watching in silent amazement the old gentleman looked quite rich he wore gold glasses white trousers and had an expensive walking stick under his arm he had picked up a book and was standing the re reading it with great concentration just as if he were in his own armchair at home o liver his eyes wide with horror and alarm watched as the dodger put his hand in the old gentleman s pocket took out a hand kerchief and hand ed it to charley bates the n the two of the m ran round the corner as fast as they could suddenly the whole mystery of the handkerchieves and the watches and the jewels and fagin became clear o liver stood for a moment in terror blood rushing through him until he felt he was on fire the n confused and frightened he started to run at the same time the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and realizing his hand kerchief was missing turned round he saw o liver running away so he naturally thought o liver was the thief with loud cries of stop thief he ran after o liver with the book still in his hand the old gentleman was not the only one who started shouting the dodger and charley bates not wanting to attract attention to the mselves by running down the street had stopped round the first corner when they realized what was happening they also shouted stop thief and joined in the chase like good citizens the cry of stop thief always causes great excitement everybody in the street stopped what they were doing and began to shout the mselves many joined in the chase with enthusiasm and soon the re was a big crowd running after o liver finally they caught the exhausted boy he fell down on the pavement and the crowd gathered round him is this the boy they asked the old gentleman yes he answered leaning over o liver but i m afraid he s hurt himself i did that said a huge young man proudly and i hurt my hand doing it the old gentleman looked at him with an expression of dislike o liver lay on the ground covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth and looked wildly at all the faces surrounding him at that moment a policeman arrived and took o liver by the collar come on get up he said roughly it wasn t me sir said o liver looking round it was two other boys they re here somewhere oh no they aren t replied the policeman in fact he was right as the dodger and charley had quietly disappeared as soon as the crowd had caught o liver come on get up don t hurt him said the old gentleman i won t said the policeman tearing o liver s jacket half off his back as he lifted him up the three of the m started walking followed by the excited crowd o liver s life changes o liver was taken to the nearest police station the officer at the gate looked at the boy another young thief eh he turned to the old gentleman are you the person who was robbed sir yes i am replied the old gentleman but i m not sure that this boy actually took the hand kerchief i don t really want to take him to court too late he must go before the magistrate now o liver was locked in a small stone cell which was disgustingly dirty and smelly as the key turned in the lock the old gentleman said to himself thoughtfully the re s something in that boy s face he could be innocent where have i seen someone like him before after thinking about this for a few minutes he said no it must be imagination he sighed unhappily and began reading the book again some time later the officer touched his shoulder and told him that the court was ready a magistrate was a judge who dealt with small crimes in local courts and the magistrate for this district was well known his name was mr fang and he was a disagreeable bad tempered man today he was in a particularly bad mood he frowned angrily at the old gentleman and asked sharply who are you my name sir is brown low officer what is this man charged with he s not charged sir answered the officer he s accusing the boy the magistrate looked at mr brown low from head to foot and what have you got to say mr brown low began to explain i was standing outside a book shop be quiet sir shouted mr fang policeman now you arrested the boy what happened the policeman told the magistrate what he had heard and how he had searched o liver afterwards and found nothing are the re any witnesses asked the magistrate none answered the policeman mr fang the n turned to mr brown low and angrily told him to describe what had happened mr brown low explained that he had run after the boy only because he saw him running away he did not think that the boy was the actual thief and he hoped that the boy would not be punished he s been hurt already he added and now i m afraid he s very ill i don t believe that for a moment said mr fang unpleasantly he turned to o liver come now don t try any clever tricks with me what s your name he demanded o liver tried to reply but he was too weak to speak he was deadly pale and he felt the room spinning round him at last he managed to whisper a request for water but the magistrate refused angrily suddenly o liver fainted and fell to the floor mr fang stared at him angrily guilty three months prison he said immediately let him lie the re he ll soon be tired of that mr fang stood up this court is now closed at that moment a man in an old black coat rushed in stop he shouted don t take the boy away i saw it all i m the book shop owner mr fang s face was black with anger at this unexpected interruption but the book shop owner demanded to be heard he described exactly what had really happened he had seen two boys steal the hand kerchief and the n run away leaving o liver to be arrested in a final burst of bad temper mr fang said that his time had been wasted he announced that o liver was innocent and ordered everybody out of the court the order was obeyed and as mr brown low turned to go down the street he saw o liver lying on the pavement shaking his face as white as death poor boy poor boy said mr brown low bending over him he called a coach quickly laid o liver on the seat and drove away the coach stopped at a neat house in a quiet shady street in north london o liver was gently carried in to a bed and received more care and kindness than he had ever had in his life but he had a fever and for many days he lay the re unconscious when he eventually awoke weak thin and pale he looked anxiously around the room what room is this where am i he said this is not the place i fell asleep in mrs bed win the motherly old housekeeper heard his words and instantly came to him hush be quiet my dear or you ll be ill again lie down he lay down and woke up again much later after a while he was able to sit up in a chair although he was still too weak to walk in this new position he could see a picture of a woman hanging on the wall opposite who is that madam he asked the old housekeeper i don t know my dear do you like it the eyes look so sad and they seem to be staring at me as if the person was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldn t you re weak and nervous after your illness mrs bed win said kindly don t worry about things like that later that day mr brown low came in having heard that the boy was a little better at last he was delighted to see that o liver could sit up but when he saw o liver s face clearly mr brown low stared hard at him i hope you re not angry with me sir said o liver anxiously no no not in the least he replied the n he turned to the housekeeper but look mrs bed win look the re he pointed to the picture of the woman above o liver s head and the n to the boy s face it was a living copy of the picture even the expression was the same o liver did not understand what was happening he was so alarmed by mr brown low s excitement that he fainted once more the dodger and charley bates had left the crowd which was chasing o liver as soon as they could they went back to their house through the narrow streets using a complicated route in case anyone was following the m once they were safely away from other people charley bates rolled on the ground and laughed and laughed ha ha ha when i saw o liver running away so fast round all the corners bumping into walls and all the time i had the hand kerchief in my pocket ha ha ha but what ll fagin say asked the dodger what do you mean the dodger said nothing more but led charley bates into the house and up the stairs when fagin saw the m enter he rose to his feet where s o liver he asked the m furiously the two boys looked uneasily at each other but said nothing fagin took hold of the dodger s collar and shook him violently tell me or i ll kill you the dodger slid out of his coat in one smooth movement leaving fagin holding only the empty coat the police have got him he said reluctantly he looked round for a weapon to fight with but fagin already had a heavy metal pot in his hand he threw it hard at the dodger but missed and hit charley bates who started to shout with fear suddenly all this noise and confusion was silenced by a deep voice at the door what the devil s going on here the voice demanded the owner of the voice was a big man of about thirty five in a black coat and very dirty trousers with a brown hat on his head and a dirty hand kerchief around his neck he also had a three day old beard a white dog with torn ears followed him into the room the man kicked the dog into a corner and looked round at the signs of battle are they trying to murder you fagin i would if i was the m i d have done it long ago now give me some beer and don t poison it it was said as a joke but if the man had seen the evil look on fagin s face he might have thought the warning was a necessary one fagin produced some beer and as the fight appeared to be over everybody sat down in the conversation that followed fagin told the newcomer that o liver had been caught by the police i m afraid mr sikes he said the boy may say something which will get us into trouble very likely said bill sikes smiling unkindly you vegot problems fagin and i m afraid added fagin ignoring sikes remark that if we re in trouble the n a lot of other people will be in trouble too if you understand me my dear sikes turned angrily towards the old man the re was a silence the n sikes said somebody must find out what s happened if he hasn t said anything yet we must catch him when he leaves the police station fagin nodded but the re was a difficulty none of the m wanted to go anywhere near a police station the problem was solved with the arrival of the two young ladies whom o liver had met one evening in fagin s house nancy my dear fagin said he smiled sweetly at one of the young ladies can you go to find out what s happened to o liver the young lady answered calmly no i won t you re the only one here that the police in this district don t know said sikes she ll go fagin no repeated nancy yes she will fagin sikes was right with a mixture of threats and promises he soon persuaded nancy to go she set off at once and at the police station pretended to be a shy frightened girl is my poor little brother o liver here she asked the officer with the keys he s not here the officer replied the gentleman s got him the gentleman oh no what gentleman cried nancy very upset the policeman explained that o liver had become ill and the old gentleman had taken him to his house in the pentonville district of north london nancy still looking terribly upset left the station and hurried back to fagin s house with this news as soon as he heard it sikes called his white dog put on his hat and left without saying goodbye to anyone we must find him fagin said urgently to the rest of the m no one can stay here it s too dangerous now all of you walk around pentonville and keep your ears open don t come back until you have some news of o liver if you can kidnap him we ve got to keep him quiet before he starts talking about us to his new friends with the se words he pushed the m all from his room and double locked the door behind the m the n he took out his hidden box and very carefully hid all the watches and the jewellery beneath his clothe s o liver is found again o liver began to recover and slowly regain his strength the picture that had caused mr brown low s excitement was taken down from the wall and was not mentioned again o liver was disappointed at the disappearance of the picture since he liked the woman s face but he had many other things to think about now they were happy days while o liver was getting better he played cards with mrs bed win and listened to stories about her family the days were all so quiet and relaxing after the hardships and poverty of his previous life mr brown low bought him a new suit and new shoes and o liver s dirty old clothe s were given away one day mr brown low asked him to come to his study for a little talk o liver went in and sat down he looked at mr brown low s serious face in alarm don t tell me you re going to send me away sir please he exclaimed let me stay here i could help with the housework please sir my dear child don t be afraid said mr brown low kindly i won t desert you i believe that you re a good boy not a common thief you told me you re an orphan that seems to be the truth but i want to hear now the whole story of your life and how you came to be with the boys i saw you with that day o liver began his story but was soon interrupted by the arrival of mr grimwig an old friend of mr brown low s mr grimwig was a fierce old gentleman and very fond of arguments he clearly knew all about o liver and inspected him closely so this is the boy is it he said at last o liver bowed politely and was introduced by mr brown low tea was the n brought in and during the meal mr grimwig stared so hard at o liver that the boy felt rather confused eventually mr grimwig whispered to mr brown low he may be a good looking boy but i think he s deceiving you my good friend nonsense said mr brown low becoming angry well we ll see answered his friend we ll see later that afternoon mr brown low wanted to return some books to a bookseller and to send some money for new books that he had already collected mr grimwig suggested that o liver should go he ll be sure to deliver everything safely he said with a smile yes please let me take the m said o liver delighted to be of use mr brown low hesitated but mr grimwig s smile had annoyed him very well he said here are the books o liver and a five pound note the bookseller will give you ten shillings change i won t be ten minutes replied o liver eagerly and he ran out into the street so you expect him to come back do you enquired mr grimwig yes i do said mr brown low smiling confidently don t you no he has a new suit of clothe s some valuable books and a five pound note in his pocket he ll join his old friends the thieves and laugh at you if he comes back i ll eat my hat the two men sat by the window with a pocket watch between the m and waited for o liver s return o liver hurried through the streets to the book shop thinking how lucky he was suddenly the re was a loud scream behind him oh my dear brother before be could look round a pair of arms was thrown tightly around his neck don t he cried struggling let go why are you stopping me who is it the young woman holding him started to cry loudly i ve found him oh o liver you naughty boy to make me suffer so much come home immediately you cruel boy she burst into tears and several people stopped to stare at what was happening what s the matter asked one of the watching women he ran away from his parents a month ago the young woman said they re hard working respectable people and he left the m to join a gang of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his mother s heart go home you horrible child said another woman yes go back to your parents said a third but i haven t got any replied o liver greatly alarmed i haven t got a sister either i m an orphan i live in pentonville listen to him make him come home the young woman said to the crowd or he ll kill his dear mother and father and break my heart suddenly o liver recognized the woman he had seen in fagin s house it s nancy he said without thinking you see cried nancy to the crowd he knows me just the n a big man ran out of a beer shop followed by a white dog what s this young o liver come home to your poor mother you young devil and what books are the se you ve stolen the m haven t you give the m to me the man who was bill sikes seized o liver with one strong hand and hit him on the head with the other that ll do him good shouted some of the crowd it s the only way to treat boys like him bill sikes held onto o liver s arm come on you young thief still weak from illness and terrified by the growling dog o liver could not resist he was taken through the dark narrow streets at great speed sikes and nancy gave him no chance to escape and o liver had no breath to call out for help all too quickly he was back in fagin s house where his old friends were waiting for him delighted to see you looking so well my dear fagin said bowing politely why didn t you write and say you were coming we d have got something warm for supper the dodger and charley bates roared with laughter and the dodger began looking through the books o liver had with him give the m back o liver cried those books belong to the kind old gentleman who took me into his home send him back the books and the money he ll think i stole the m you re right laughed fagin he will think that o liver jumped to his feet and ran wildly from the room shouting for help the dodger and fagin caught him easily and brought him back the n the old man picked up a long piece of wood so you wanted to get away my dear did you wanted to call the police and get help we ll cure you of that he hit o liver hard on the shoulders with the stick he was raising it for a second hit when nancy rushed forward and seizing the piece of wood threw it into the fire i won t let you do it fagin she shouted you ve got him again isn t that enough now leave him alone fagin and sikes looked at each other shocked by her reaction you d better keep quiet my girl growled sikes no i won t cried the girl wildly now you ve got the boy you ll turn him into a thief and a liar isn t that enough without killing him too she rushed at fagin and would have hit him if sikes had not held her arms so tightly that she couldn t move she struggled wildly for a while the n exhausted she fainted sikes laid her down in the corner as surprised as fagin at her anger she can be really wild when she s angry sikes said fagin wiped his forehead that s the trouble with women he said but she s a clever girl in her work the n charley bates and the dodger took away o liver s expensive new suit gave him some old clothe s and locked him up in a dark room o liver felt tired and ill and was soon fast asleep the robbery a few days later a visitor arrived in london from o liver s home town he was a large fat man and very proud of his hat which showed the world that he was a most important official it was in fact mr bumble the beadle o liver s old enemy mr bumble had completed his business in the city and had just finished a most satisfactory meal in a pub he pulled up his chair to the fire to enjoy his hot gin and water in comfort and opened the newspaper the first thing he saw was this notice a reward of five pounds is offered for any information leading to the discovery of a young boy o liver twist who was kidnapped from his home in pentonville last thursday evening i am also very interested in any information about his past the re was the n a full description of o liver s clothe s and appearance and mr brown low s full address mr bumble rubbed his eyes read the notice again and was at the address in less than ten minutes he was shown into mr brown low s study where the old gentleman and his friend mr grimwig were sitting do you know where the poor boy is now mr brown low asked when the beadle had explained the reason for his visit mr bumble shook his head do you know anything good about him asked mr grimwig looking closely at mr bumble s face mr bumble shook his head again very seriously and turned down the corners of his mouth the n tell us everything you know about him said mr brown low impatiently mr bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms and sat back in his chair he spoke in his most important and official voice and talked for twenty minutes his listeners heard all the details of o liver s illegitimate birth and how generously he had been treated as a workhouse orphan they heard how he had always been an ungrateful and dangerous child violently attacking another boy and finally running away from the house where he had been working the old gentleman shook his head sadly and gave mr bumble the five pounds i would have been happy to give you three times the amount if your story had proved that the boy was good if mr bumble had known this earlier he might have told a different story but now it was too late so he took the money and left mr brown low walked up and down his room for several minutes deep in thought he rang the bell for mrs bed win his housekeeper and told her what he had heard i don t believe it she said with great certainty i was right said mr grimwig with satisfaction you should have listened to what i said mr brown low said angrily never let me hear the boy s name again never remember that mrs bed win the re were sad hearts at mr brown low s house that night meanwhile in another part of london o liver remained a prisoner fagin had told o liver how ungrateful he had been to run away he had told him that he would have died of hunger without fagin s kindness he went on to tell o liver the story of another young boy who had gone to the police to tell the m about the gang but who had finally been hanged one morning for being a thief fagin described the hanging in terrifying detail and said that he hoped he would never have to tell the police about o liver and see o liver with a rope around his neck o liver felt his blood turn cold he remained locked in a room for many days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight he spent his time thinking sadly about his friends in pentonville after a week he was free to wander round the house during the day it was a dirty place full of rats and insects but no other living thing all the windows were closed and covered with wood and metal bars that kept out the light one afternoon the dodger and charley bates were at home and they started telling o liver about their lives as thieves why don t you become one charley asked him we all are here both of us and fagin sikes nancy all of us i don t want to be replied o liver i wish they d let me go but it s a good life the dodger said taking some coins from his pocket and throwing the m up in the air what does it matter where the money comes from he said laughing if you don t steal it someone else will you can be sure of that fagin entered at this point with two young men and joined in the conversation one of the young men had just come out of prison and the re were many cheerful jokes about his very short hair cut everybody sat around the fire talking and laughing for hours fagin told o liver how good the dodger was at his job and what a friendly boy charley was it was without doubt an interesting evening for o liver after so many days locked up alone after that evening he was rarely on his own again he spent a lot of time with the dodger and charley and often played the hand kerchief game with the m at other times fagin would tell the m all about robberies he had committed in his younger days telling the stories so well and putting in so many funny details that o liver could not stop laughing even though he knew it was wrong fagin knew what he was doing he had made sure that o liver was so lonely and miserable that he would be desperate for any friends however criminal slowly and deliberately fagin was trying to poison the young boy s mind one damp cold windy night a few weeks later fagin put on his heavy coat and with the collar pulled up high to hide his face left his home he walked fast through the streets never losing his way even in the darkest places finally he reached an evil narrow street lit only by a single lamp he knocked on a door said something quietly to the person who opened it the n walked upstairs bill sikes was sitting by his fire with his dog when fagin entered the room was a small dark place with almost no furniture nancy was the re too and fagin glanced at her uneasily he had not seen her since she had attacked him to stop him hitting o liver however she seemed to have forgotten all about it because she told him to pull up a chair and warm himself by the fire i m ready for business bill sikes said looking at fagin suspiciously say what you have to say fagin it s about the robbery at chertsey bill answered fagin some lovely silver in that house down the re i know i know sikes said i was down the re two nights ago to have a look at the house but it s locked like a prison at night all except one part where s that asked fagin bending his head forwards his eyes staring excitedly at sikes do you think i m stupid i m not telling you anyway what we need is a boy so the re s a small place where only a boy can enter the house asked fagin maybe but we need a boy the re was silence for a time while fagin thought the n he made a sign to sikes to tell nancy to leave the room don t worry sikes said you can trust her she won t talk isn t that right of course it s right answered the young woman taking a large drink from the bottle on the table and laughing anyway fagin i know your idea is for o liver to do the job you re a clever girl said fagin smiling evilly that s exactly what i had in mind listen bill the boy s been training for a few weeks and it s time he did some work he s the smallest one anyway is he safe asked sikes because if he tries any tricks on me i ll kill him he ll be ours for life if he feels he s one of us and this job will make him feel like that said fagin eagerly the boy looks so innocent he s perfect and we ve got to include him in some crime as soon as we can otherwise if he escapes now he can tell the police about us and stay free himself so it was decided that o liver would help sikes with the robbery in two days time the plan was discussed in great detail and all the arrangements made by the n sikes was very drunk and fagin got up to leave as he put on his coat he stared hard at nancy frowning a little no he was sure he could trust her she was loyal the next night o liver was alone in fagin s house when nancy entered she was so nervous and white faced that o liver asked her if she was ill god forgive me she said beating her hand s togethe r i never thought i would do this has anything happened asked the boy what is it she sat with her back to him and hid her face with her hand s after a while she said i don t know why i feel so strange sometimes come on o liver are you ready you have to come with me to bill s house why oh nothing important o liver did not believe her but he thought that at last this might be an opportunity to escape so he said rather too quickly i m ready nancy guessed what he was thinking o liver she said this is not the time to escape i ve saved you once and i will again but if anything happens tonight it might mean my death she said this so seriously that o liver decided it must be true he was quiet while they walked quickly through the streets to sikes house inside his room sikes sat o liver down on a chair did he come quietly he asked nancy quiet as a mouse glad to hear it said sikes now listen to me boy he put a gun against o liver s head if you say one word when you re outside with me i ll shoot you understand o liver nodded trying hard not to tremble sikes and o liver started out at five o clock in the morning while it was still dark they crossed from one side of london to the other at first the streets were empty the n shopsbegan to open and people started going to work gradually the noise and traffic increased and as they passed through the meat market at smithfield o liver was amazed by the sight and smells of so many animals and by the huge crowds of people all pushing and swearing and shouting but bill sikes marched on without stopping later in the day they were given a lift in a horse and cart from west london out into the country night fell and after walking a few more miles down country roads they finally arrived at an old house standing alone by a river it was dark and seemed to be empty they went inside without knocking inside were two other men who at sikes command produced food and drink for him and the boy the n sikes told o liver to get some sleep as they would be going out again later that night o liver still had no idea of the purpose of this expedition but his head ached with tiredness and he soon fell asleep at half past one the men got up and checked their equipment gathering several sticks as well sikes and the man called toby left the house togethe r with o liver walking between the m the re was now a thick fog and the night was very still as they hurried through the deserted streets of the nearby town out in the country again they walked down several small roads until finally they stopped at a house surrounded by a high wall as quick as lightning toby climbed up and pulled o liver after him inside the garden they crept towards the house and now for the first time o liver realized in horror that the purpose of the expedition was robbery and maybe even murder bill sikes broke open a small window at the back of the house the n shone his light into o liver s face now listen i m going to put you through here go straight through into the hall and on to the front door and let us in and if you don t you can be sure i ll shoot you o liver stupid with terror was lifted through the window into the house desperately he decided to try to run upstairs and warn the family he began to creep forwards suddenly the re was a loud noise from the hall come back shouted sikes back back o liver stood still frozen with fear a light appeared the n two men on the stairs the m a sudden bright flash and a loud bang o liver staggered back sikes seized the boy s collar through the window and pulled him back out into the garden they ve hit him shouted sikes he s bleeding a bell rang loudly above the noise of more gunshots and the shouts of men o liver felt himself being carried across rough ground and the n he saw and heard no more after the robbery the night was bitterly cold a sharp wind whipped the fallen snow up into the air and blew it into every hole and corner it was a night for the homeless to lie down and die and for luckier people to sit close to their fires and thank god they were at home in the workhouse where o liver was born mrs corney the widow in chargewas making tea by her fire when she heard a knock at her door she frowned and called out sharply come in the frown however was quickly changed to a sweet smile when she saw mr bumble enter hard weather mr bumble said the widow yes indeed ma am replied the beadle we ve had to give out to the poor people in this town great quantities of bread and cheese today and they re still complaining why one man even came back and demanded some free fire wood what does he want that for people are never satisfied give the m one thing today and tomorrow they ll ask for something else mrs corney agreed that it was very shocking they discussed some workhouse business togethe r and the n mr bumble looked hopefully at the teapot mrs corney offered him some tea instantly mr bumble sat down by the fire and gave the widow such a warm smile that her face turned a delicate pink she passed mr bumble the tea cup and as he took it he managed to give her hand a little stroke you re a kind hearted woman mrs corney said the beadle oh mr bumble said the widow smiling shyly for a while the re was a friendly silence between the m the n mr bumble moved his chair closer to the widow s mrs corney of course did not notice this but when the beadle s arm began to slide around her waist she felt she must make a small protest encouraged by this response mr bumble immediately gave her a kiss but at this interesting moment the re was a sudden knock at the door mr bumble jumped to his feet and went to the other end of the room please mrs corney said a voice outside old sally is going fast well what can i do to help her asked mrs corney angrily nothing ma am replied the old woman outside but she says she has something to tell you which you must hear she won t die quietly till you come complaining loudly mrs corney asked mr bumble to wait until she came back the n she followed the old woman up the stairs old sally lay in bed in a freezing cold room the fire was so small and mean that it gave no warmth at all mrs corney bent over the bed and the dying woman opened her eyes come closer she murmured let me whisper in your ear she held onto mrs corney s arm and pulled her down towards her in this same room i once helped a pretty young woman who came in with cut and bleeding feet who gave birth to a boy and the n died well asked mrs corney impatiently i robbed her she was hardly dead before i stole it stole what it the only thing she had it was gold it could have saved her life gold who was this mother tell me she told me to look after it when she died the old woman s mind was getting confused she trusted me poor girl and i stole it quick tell me or it may be too late said mrs corney greedily what was it and what was the boy s name the old woman could hardly speak o liver the gold i stole was yes yes what the old woman fell back onto the bed dead mrs corney hurried back to her room where mr bumble was still admiring her furniture and counting her silver tea spoons they sat down again by the fire and soon mr bumble s arm returned to its previous position round mrs corney s waist it was not long before he asked her to marry him and the widow happily accepted him while they drank to celebrate the arrangement mrs corney told mr bumble about old sally s death and the unknown gold object which she had stolen from the dead body of the young woman after many expressions of undying love mr bumble finally left the room and returned home with bright visions of his future while the se events were happening in the workhouse the artful dodger and charley bates were playing cards in fagin s house the dodger as usual was winning easily somehow he always seemed to know exactly what cards the other players had in their hand s suddenly the re was a faint ring on the bell downstairs and toby came in the man who had gone with bill sikes and o liver to rob the house in chertsey fagin jumped to his feet where are they he screamed sikes and the boy where are they hiding we failed said the robber what happened they fired and hit the boy we ran away with o liver between us and they chased us with dogs and the boy what about the boy gasped fagin his head was hanging down and he was cold we needed to go faster so we left him in a field alive or dead that s all i know about him fagin did not wait to hear any more he gave an angry scream ran out of the house and hurried through the streets until he reached bill sikes house as he climbed the stairs he thought well nancy if the re s anything going on here i ll find out about it however clever you are nancy was alone upstairs in her room her head on the table she s been drinking again thought fagin as he closed the door she woke up he told her what had happened during the robbery she said nothing and her head returned to the table and where do you think the boy is now my dear fagin asked her trying hard to see her face poor little child left alone like that nancy looked up i hope the child s dead the n he d be happier than any of us what said fagin in amazement it s better like that the sight of the boy turns me against myself and all of you you re drunk fagin suddenly lost his temper the boy s worth a fortune to me and now a drunken gang has lost him and if sikes doesn t return that boy to me dead or alive i ll tell the police about him and i ll get sikes hanged just remember that when fagin left her nancy was already back in a drunken sleep her head lying on the table once more fagin went out into the blackness of the night and walked home he had reached the corner of his street and was searching in his pocket for his key when a dark figure came out of the shadows and crossed the road towards him i ve been waiting here for two hours fagin said the stranger where have you been on your business my dear said fagin glancing at him uneasily we d better talk inside the door closed behind the m and they crept quietly up to the top floor in order not to wake the sleeping boys downstairs they sat in a dark room the only light coming from a candle burning in the passage outside the stranger s name was monks and he was in an evil mood he listened to fagin for a while frowning heavily it was badly planned he said angrily couldn t you have made the boy into an ordinary thief and the n got him arrested and sent out of the country for the rest of his life but he isn t like the other boys here fagin said i had nothing to frighten him with anyway i ve already helped you after he was caught by the police stealing from the book shop i got nancy to get him back and the n she felt sorry for him kill her monks said impatiently we can t afford to do that kind of thing said fagin but i can turn the boy into an ordinary thief now and the n nancy will harden her heart against him i know how women are but if he s already dead that s not my fault said monks quickly i always said to youdo anything you want to him but don t kill him i wouldn t have been able to forget it if you had suddenly he jumped to his feet staring at the wall opposite the door what s that he whispered terrified what where cried fagin the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman pass along that wall white faced they both ran from the room into the passage the candle threw long shadows down the stairs but the re was no one the re they listened only silence filled the house it was your imagination said fagin softly i swear i saw it replied monks they searched all the upstairs rooms they were empty and as quiet as death monks grew calmer and eventually left the house at one o clock in the morning the chase down at chertsey the previous night had not lasted long the re was a lot of noise of men shouting and dogs barking as the servants from the house pursued the robbers across the fields but sikes and toby wasted no time they dropped o liver s unconscious body in a field and disappeared into the fog and the darkness in different directions the three pursuers lost enthusiasm for the chase and agreed among themselves that it was much too dangerous to continue they returned to the house keeping close together and trying to look brave morning came but o liver still lay in the field as if dead it began to rain heavily and after a while o liver opened his eyes his left arm was covered in blood and hurting badly he felt so weak he could hardly stand but he knew that if he stayed where he was he would die gasping with pain he forced himself to his feet and with slow shaky steps began to walk he had no idea where he was going and moved forward mechanically as though in a dream after a while his feet found a road and he looked round and saw a house in the distance he decided he would rather die near human beings than in a cold field so he turned his steps towards the house as he came nearer he realized that the house was familiar and he felt faint with terror but where else could he go with a last effort he crawled up the path and knocked on the door the n fell exhausted on the step it was now mid morning inside the house the men servants were still describing the night s adventures to the cook and the servant girl who gasped with appreciative horror at every exciting moment they were all enjoying themselves very muchwhen the re came a knock at the door pale with fright they all stared at each other nobody was keen to answer the knock so eventually they all went including the dogs very cautiously they opened the door and saw nothing more alarming than poor o liver curled up in a sad little heap on the step the n one of the men gave a shout seized the boy by a leg and pulled him into the hall here he is he cried excitedly here s the thief i shot him last night a young lady appeared at the top of the stairs what s going on here quiet please is this poor boy very hurt very said the servant proudly the n one of you go to town as fast as you can and fetch a policeman and dr losberne the rest of you help to carry the boy upstairs and put him to bed treat him kindly i beg you o liver starts another life in a comfortable pleasant sitting room the two ladies of the house waited anxiously for the doctor and the police to arrive the owner of the house mrs may lie was an older woman but her niece rose was a girl of seventeen whose quiet beauty and gentle charm won all hearts as soon as the doctor arrived he ran breathlessly into the house and burst into the room without knocking he was clearly a good friend of the ladies i never heard of such a dreadful thing you should both be dead of fright he said to mrs may lie in the silence of the night too are you both all right why didn t you send for me at once we are quite all right said rose smiling but the re s an injured boy upstairs whom aunt wants you to see dr losberne went up to examine o liver and was the re for some time he came down looking rather puzzled and asked the two ladies to see the boy with him i can promise you the re s nothing very frightening about him he said instead of the evil looking robber they expected to see the two ladies found only a pale thin child lying peacefully asleep he looked to innocent that mrs may lie said this child could never have been in a gang of robbers it certainly seems strange agreed the doctor but wickedness can hide behind the most gentle face you know but he s so young too cried rose can you really believe this poor boy is a criminal oh dr losberne and my dear aunt i beg you both to have pity on him mrs may lie did not need persuading and the doctor could not resist rose s tears he had in fact an extremely kind heart which he tried to hide behind a quick fierce mannerthough this usually deceived no one well what s to be done the n he said quickly we ll have the police here at any moment ready to take the boy away and throw him into prison rose begged him to think of a plan and the doctor thought hard for a few minutes frowning fiercely at last he said i ve got it and rubbed his hand s together in satisfaction a little later o liver woke up and was very anxious to tell his story although he had lost a lot of blood and was very weak when the doctor and the ladies had heard all about his sad life they were quite sure that they wanted to save o liver from any unfair punishment so dr losberne went down to the kitchen to talk to the three servants who had surprised sikes and o liver during the robbery the doctor folded his arms and gave the men a long hard stare tell me he began can you be absolutely sure that the boy upstairs is the same one that was in the house last night well the doctor usually such a friendly man seemed so angry that the servants stared at him open mouthed the doctor gave the m no time to think and went on fiercely three men see a boy for about a second in the dark in the middle of a lot of smoke and noise a boy comes to the same house the next day and because one arm is injured they think he must be the robber are you going to swear that this is the same boy well what do you say he finished impatiently the servants looked at each other in great confusion suddenly the re was a ring at the gate the police officers had finally arrived dr losberne gave orders that plenty of beer should be served before the officers went up to see o liver he also made sure that the servants had a generous amount of beer too when the officers were finally allowed to see o liver dr losberne said this is a boy who was shot this morning while walking on a farmer s property where he shouldn t have been the servants saw him and immediately thought he must be the same boy from last night but now they say they re sure it s not the same boy the servants were by now so confused by beer and excitement that they were not sure of anything at all the robbers had certainly had a boy with the m they said but whether this boy was the same boy well it seemed very doubtful the police too had drunk quite a lot of beer by now and before long they were very willing to believe that o liver was not the robber of the night before they had their own ideas about who committed all the robberies in the area and o liver was unknown to the m at last the police left and o liver was allowed to recover in the kind care of mrs may lie rose and dr losberne it was several weeks before he was well enough to get out of bed but the n he quickly grew stronger and every day told his rescuers how grateful he was one thing however caused him unhappiness he wanted to find mr brown low the kind old man who had looked after him in london mr brown low would be pleased to know how happy i am now he said so when dr losberne offered to take o liver to london to see mr brown low the boy was very pleased they set out by coach one fine morning and when they arrived in london they went straight to mr brown low s house o liver s heart beat with excitement as they stopped outside but the house was empty they were told by the people next door that mr brown low had moved to the west indies six weeks before o liver was very disappointed he had thought about mr brown low so much recently and had always hoped to find him again but now the kind old man had moved abroad still believing o liver was a lying thief and he might hold this belief until the day he died this was a bitter disappointment to o liver but his new friends were still as kind to him as ever they left the house in chertsey and moved to a quiet cottage it the country taking o liver with the m spring came and in the fresh air away from the noise and smoke and trouble of the city o liver began a new life he went for walks with rose and mrs may lie or rose read to him and he worked hard at his lessons he felt as if he had left behind forever the world of crime and hardship and poverty life in the country the weeks slipped contentedly past and spring turned into summer o liver was now a strong and healthy boy and very fond of rose and mrs may lie as they were of him one hot summer evening after a walk in the country rose became very weak and pale and confessed she felt ill by the next morning she was in a dangerous fever and mrs may lie and o liver were afraid she might die mrs may lie sent o liver to the nearest town four miles away to post two express letters one was to dr losberne in chertsey the other to harry may lie mrs may lie s son o liver filled with anxiety ran as fast as he could along the country roads and across the fields until hot and exhausted he reached the town he posted the letters and turned to hurry home again as he was running past a pub in the main street he accidentally bumped into a tall man in black coming out the man stared at o liver what the devil s this he said stepping back i m sorry sir i was in a hurry and didn t see you the man murmured angrily to himself who would have thought it curse him i can t get away from him i m sorry sir repeated o liver frightened by the man s wild staring eyes the devil break your bones the man said through his teeth what are you doing here he raised his hand and started towards o liver with a mad look in his eyes but fell violently to the ground shaking and gasping in a fit people hurried up and helped the man into the pub while o liver thinking that the man was mad ran quickly home mrs may lie and o liver passed a sleepless night and rose grew steadily worse as the fever burned in her o liver said every prayer he had ever learnt ten times over late the next day dr losberne and harry may lie arrived and the house was full of worried faces and anxious whispers but the danger passed and by the next night dr losberne was able to announce that though seriously ill rose would not die o liver cried for joy a day or two later mrs may lie talked privately to her son harry was a hand some young man of about twenty five with a cheerful honest face and friendly manners he was clearly very fond of rose i know that you want to marry rose mrs may lie told her son and she is the nicest person i know but i want you to remember one thing her birth mother that means nothing to me said the young man i love her i know you do harry but she herself is well aware of her doubtful birth and this might affect her answer if you ask her to marry you i know you have ambitions to enter politics if you marry a woman with a stain on her name even though it s not her fault it might spoil your chances of success in life society is cruel harry people might use the knowledge of your wife s doubtful birth against you and against your children too and one day you might begin to regret your marriage only a selfish man would do that mother harry answered impatiently no i am quite determined i have loved rose for a long time and nothing will ever change that mrs may lie sighed and she i know is very fond of you but she herself may try to protect you and refuse an offer of marriage frpm you for your sake remember that harry but now i must go back and sit with her will you tell her how much i ve worried about her asked harry and how anxious i am to see her again of course i will replied mrs may lie some days after this conversation o liver was sitting in the room where he studied in the evenings it was a warm night and he had been studying hard for some hours he fell asleep at his desk and started dreaming he dreamt that he was in fagin s house again and could see the old man sitting in his corner whispering to another man yes my dear he heard fagin say you re right that s him in o liver s dream the other man answered of course it is i told you i d seen him i d recognize him anywhere if i walked across his unmarked grave i d know it was him buried under the ground he said this with such hatred that o liver woke up from fear in front of him at the open window so near he could almost touch the m were fagin and the strange wild man he had bumped into outside the pub in the town in a flash they were gone o liver sat still white with terror for a second the n shouted loudly for help harry and dr losberne came running and hearing what had happened they rushed outside into the night and searched the garden and the fields around the re was no sign of anybody it must have been a bad dream o liver said harry breathless after running through the fields he had heard all about o liver s past from his mother no replied o liver still frightened i saw the m both as plainly as i see you now nothing more was seen or heard of the two men and after a few days the event was forgotten rose recovered rapidly and was soon able to go outside again harry may lie waited a few days the n as his mother had expected he asked rose to marry him and as his mother had warned him rose refused don t you love me he asked her holding her hand i do she whispered but please try to forget me it would ruin your future as a politician if anybody found out about my birth i could never never forgive myself harry paused for a few minutes tell me one thing dear rose could you have accepted if your past had been different or if i had been poor and friendless with no hope of riches or success i could answered rose covering her face to hide her tears but as you are i can never be more than a friend to you i shall ask you once more said harry softly in a year s time or less i shall ask you to change your mind the girl shook her head and smiled sadly no it will be useless harry left the next day having asked o liver to write to him secretly with news of his mother and rose from an upstairs window rose watched him leave with tears in her eyes mr bumble was now a married man and not a happy one he was no longer a beadle but the manager of the workhouse and his wife formerly mrs corney scolded and argued with him day and night one evening after a particularly violent fight when she threw things at him and chased him out of the house he went for a walk alone through the town he felt very sorry for himself and finally went into a pub to find comfort in gin and water a tall dark man sitting in the corner watched mr bumble while he drank the stranger s clothe s were dusty and muddy as if he had travelled a long way mr bumble began to feel uncomfortable at the man s hard stare and tried to avoid meeting his eyes i ve seen you before the stranger said eventually you were the beadle here i was but i don t recognize you it doesn t matter i came here to look for you and i m lucky to have found you i d like some information he pushed a couple of coins across the table what information asked mr bumble suspiciously slipping the coins into his pocket about a workhouse birth a boy called o liver twist young twist i remember him he was a dreadful it s not him i want to talk about interrupted the stranger i ve heard enough of him it s the old woman who was the nurse for his mother where is she ohshe died last winter said mr bumble the n he remembered that his wife had been the re when old sally had died and he realized that this information might be worth something he told the man that one woman had been with the nurse when she died and had heard some secret from her where can i find this woman the stranger asked quickly showing in his pale face how important this was to him i can bring her to meet you tomorrow said mr bumble all right down by the river at nine in the evening the man wrote the address on a piece of paper and your name asked mr bumble monks replied the stranger but you don t need to remember it the n he quickly left the pub the next evening was dark and cloudy a storm threatened and already the first drops of rain were falling mr and mrs bumble walked up the main street of the town the n turned towards a group of ruined old houses next to the river mr bumble went first carrying a dim light and his wife followed closely behind at the oldest and most ruined building they stopped and mr bumble took out his piece of paper the first distant crash of thunder shook the air and the rain began to pour down heavily the n they heard monks calling out of an upstairs window is that the man mrs bumble asked her husband yes the n be careful to say as little as you can don t tell him i m your wife monks opened a small door saying impatiently come in don t keep me waiting mr bumble was only brave when dealing with poor helpless people he felt very uneasy about entering this dark building with an ill tempered stranger however he was equally afraid of his wife nervously he followed her through the door inside monks stared at mrs bumble for some time so this is the woman is it yes replied mr bumble cautiously as they walked upstairs the re was a bright flash of lightning outside followed by loud thunder they sat dowu at the table and monks started immediately so you were present when the old woman died is that right and she told you something he stared at mrs bumble again yes said mrs bumble something about the mother of o liver twist but first how much will you pay me for the information if it s what i want to hear twenty five pounds said monks but it s a lot of money for something which has been lying dead for twelve years reluctantly he pushed the money across the table towards her the n bent forward to listen the faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the table to hear what the woman had to say and the woman leant over towards the m so that they could hear her whisper in the dim lamplight their faces looked pale and ghostly the old woman who was the nurse died with only me in the room said mrs bumble no one else was the re asked monks fiercely no one good said monks go on she spoke about a young woman who had given birth in the same bed some years before the child was o liver twist and this nurse had robbed the child s mother robbed in life asked monks in death she stole from the body when it was hardly cold but the old woman fell back and died before she could tell memore it s a lie shouted monks furiously you know more i ll kill you both if you don t tell me what else she said she said no more repeated mrs bumble calmly showing unlike mr bumble no fear of the strange man s violence but in her hand i found a piece of dirty paper which contained nothing it was only a receipt from a pawnbroker i went to the pawnbroker and got back a little gold locket inside was a gold wedding ring and on the locket itself the name agnes she put the locket on the table in front of monks he picked it up immediately and looked at it closely his hand s shaking is this all it is and now i want to ask you a question what do youintend to do with the locket this so it can never be used against me monks suddenly pushed the table to one side and opened a small door in the floor down below rushed the river its muddy waters swollen by the heavy rain if you threw a man s body down the re where would it be to morrow asked monks twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces replied mr bumble in a shaky voice monks tied the locket to a heavy weight and dropped it in to the water in a second it was gone the three of the m lookedinto each other s faces and seemed to breathe more freely now we have nothing more to say said monks with athreatening look at mr bumble and nothing to say to any one else either do you understand certainly said mr bumble very politely he move da way from the strange man anxious to leave quickly at the door to the street monks turned again to mr bumble and if we ever meet again we don t know each other do you understand that as well perfectly said the relieved mr bumble moving away into the rain and pulling his wife with him nancy makes a visit on the evening after the bumbles little business meeting mr bill sikes waking from a sleep called out to ask the time the room he was lying in was very small and dirty it was a different room from the one he had occupied before the chertsey expedition but it was in the same poor part of london the re were so few possessions or comforts in the room that it was clear mr sikes had met hard times he himself was thin and pale from illness and was lying on the bed wrapped in an old coat the white dog lay on the floor next to him seated by the window was nancy repairing sikes old jacket she too was thin and pale at sikes voice she raised her head from her work not long past seven she said how do you feel now bill as weak as water help me get up will you as nancy helped him out of bed sikes swore and cursed a ther clumsiness illness had not improved his temper you would n t speak like that if you knew how kindly i ve nursed you the se last few days said nancy so many nights i ve looked after you she sat down in a chair exhausted get up shouted sikes what s wrong with you but nancy was unable to get up her head fell back against the chair and she fainted sikes swore and cursed again but nancy remained unconscious what s the matter here asked a voice from the door and fagin followed by the artful dodger and charley bates entered the room when they saw nancy they hurried to help her charley rubbed her hand s and the dodger gave her a drink from the bottle he carried gradually nancy recovered her senses sikes the n turned to fagin what are you here for he asked roughly you haven t been here for weeks all the time i was ill i haven t two coins to rub together why didn t you help me you treat me worse than a dog don t be bad tempered my dear said fagin calmly i haven t forgotten you bill well what about some money the n i ve done enough work for you recently what about some money i haven t a single coin with me my dear said fagin the n go and get some you ve got lots at home no i don t trust you nancy can go back with you to your house and fetch some money i ll stay here and sleep after a good deal of arguing fagin managed to reduce the amount sikes was demanding from five pounds to three pounds he went back to his house with nancy and the boys when they were inside fagin told the girl i ll just goupstairs and fetch the cash for bill my dear the re s little money in this business nancy little money and no thanksbut i m fond of seeing the young people around me suddenly the re was a man s voice at the front door as soon as nancy heard it she sat up in her chair that s the man i was expecting earlier said fagin don t worry he ll only be ten minutes the man entered the room it was monks when he saw nancy he moved back as if he had expected no one but fagin it s all right only one of my young people fagin said to him did you see him yes answered monks any news good news said monks with a smile let me have a word with you he and fagin went upstairs to talk privately as soon as they had left the room nancy took off her shoes and crept silently up the stairs to listen in the passage as she had done once before she was gone for a quarter of an hour the n like a ghost she reappeared in the downstairs room and sat down immediately afterwards the two men descended the stairs how pale you are nancy said fagin once monks had left the house what have you been doing to yourself nothing except waiting here for you too long she answered turning her face away from him now where s the money for bill with a sigh for every piece of money fagin put the agreed amount into her hand when nancy was out in the street again she sat down on a door step and for a few minutes seemed unable to move the n she started running wildly through the streets and when she was exhausted she stopped and burst into tears this strange mood seemed to leave her the n and she turned and hurried back to sikes house at first when she returned sikes noticed nothing unusual about her fagin with his sharp suspicious eyes would have noticed something at once but as night came the girl s nervous excitement increased and even sikes was alarmed by the paleness in her cheeks and the fire in her eye he lay in bed drinking hot gin and water and staring at her you look like a corpse that s come back to life again what s the matter with you tonight nothing why are you staring at me so hard either you ve caught the fever yourself or no you re not going to you wouldn t do that do what asked the girl the re s not a girl alive as loyal as you if you weren t i d have cut your throat months ago no you must have the fever coming on that s it now give me some of my medicine nancy quickly poured out his medicine with her back to him he took it and after turning restlessly for some time heeventually fell into a deep heavy sleep the drug s taken effect at last nancy said to herself as she rose from her position beside the bed i hope i m not too late quickly she put on her coat and hat looking round fearfully as if she expected at any moment to feel sikes heavy hand on her shoulder she kissed the robber s lips softly then ran from the house without a sound she hurried in the direction of west london pushing past people on the pavement and running across crowded streets with out looking the woman is mad said the people turning to look ather as she rushed past the m she came to a wealthier part of the town where the street swere quieter and before long she had reached her destination it was a family hotel in a quiet street near hyde park the clock struck eleven as she entered the man at the desk looked at her and asked what do you want here i want to see miss may lie the man looked at the young woman with strong disapproval she won t want to see someone like you come on get out let me see her or two of you will have to throw me out said nancy violently the man looked at her again and decided it would be easierto do as she asked he led her upstairs to rose s room nancy entered with a brave face but with fear in her heart please sit down and tell me why you wish to see me said rose may lie looking with some surprise at this poor rough girl from the streets rose s manner was so kind and sincere and so unexpected that nancy burst into tears when she had recovered a little she asked is the door shut yes answered rose a little nervously but why because i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hand s i am the girl that kidnapped little o liver and took him back to old fagin s house on the night o liver was going to the bookseller you said rose yes it was me i am that wicked creature you have hear dab out i ve no friends except thieves and robbers i ve lived on the streets since i was a child cold hungry among people who are always drunk and fighting and that s where i ll die too i pity you said rose in a broken voice but i ll tell you why i m here do you know a man called monks no answered rose he knows you i heard him tell fagin that you were at this hotel maybe he s changed his name soon after o liver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i listened insecret to a conversation between monks and fagin in the dark and i heard monks say that he d seen o liver in the street and that he knew at once o liver was the child he was looking for although i couldn t hear why monks the n agreed to pay fagin some money if he could find o liver again and more money if he could turn the poor boy into a thief why asked rose he saw my shadow on the wall as i listened and i had to escape i didn t see him again until last night and what happened the n i listened at the door again and i heard monks say this so the only proof of the boy s identity is at the bottom of the river and the old woman who received it is dead he and fagin laughed the n monks said that he had all o liver s money safely now but how funny it would be if the boy went to prison for stealing after his father s unfair will what is all this asked rose it s the truth lady the n monks said he couldn t have o liver killed because suspicion would point to himself bu the d try for the rest of his life to harm the boy if he could the n monks laughed again about the money o liver should have got from his father s will my young brother o liver will n ever see that money he said his brother exclaimed rose those were his words said nancy looking round uneasily as if she still expected to see sikes and the n hetalked about how amazed you would be if you knew who o liver really was and this man was serious his voice was full of anger and hatred i know many people who do worse things but i d rather listen to all of the m than to this man monks but i must get back now or people will wonder where i ve been back how can you go back to such a life asked rose you ve told me all this now i can help you by letting you stay somewhere safe no perhaps it s hard for you to believe but the re s one man the most dangerous of the m all that i can never leave you re the first person who s ever spoken to me so kindly but it s too late it s never too late it is cried the girl i can t leave him now and if i tell anyone about this man he ll die but how can i find you again when we want to investigate this mystery further i ll meet you secretly if you promise not to watch or follow me said nancy and if you promise just one more thing not to do anything to hurt the man i can never leave i promise every sunday night between eleven and twelve i will walk on london bridge if i am alive meet me the re if youwant more information as nancy said the se words she left the room and ran down the stairs and out into the street once more rose was left alone her thoughts in great confusion as she wondered desperately what to do and who to ask for advice the next morning o liver who had been out walking ranin to rose s room at the hotel he was breathless with excitement i can t believe what i ve seen now you ll all know that i ve told you the truth he shouted i know you ve always told us the truth but what are you talking about asked rose i ve seen mr brown low the kind man who was so good tome where going into a house said o liver crying with joy i ve got the address here quick said rose call a coach i ll take you there immediately the idea came to rose that perhaps mr brown low would advise her she had been afraid to tell nancy s story to dr losberne since the good doctor was very excitable and often acted with more enthusiasm than wisdom in less than five minutes they were in the coach on their way to the address rose went in first to talk to mr brown low alone she was taken into his study and polite greetings were exchanged when they were seated again rose said this will surprose you very much but you were once very kind to a dear friend of mine and i m sure you will be interested to hear news of him really may i ask you his name o liver twist mr brown low said nothing for a few seconds but simply stared at rose finally he moved his chair nearer to her and said with great feeling i once thought that he was a liar and a thief if you have evidence to show me i was wrong please tell me at once i know him to be a child with a warm heart said rose and despite the hardships of his life he s a better person than almost anyone i know i looked for him everywhere said mr brown low but i could never find him i could never quite believe that he really did intend to rob me rose told him everything that had happened to o liver since the n she finished by saying and his only sorrow for some months has been that he could not find you his former friend thank god said mr brown low this is great happiness to me great happiness but why haven t you brought him with you miss may lie he s waiting in a coach at the door replied rose mr brown low hurried out of the room down the stairs and into the coach without another word in a minute he had returned with o liver how well he looks he said new clothe s the same sweet face but not so pale the same eyes but not so sad they talked with great joy for some time the n mr brown low sent for mrs bed win the old housekeeper she came in quietly and waited for her orders you get blinder every day said mr brown low impatiently people s eyes at my time of life don t improve with age replied the old lady the n put on your glasses as she searched for the m in her pocket o liver could not wait any longer and ran into her arms dear god she said it s my innocent boy my dear old nurse cried o liver i knew he would come back said the old lady holding him in her arms how well he s dressed how well he looks again she laughed and cried at the same time and could not let o liver go while o liver talked to mrs bed win rose asked mr brown low if she could speak to him privately he led her in to another room and the re listened with a good deal of amaze ment to rose s account of her extraordinary conversation with nancy between the m they decided that mrs may lie and dr losberne should be told and that mr brown low would come to the hotel that evening for a discussion for the moment nothing would be said to o liver himself that evening at the hotel o liver s four friends met as arranged dr losberne of course was full of immediate plans to rush round london arresting all the gang and hanging the mat once mr brown low fortunately was able to persuade him to abandon this wild idea the n what s to be done cried the doctor impatiently first said mr brown low calmly we must discover who he inheritance that should have been his yes yes said the doctor nodding in agreement but how shall we achieve the se aims we must find this man monks said mr brown low nancy will not betray the man who is special to her but she will surely agree to tell us how or where to find monks then we must find a way to force monks to talk we must be both cautious and clever after all we have no proof against him and if we cannot make him talk this mystery will never be solved but we ll have to wait five days until sunday before we can meet nancy on london bridge until the n we can do nothing nancy keeps an appointment on exactly the same night as nancy had met rose may lie two people from o liver s home town were making their way towards london their progress was slow since they travelled on foot and in addition the girl was carrying a heavy bag on her back the young man carried nothing from time to time he turned to shout at the girl behind him hurry up what a lazy creature you are charlotte i ll come and give you a kick if you don t move faster the young man was noah claypole who had made o liver s life so miserable at mr sowerberry s house he was now taller and uglier but otherwise little changed he and charlotte had grown tired of the undertaking business and had set off to london to start a new life with all the money from mr so wer berry s shop in their pockets eventually they entered london and noah began to look for a quiet cheap pub where they could spend the night charlotte followed obediently at his heels as they walked through a district of narrow dirty streets at last noah found a pub that he thought was suitable it was dark and dirty with a few rough looking men in the bar they entered and asked for a room for the night and a meal of cold meat and beer which they ate in the bar the beer madenoah talkative and he began to boast so it s no more coffins for us my girl we can do better than just robbing mr so wer berry in london the re are pockets houses coaches even banks i like the sound of it noah but how are we going to do all this asked charlotte we can meet people who know about the se things i d like to be the leader of some gang if the re s a good profit to be made in that kind of work noah felt very pleased with himself and looked forward to an easy life of crime in the capital they talked about their plans for a few minutes the n astranger who had been sitting unseen round the corner cameup to the m the stranger was fagin he greeted the m in avery friendly and cheerful way sat down with the m and immediately ordered more beer for noah that s good beer said noah already a little drunk he thanked the stranger for the drink expensive too said fagin if you drink that everyday my dear you ll need to empty pockets houses coaches even banks when he heard his own words repeated noah went pale with terror the stranger must have heard everything even how they had robbed mr so wer berry don t worry laughed fagin pulling his chair closer you re lucky it was only me who heard you i didn t take it said noah quickly it was the woman who did it it does n t matter who did it my dear replied fagin looking quickly at charlotte because i m in that business myself and the people in my house as well i can in trod uce you to the right people if you re interested you both look like good workers charlotte and noah felt a mixture of fear and pleasure what would you want me to do asked noah some thing light if possible he added what about spying on people asked fagin or robbing young children who are going shopping for their mothers that s light work and easy noah laughed that sounds like just the thing for me and what will i earn for this work you can live free in my house and give me half of what you earn after fur the r discussion and the transfer of mr so wer berry s money from noah s pocket to fagin s agreement was reached the next day noah and charlotte went to live in fagin s house and began to be instructed in their new profession although training and experience had made nancy an exper tliar she could not completely hide the fear in her mind she knew she had taken an enormous risk in going to see rosemay lie if fagin or sikes ever found out but she pushed the se fears away she was determined to keep her promise to rose may lie and meet her as arranged on the first sunday night after her meeting with rose she was in sikes room when the clock struck eleven fagin was the re too discussing some business with sikes nancy stood up and put on her coat sikes watched her surprised nancy where are you going at this time of night not far what kind of answer is that where are you going i don t know replied the girl the n i do nowhere sit down i m not well i want a breath of air sikes got up and locked the door let me go said the girl with great force just for one hour let me go sikes seized her arms roughly the girl s gone mad nancy fought wildly and sikes had to hold her down in a chair she continued to scream and fight until midnight when exhausted and tearful she stopped struggling she went into another room and threw herself on a bed she s a strange girl sikes said to fagin shaking his head why did she suddenly decide to go out tonight it hought that after all the se years i d finally tamed her she must be ill perhaps she s still got a bit of fever that must be it said fagin nodding thoughtfully as he walked home fagin s eyes were sharp with suspicion he had suspected for a while that nancy had become tired of bill sikes brutality and violence and that she had found a new friend to take his place her manner was different she often left home alone and she seemed lessinterested in the gang and tonight her desperate impatience to go out at a particular hour he was certain he was right he began to make plans first he wanted to know who nancy s new friend was he could make him a valuable new member of the gang with nancy as his assistant but the re was another darker reason fagin too had become tired of sikes sikes knew too much too many dangerous secrets about fagin himself fagin distrusted everybody but he hated and distrusted sikes most of all it would be very convenient if sikes could be removed with a little persuasion fagin thought perhaps the girl would poison sikes suddenly his eyes narrowed in delight yes first i must have her watched and find out who her new man is the n i shall threaten to tell sikes everything she knows that neither she nor her new man will ever be safe from sikes violent jealousy she will have no choice except to do as i ask her and the n once the murder is done she will be in my power for ever early next morning fagin called the newest member of his gang noah was doing very well he had already broughthome quite a lot of money he had found that robbing small children was indeed light easy work and he was proud of his success i have another job for you now fagin told him it needs great care and secrecy i want you to follow a woman i want to know where she goes who she sees and if possible what she says i will pay you a pound for this information noah s eyes were wide with greed i m the right man forthis job who is she one of us what you don t trust her the n exactly so my dear exactly so smiled fagin the following sunday soon after eleven o clock a woman walked quickly through the dark streets towards lond on bridge a mist hung over the river and the buildings on the far bank could hardly be seen a man followed some distance behind her keeping to the darkest shadows it was a cold damp night and the re were very few people on the streets at this late hour when the woman reached the centre of the bridge she stopped and looked around anxiously the man following hers topped too the heavy bell of st paul s cathe dral rang out announcing the death of another day just as it finished agrey haired man and a young woman got out of a coach and walked across the bridge they met the woman who tookthe m down some steps leading to the river bank they stood indeep shadow by the wall of the bridge the man hurried down some other steps crept up to the corner of the wall and listened nancy spoke first i m so frightened tonight i can hardly breathe frightened of what asked mr brown low he seemed topity her i wish i knew horrible thoughts of death and blood have been with me all day i don t know why speak to her kindly said rose to mr brown low poorgirl she seems to need it i could n t come last sunday continued the girl i was kept in by force but tonight he ll be out all night untilday light now before i tell rou anything else i must tell you that i don t want fagin or any of the other members of the gang to be hand ed to the police why not because i couldn t betray the m they ve been loyal to me and i ll stay loyal to the m the n just tell us how we can get monks and i promisen one of your friends will be harmed said mr brown low and monks will never know how you found out about him she asked we promise said rose gently nancy the n told the m in so low a voice that the listenerround the corner could hardly hear her where monks often went for a drink and what he looked like she finished by saying on his throat high up the re is a bright red mark asked mr brown low do you know him asked nancy in surprise i think i do mr brown low murmured to himself it must be him the n more loudly he said to nancy thank you for everything you ve told us but now how can you go back to the se people come with us now tonight we canarr ange for you to be hidden from the m all forever if you want us to the girl shook her head i m chained to him bad as theyare i ve gone too far to change my life now she looked nervously over her shoulder i can feel those dreadful terrors again visions of blood and death i must go home mr brown low and rose could not persuade her to change her mind sadly they turned to leave and when they had gone nancy fell to the ground in a storm of tears meanwhile noah claypole amazed by all that he had heard crept up the steps and ran for fagin s house as fast as his legs could carry him some hours later nearly two hours before dawn noah laya sleep in fagin s house but fagin sat silently by a dead fire staring at the flame of a candle on tne table beside him with his pale wrinkled face and his red staring eyes he looked like a devil out of hell hatred ran like poison through hisevery thought hatred for the girl who had dared to talk to strangers who had ruined his plan to get rid of sikes he did not believe her promise not to betray him and he feared that he would now be caught and hung just before dawn sikes entered the room carrying a bundle which contained the results of his night s work fagin took what sikes gave him the n stared at the robber for a long time with out speaking why are you looking at me like that asked sikes uneasy at the old man s strange expression fagin raised his hand but his passion was so great that hecould not speak say something will you shouted sikes placing his huge hand on fagin s collar and shaking him in his anger and fear open your mouth and say what you ve got to say eventually fagin found his voice bill what would you do if one of the gang went out at night and told someone all about us and what we d done what would you do to him i d smash his head into little pieces said the robber swearing violently and what if it was me who knows so much about all ofus and could put us all in prison and get us all hanged whispered fagin his eyes flashing with hate i d beat your brains out in public even in the law court i d run over and kill you with my bare hand s said sikes showing his teeth in his anger i don t care who it was that s what i d do fagin woke noah tell bill what you told me what you saw what she did tell him noah rubbed the sleep from his eyes and told sikes every thing his face white with passion sikes listened to the end the n swearing furioustly he rushed from the room and down the stairs bill fagin called after him you won t be too violent sikes made no reply but pulling open the door ran out into the silent streets he did not turn his head to right or left but looked straight in front of him with wild determination he ran at great speed his eyes on fire his teeth tight together and did not pause until he reached his own door he ran up to his room entered and locked the door put a table against it the n woke nancy bill she said pleased to see him but when she saw his expression the colour went out of her face what s the matter she said in alarm you know what sikes took out his gun but realizing even in his madness that a shot might be heard he beat her twice across the face with it as hard as he could she fell with low cry of pain and terror almost blinded by the blood that flowed from the cut on her forehead the murderer staggered to a corner seized a heavy stick and struck her down the end of the gang the sun burst upon the crowded city in all its brightness it lit up every corner of london the great houses of the rich and the miserable homes of the poor its hone everywhere even into the room where the murdered woman lay the horror of that scene was even more dreadful in the clear morning light sikes sat the re unable to move looking at the body he had thrown the blood covered stick into the fire the n washed himself and his clothe s he had cut out the bits of his clothes that were stained and burnt the m too but the re were still bloodstains all over the floor even the dog s feet were bloody finally he forced himself to leave the room pulling the dog out with him and locking the door behind him he walked rapidly north towards high gate the n on to hampstead on the open land of hampstead heath away from people and houses he found a place in a field where he could sleep with out being disturbed but before long he was up again and running this time heran back towards london for a while the n he turned and went north again sometimes walking sometimes running with no clear purpose in his mind eventually he felt hungry and changed direction towards hendon a quiet place away from the crowds where he could buy food but even the children and chickens the re seemed to look at him with suspicion so he turned back towards hampstead heath again without having eaten uncertain where to go at last he turned north again his dog still running at his heels and set off to a village just outside london he stopped at a small quiet pub and bought a meal the n went on again it was now dark and as he continued walking he felt as if nancy were following him her shadow on the road her last low cry in the wind if he stopped the ghostly figure did the same if he ran it ran too moving stiffly like a corpse sometimes he turned determined to drive the ghost away but his blood ran cold with terror every time he turned the ghost turned too and was still behind him finally he found another field where he could hide he lay down unable to sleep his mind filled with visions of the dead girl her wide dead eyes stared at him watching him through a curtain of blood suddenly he heard shouting in the distance he jumped to his feet and saw that the sky seemed on fire sheets of flame shot into the air driving clouds of smoke in his direction he heard an alarm bell and more shouts of fire running with his dog across the fields he joined the crowds of men and women fighting the fire he could forget his own terror in this new danger and he worked all night with the crowd shouting running and working togethe r to stop the flames destroying more buildings in the morning the mad excitement was over and the dreadful memory of his crime returned more terrifying than ever in desperation he decided to go back to london at least the re ll be somebody i can speak to he thought to himself and it s a better hiding place than out here in the country i ll hide the re for a week get some money out of fagin the n escape to france suddenly he remembered the dog people would be looking for his dog as well as himself he decided to drown the animal but the dog smelt the man s fear and turned and ran away from him faster than it had ever run in its life you have a choice mr monks said mr brown low you have been kidnapped and brought here to my house you can either tell me what i want to know or i ll have you arrested instantly for fraud and robbery it s your choice and you must decide now at once monks hesitated and looked at the old man but mr brown low s expression was so serious and determined that the younger man realized it was pointless to protest i didn t expect this treatment from my father s oldest friend said monks angrily sitting down with a frown on his face yes i was your father s oldest friend said mr brown low and i know all about you how your father while still a boy was forced by his family into an unhappy marriage with an older woman and how you were the result of that marriage i also know that your parents separated hating each other by the end well what s so important about that when they d been separated for ten years said mr brown low your father met another family the re were two daughters one nineteen years old and the other only two or three your father became engaged to the older daughter at this point one of his rich relations died and left him a lot of money in his will your father had to travel to italy to receive his inheritance and while the re he became ill and died your mother who was living with you in paris immediately rushed to italy when she heard the news as your father had made no will of his own all the relation s money came to you and her monks listened with close attention biting his lip and staring at the floor before your father went to receive that money he came to see me continued mr brown low slowly his eyes fixed on monks face i never heard that before said monks looking up suddenly a suspicious expression on his face he left me a picture of the poor girl he wanted to marry he talked wildly about shame and guilt and how he would give part of the money he d inherited to his wife and to you and use the rest to escape from england with the girl he loved he refused to tell me any more details monks breathe d more easily and even smiled but said mr brown low pulling his chair nearer to the other man by chance i was able to rescue your brother o liver from a life of misery and what cried monks mr brown low continued without a pause and when he was recovering from his sickness here in my house i noticed how similar he looked to the girl s face in the picture but he was taken away before i could discover his history as you know very well you can t prove anything said monks i can i heard that you were in the west indies i went the re to try and find you to see if you knew anything about o liver but you d already left i returned to london and was unable to find you until two hours ago and now what you can t prove that o liver s my brother monks smiled unpleasantly i couldn t before said mr brown low standing up but now i can the re was a will but your mother destroyed it this will mentioned a child that would be born later this was o liver the child you met later by accident you noticed his resemblance to your father and you became suspicious you the n went back to his birthplace found proof of his birth and the fact that he s your half brother and destroyed that proof monks sat in silence his eyes filled with fear yes continued mr brown low fiercely shadows on the wall have caught your whispers with fagin and brought the m to my ear for the sake of that innocent child whom you wanted to destroy and now murder had been done and you are as guilty of that as if you had struck the blow yourself no no said monks quickly i knew nothing of that nothing at all he was silent for a while realizing how much was known about him hatred and fear fought inside him but he was a coward at heart at last seeing no escape he raised his head i will admit everything in front of witnesses if necessary mr brown low nodded coldly i will prepare a document for you to sign you must give o liver what is really his and the n you can go where you please at that moment dr losberne rushed into the room the murderer will be taken tonight his dog s been found and fagin asked mr brown low they re sure of him they may have him already mr brown low turned back to monks have you made up your mind yes replied monks and you promise it ll remain a secret no police or charges of fraud against me yes said mr brown low

the doctor and they eagerly discussed the news of the hunt for the criminals my blood boils with anger said mr brown low this poor murdered girl must be revenged you stay here and guard monks i ll go out and get the latest news the two men parted each in a fever of excitement down by the river thames was a district called rotherhithe one of the dirtiest and roughest places in london the houses next to the river had no owners they were broken down and ruined but could be defended against attack in an upper room of one of the se houses were three members of fagin s gang when was fagin taken the n asked the man called toby two o clock this afternoon charley and i escaped up the chimney but noah was caught bet went to see nancy and when she saw the body she started screaming and wouldn t

seen him when he was caught said another robber the police carried him through the crowd while all the people jumped at him screaming and trying to attack him suddenly sikes dog ran into the room all the robbers rushed out immediately to look for sikes but the re was no sign of him they returned to the upstairs room i hope he s not coming here said toby the dog s come a long way said another man covered in mud and tired out they sat the re in silence wondering where sikes was it was already dark when they heard a sudden hurried knock at the door downstairs toby went to the window to look down the n pulled his head back in his face pale with fear the re was no need to tell tlec others who it was we must let him in said toby although none of the m wanted to see him toby went down to the door and returned followed by sikes white faced with a three day old beard hollow cheeks and staring eyes sikes looked like a ghost no one said a word nothing to say to me sikes asked the only answer was a low shout of many voices from outside in the distance coming closer lights appeared looking out sikes saw a stream of people crossing the bridge towards the m the n the re was a loud knocking on the door and more shouts from the crowd the doors are made of metal and they re locked and chained said toby the three robbers watched sikes nervously as if he were a wild animal bring a ladder shouted some of the crowd below give me a rope quick sikes said to the others i ll go the other way climb down the back and escape over the river get me a rope now or i ll do three more murders a minute later sikes appeared on the roof and the shouts from the crowd below swelled to a great roar the n the front door was smashed down and people streamed into the house sikes quickly tied the rope around the chimney the n began to tie the other end around himself ready to lower himself to the ground behind the house but just as he put the rope over his head he screamed in terror and threw his arms above his head he staggered back slipped and fell over the edge of the roof as he fell the rope tightened around his neck with a horrible jerk in a second the murderer was dead and the re he hung his body swinging gently from side to side the dog which had followed its master onto the roof jumped down towards the lifeless body missed and fell dead on the stones below the end of the mystery the next day o liver travelled with mr brown low dr losberne mrs may lie and rose back to his birthplace he had been told a little of his history and knew that the re would be more explanations at the end of this journey he was anxious and uncertain wondering what he would hear but towards the end of the journey he began to recognize familiar places and in great excitement pointed the m out to rose the re was the path he had taken when he had run away the re across the fields was the baby farm the n as they drove into the town he saw the house of mr so wer berry the undertaker and the workhouse that had been his prison they stopped at the biggest hotel in the town and went in to their rooms during dinner mr brown low stayed in a separate room and the older members of the group went in and out with serious faces mrs may lie came back with her eyes red from crying all this made rose and o liver who had not been told any new secrets very nervous and uncomfortable at nine o clock dr losberne and mr brown low brought monks into the room o liver was very surprised this was the same man he had bumped into once outside a pub and seen another time with fagin looking in at him through the window of the country cottage o liver was told that monks was his half brother and the boy stared at him in shock and amazement monks looked back at him with hatred we have the whole story here in the se papers said mr brown low putting the m on the table all we need now is for you to sign the m monks and to tell o liver what happened monks started hesitantly my father had arrived in italy to collect the money he had inherited when suddenly he fell ill when he died we found two papers in his desk one was a letter to his girl the other was a will what was the letter asked mr brown low it was written when he was ill telling the girl how ashamed he was that she was pregnant he asked her not to remember him as a bad man but as someone who had made a mistake he reminded her of the day he d given her the locket and ring o liver s tears fell fast as he listened to the story of his father and what about the will asked mr brown low monks was silent the will continued mr brown low speaking for him was in the same spirit as the letter he talked of the misery of his marriage to his wife and the evil character of you monks his only son who had been brought up by your mother to hate him he left you and your mother an annual income of the rest of his property he left to his girl agnes and to their child if it were born alive and if it showed itself to be of a good kind character the money would only go to you monks as the older son if the younger turned out to be as evil as you my mother said monks burnt this will and never sent the letter the girl agnes left her home in secret so that her pregnancy would not bring shame on her family i swore to my mother when she was dying that if i ever found my half brother i would do him all the harm i could he would feel my hatred like a whip on his back i paid fagin to trap o liver into a life of crime but the n he escaped and that stupid interfering girl nancy talked to you if i d had the chance i would have finished what i d begun monks stared at o liver and his lips moved in a silent curse and the locket and ring asked mr brown low i bought the m from mr and mrs bumble who had stolen the m from the nurse who had stolen the m from agnes the dead girl i ve already told you how i threw the m into the river mr brown low turned to rose i have one more thing to explain he said to the girl i don t know if i have the strength to hear it now she murmured having heard so much already mr brown low put his hand under her arm you have a great deal of courage dear child he said kindly he turned to monks do you know this young lady sir yes i don t know you said rose faintly the father of poor agnes had two daughters said mr brown low what happened to the other one who was only a young child at the time when agnes disappeared replied monks her father changed his name and moved to a lonely place in wales where no one would know about the family shame he died very soon afterwards and this young daughter was taken in by some poor people my mother hated agnes and everybody connected with her she hunted for this young sister and made sure that her life would be unhappy she told the poor people who had taken her in that the girl was illegitimate and that she came from a bad family with an evil reputation so the child led a life of miserable poverty until mrs may lie saw her by chance pitied her and took her home and do you see this young sister now asked mr brown low yes standing by your side rose could hardly speak so o liver is my nephew i can never call you aunt cried o liver you ll always be my own dear sister they ran into each other s arms both of the m crying in their happiness a father sister and mother had been lost and gained and it was too much for one evening they stood for a long time in silence and the others left the m alone the court was full of faces from every corner all eyes were on one man fagin in front of him behind above below he seemed surrounded by staring eyes not one of the faces showed any sympathy towards him all were determined that he should hang at last the re was a cry of silence and everyone looked towards the door the jury returned and passed close to fagin he could tell nothing from their faces they could have been made of stone the n the re was complete stillness not a whisper not a breath guilty the whole court rang with a great shout echoing through all the rooms as the crowd ran out of the building to tell all the people waiting outside the news was that he would die on monday fagin thought of nothing but death that night he began to remember all the people he had ever known who had been hung he could hardly count the m they might have sat in the same prison cell as he was sitting in now he thought about death by hanging the rope the cloth bag over the head the sudden change from strong men to bundles of clothe s hanging at the end of a rope as his last night came despair seized fagin s evil soul he could not sit still and hurried up and down his small cell gasping with terror his eyes flashing with hate and anger the n he lay trembling on his stone bed and listened to the clock striking the hours where would he be when those hours came round again in the middle of that sunday night mr brown low and o liver were allowed to enter the prison several strong doors were unlocked and eventually they entered fagin s cell the old robber was sitting on the bed whispering to himself his face more like a trapped animal s than a human s you have some papers fagin said mr brown low quietly which were given to you by monks to look after it s a lie replied fagin not looking at him i haven t got any for the love of god said mr brown low very seriously don t lie to us now on the night before your death you know that sikes is dead and monks has confessed where are the papers i ll tell you o liver said fagin come here he whispered to him they re in a bag up the chimney in the front room at the top of the house but i want to talk to you my dear yes said o liver will you pray with me outside outside said fagin pushing the boy in front of him towards the door say i ve gone to sleep they ll believe you you can take me out with you when you go the old man s eyes shone with a mad light it s no good said mr brown low taking o liver s hand he s gone too far and we can never reach him now the cell door opened and as the visitors left fagin started struggling and fighting with his guards screaming so loudly that the prison walls rang with the sound they left the prison building in the grey light of dawn outside in the street huge crowds were already gathering joking and laughing and pushing to get the best places near the great black platform where the rope hung ready for its morning s work less than three months later rose married harry may lie for her sake harry had abandoned his political ambitions and had become a simple man of the church the re was no longer any mystery about rose s birth but even if the re had been harry would not have cared they lived next to the church in a peaceful village mrs may lie went to live with the m and spent the rest of her days in quiet contentment mr brown low adopted o liver as his son they moved to a house in the same quiet village and were just as happy dr losberne discovered suddenly that the air in chertsey did not suit him in less than three months he too had moved to a cottage just outside the village where he took up gardening and fishing with great energy and enthusiasm mr brown low suggested that half the remaining money from the will should be given to monks and the other half to o liver although by law it should all have gone to o liver alone o liver was glad to accept the suggestion monks went off with his money to the other side of the world where he spent it quickly and was soon in prison for another act of fraud in prison he became ill and died the remaining members of fagin s gang died in similar ways in other distant countries all except charley bates who turned his back on his past life of crime and lived honestly as a farmer noah claypole was given a free pardon for telling the police about fagin he soon became employed as an informer for the police spying on people and telling the police about anyone who had broken the law mr and mrs bumble lost their jobs and became poorer and poorer eventually living in poverty in the same workhouse that they had once managed in that quiet country village theyears passed peacefully mr brown low filled the mind of his adopted son with knowledge and as he watched the boy grow up he was reminded more and more of his old friend o liver s father the two orphans rose and o liver led lives that were truly happy the hardships that they had once suffered had left no bitterness in their gentle souls and all their lives they showed the mercy and kindness to others that god himself shows to all things that breathe txtba www txtba com txtba www txtba com the maiden one evening at the end of may a middle aged man was walking home from shaston to the village of marlott in the vale of blackmoor his legs were thin and weak and he could not walk in a straight line he had an empty egg basket on his arm and his hat was old and worn after a while he passed an elderly parson riding a grey horse good night said the man with the basket good night sir john said the parson after another step or two the man stopped and turned round to speak to the parson now sir last market day we met on this road at the same time and i said good night and you answered good night sir john as you did just now i did said the parson and once before that almost a month ago i may have so why do you call me sir john when i am only john durbeyfield the parson rode nearer and after a moment s hesitation explained it was because i ve discovered something of historical interest i am parson tringham the historian do you really not know durbeyfield that you are a direct descendant of the ancient and noble family of the d urbervilles they descended from sir pagan d urberville who came from normandy with william the conqueror in never heard that before sir well it s true let me see your face yes you have the d urberville nose and chin d urbervilles have owned land and served their king for hundreds of years there have been many sir johns and you could have been sir john yourself well exclaimed the man and how long has this news about me been known parson tringham nobody knows about it at all said the parson i just happened to discover it last spring when i was trying to find out more about the d urbervilles and noticed your name in the village i ve got an old silver spoon and an old seal too at home said the man wondering so where do we d urbervilles live now parson you don t live anywhere you have died as a noble family that s bad so where do we lie in the churchyard at kingsbere sub greenhill and where are our family lands you haven t any john durbeyfield paused and what should i do about it sir oh nothing it s a fact of historical interest nothing more good night but you ll come and have some beer with me parson tringham no thank you not this evening durbeyfield you ve had enough already the parson rode away half regretting that he had told durbeyfield of his discovery durbeyfield walked on a few steps in a dream then sat down with his basket in a few minutes a boy appeared durbeyfield called to him boy take this basket i want you to go and do something for me the boy frowned who are you john durbeyfield to order me about and call me boy you know my name as well as i know yours do you do you that s the secret well fred i don t mind telling you that the secret is that i m one of a noble family and durbeyfield lay back comfortably on the grass sir john d urberville that s who i am and i ve got the family seal to prove it oh now take up the basket and tell them in the village to send a horse and carriage to me immediately here s a shilling for you this made a difference to the boy s view of the situation yes sir john thank you sir john as they spoke sounds of music came through the evening air from the village what s that said durbeyfield have they heard my news already it s the women dancing sir john the boy went on his way and durbeyfield lay waiting in the evening sun nobody passed by for a long time and he could just hear the faint music in the distance the village of marlott lies in the beautiful vale of blackmoor although this valley is only four hours away from london it has not yet been discovered by tourists and artists the best view of the vale is from the hills surrounding it it looks like a map spread out it is a quiet sheltered part of the countryside where the fields are always green and the rivers never dry up to the south lies the great dividing line of hills from here to the coast the hills are open the sun pours down on the huge dry fields the atmosphere is colourless but here in the valley lies a completely different countryside smaller and more delicate the fields are tiny the air makes you sleepy the sky is of the deepest blue everywhere you can see a rich greenery of grass and trees covering smaller hills and valleys this is the vale of blackmoor and in the village of marlott following ancient custom the young women gathered to dance every holiday for this mayday dance all wore white dresses there was a fine handsome girl among them with a red ribbon in her hair as they danced they noticed a carriage go by durbeyfield lay back in it singing i m sir john and i ve got a spoon and seal and my family lies at kingsbere the girl with the ribbon who was called tess turned red and said quickly to her friends father s tired that s all the other girls just laughed but stopped when tess looked unhappy the dancing went on in the evening the men of the village came to watch and later to join the dancers three young strangers who were passing by also stopped to look they explained they were brothers on a walking tour the older two continued their walk but the youngest seemed more interested in the girls than his brothers were and stayed to dance with several of them as he left the dance he noticed tess who seemed a little sad that he had not chosen her he looked back from the road and could still see her in her white dress standing modestly apart from the dancers he wished he had danced with her he wished he had asked her name but it was too late he hurried on to join his brothers the young stranger had made an impression on tess but soon worried by her father s strange appearance that afternoon she decided to walk home after the excitement of the dance her parents small cottage was a depressing sight it was dark inside as they had only one candle the furniture was old and worn there were six children crowded into the tiny space their mother was doing the washing at the same time as putting the baby to sleep looking after so many children had aged joan durbeyfield but she still showed some of her early prettiness which tess had inherited let me help with the washing mother said tess gently oh tess i m glad you ve come said her mother there s something i must tell you is it anything to do with father making such a fool of himself this afternoon asked tess frowning that s all part of the excitement they ve discovered we re the oldest family in the whole county going back a long way and our real name is d urberville doesn t that make you proud that s why your father rode home in the carriage not because he d been drinking as people thought i m glad of that will it do us any good mother oh yes great things may come of it no doubt our noble relations will be arriving in their carriages as soon as they find out where is father now asked tess suddenly her mother did not answer directly he saw the doctor today you know it s fat round the heart he says that s the cause of his illness he might last ten years might last ten months or days tess looked anxious her father suddenly a great man to die so soon but where is father she asked firmly now don t you get angry said mrs durbeyfield the poor man was feeling so weak after the news that he went to rolliver s he needs to build up his strength to deliver the beehives tomorrow remember oh my god cried tess he went to a public house and you agreed to it mother no i didn t said mrs durbeyfield crossly i ve been waiting for you to look after the children while i fetch him tess knew that her mother greatly looked forwad to these trips to rolliver s there she could sit by her husband s side among the beer drinkers and forget that the children existed it was one of the few bright moments in her hardworking life mrs durbeyfield went out and tess was left with the children they were very young and totally dependent on the durbeyfield couple six helpless creatures who had not asked to be born at all much less to be part of the irresponsible durbeyfield family it was eleven o clock before all the family were in bed and two o clock next morning was the latest time to set off with the beehives it was a distance of twenty or thirty miles on bad roads to casterbridge where the saturday market was held at half past one mrs durbeyfield came into the bedroom where tess and all the children slept the poor man can t go she whispered tess sat up in bed but it s late for the bees already we must take them today maybe a young man would go asked mrs durbeyfield doubtfully one of the ones dancing with you yesterday oh no not for the world said tess proudly and let everybody know the reason i d be so ashamed i think i could go if little abraham came with me tess and abraham dressed led out the old horse prince with the loaded waggon and set off in the dark they cheered themselves up with bread and butter and conversation tess said abraham after a silence yes abraham aren t you glad that we re a noble family not particularly but you re glad you re going to marry a gentleman what said tess lifting her face our noble relations are going to help you marry a gentleman me our noble relations we haven t any whatever put that into your head i heard them talking about it at home there s a rich lady of our family out at trantridge and mother said that if you claimed relationship with her she d help you marry a gentleman his sister became suddenly silent abraham talked on not noticing her lack of attention did you say the stars were worlds tess yes all like ours they seem like our apples most of them good a few bad which do we live on a good one or a bad one a bad one if we lived on a good one how would things be different well father wouldn t be ill and cough as he does and mother wouldn t always be washing and you would have been a ready made rich lady and not have to marry a gentleman oh aby don t don t talk of that any more abraham finally went to sleep on the waggon tess drove the horse gradually she fell into a dream she could see her father foolish in his pride and the rich gentleman of her mother s imagination laughing at the poor durbeyfield family suddenly she awoke from her dream to noise and violent movement something terrible had happened she jumped down and discovered that the post carriage speeding along the dark road had driven into her slow and unlighted waggon poor prince was seriously hurt and as she watched he fell to the ground you were on the wrong side said the post driver i must go on with the post but i ll send somebody to help you as soon as i can you d better stay here with your waggon he went on his way while tess stood and waited tears pouring down her cheeks daylight came prince lay there unmoving his eyes half open it s all my fault cried tess what will mother and father live on now aby aby wake up we can t go on with our beehives prince is dead when aby realized what had happened his face looked like an old man s it s because we live on a bad star isn t it tess he said through his tears finally a man arrived with a horse to take the waggon on to casterbridge to deliver the beehives and then collect prince on the way back when they got home tess broke the news to her parents they were not angry with her but she blamed herself completely when durbeyfield heard he would only get a few shillings for prince s dead body he rose to the occasion we d urbervilles don t sell our horses for cat s meat he insisted and the following day he worked harder than usual in digging a grave where prince was buried all the children cried has he gone to heaven asked abraham in tears but tess did not cry her face was dry and pale she felt she had murdered a friend life now became rather difficult for the durbeyfields without prince to carry loads john durbeyfield could not buy and sell as he used to he had never worked hard or regularly and now he only occasionally felt like working tess wondered how she could help her parents one day her mother made a suggestion it s lucky we ve found out about your noble blood tess do you know there s a very rich lady called mrs d urberville living on the other side of the wood she must be our relation you must go to her and claim relationship with her and ask for same help in our trouble i wouldn t like to do that said tess if there is such a lady it would be enough to be friendly we can t expect help from her you could persuade anybody my dear besides something else might happen you never know and her mother nodded wisely i d rather try to get work said tess sadly what do you say durbeyfield said his wife turning to him i don t like my children asking for help said he proudly i m the head of the oldest branch of the family and a noble family like ours shouldn t have to ask for help tess could not accept his reasons for not going well as i killed the horse mother i suppose i ought to go but don t start thinking about her finding a husband for me who said i had such an idea asked joan innocently i know you mother but i ll go next morning tess walked to shaston a town she hardly knew and went on by waggon to trantridge the vale of blackmoor was her only world and she had never been far outside the valley all the knowledge she had came from her lessons in the village school which she had left a year or two earlier as soon as she left school she had tried to earn a little money by helping in the fields or milking cows or making butter she blamed her mother for thoughtlessly producing so many children joan durbeyfield was like a child herself and never thought about the future it was tess who worried and worked and felt responsible for her little brothers and sisters so naturally it was tess who should represent her family at the d urberville home from trantridge she walked up a hill and turning a corner saw the house she stoppd in amazement it was large and almost new a rich red against the green of the bushes around it behind it lay the woods called the chase an ancient forest there were greenhouses and well kept gardens there was no lack of money here tess hesitated almost frightened i thought we were an old family she said to herself but this is all new she wished she had not come she was right in a way all this was owned by the d urbervilles or the stoke d urbervilles as they called themselves at first the stokes were a northern business family who took an old sounding name to add to their own when they moved into the south so tess was more of a d urberville than any of them but did not know it a young man appeared in the garden he looked about twenty four and was tall and dark with full red lips and a black moustache curled at the ends well my beauty what can i do for you he said looking interestedly at her i m mr d urberville it needed all tess s courage to reply i came to see your mother sir i m afraid you can t see her she s ill what do you want to see her about i i it seems so foolish never mind said he kindly i like foolish things try again my dear i came sir to tell you we are of the same family as you aha poor relations yes stokes no d urbervilles oh yes of course i mean d urbervilles we have several proofs that we are d urbervilles we have an old silver spoon and a seal at home but mother uses the spoon to stir the soup mother said we ought to tell you as we are the oldest branch of the family and we ve lost our horse in an accident very kind of your mother said alec d urberville and i certainly don t regret it he looked admiringly at tess whose face blushed a deep pink and so you ve come on a friendly visit i suppose i have murmured tess looking uncomfortable let us walk round the gardens until you have to go home my pretty cousin tess wanted to leave as soon as possible but the young man insisted he took her to the greenhouses do you like strawberries he asked yes said tess when they are ready these are ready now and so saying d urberville picked one and held it to her mouth no no she said i d rather take it myself but alec put it into her mouth he put roses into her hair and filled her basket with strawberries and flowers he gave her food to eat and watched her while he quietly smoked a cigarette she looked more adult and womanly than she really was alec could not take his eyes off her she did not know as she smiled innocently at the flowers that behind the cigarette smoke was the cause of future sorrow in her life what is your name asked alec tess durbeyfield we live at marlott i must see if my mother can find a place for you they said goodbye and she set off home carrying her strawberries and flowers this then was the beginning why did she have to meet the wrong man and one who was so strongly attracted to her yet to the right man she was only a half forgotten impression from an evening s dancing in a country field in life the right man to love hardly ever comes at the right time for loving nature does not often answer a call for love until the caller is tired of calling in this case as in millions it was not the two halves of a perfect whole who met a missing half wandered somewhere else arriving much later this delay was to have tragic results when tess arrived home the following afternoon a letter had already been received by her mother it appeared to come from mrs d urberville and offered tess work looking after chickens joan durbeyfield was delighted it s just a way of getting you there without raising your hopes she s going to recognize you as family i m sure of it i would rather stay here with father and you said tess looking out of the window but why i d rather not tell you mother i don t really know a few days later when tess came back from looking for work the children came running out and danced round her the gentleman s been here they shouted joan was full of smiles mrs d urberville s son had called and asked if tess could come or not he s a very handsome man said mrs durbeyfield i don t think so said tess coldly i ll think it over she left the room he s in love with her you can see that said mrs durbeyfield to her husband no doubt he ll marry her and she ll be a fine lady john durbeyfield had more pride in his new found blood than energy or health that s what young mr d urberville is trying to do improve his blood by marrying into the old line persuaded by her mother and the children tess finally agreed to go mrs durbeyfield secretly made wedding plans then the day came when tess wearing her best sunday clothes on her mother s orders said goodbye to her family goodbye my girl said sir john waking from a short sleep tell young d urberville i ll sell him the title yes sell it at a reasonable price not for less than a thousand pounds cried lady durbeyfield no tell him he can have it for a hundred no fifty no twenty yes twenty pounds that s the lowest family honour is family honour and i won t take any less tess felt like crying but turned quickly and went out her mother went with her to the edge of the village there she stopped and stood waving goodbye and watched her daughter walking away into the distance a waggon came to take her bags and then a fashionable little carriage appeared it was driven by a well dressed young man smoking a cigar after a moment s hesitation tess stepped in joan durbeyfield watching wondered for the first time if she had been right in encouraging tess to go that night she said to her husband perhaps i should have found out how the gentleman really feels about her yes perhaps you ought murmured john half asleep joan s natural trust in the future came back to her well if he doesn t marry her before he ll marry her after if she plays her cards right if he knows about her d urberville blood you mean no stupid if she shows him her pretty face meanwhile alec d urberville was whipping his horse and driving the carriage faster and faster downhill the trees rushed past at great speed tess was feeling thoroughly frightened he took no notice when she asked him to slow down she cried out and held on to his arm in fear don t touch my arm hold on to my waist he shouted at the top of another hill he said laughing put your arms around me again my beauty never said tess independently let me give you one little kiss tess and i ll stop will nothing else do cried tess in despair oh very well as they raced on he was on the point of kissing her when she suddenly moved aside so that he almost fell off i ll break both our necks he swore passionately i thought you would be kind to me said tess her eyes filling with tears i don t want to kiss anybody but he insisted so in the end she sat still and d urberville kissed her no sooner had he done so than she wiped the place on her cheek with her handkerchief just then her hat blew off into the road and d urberville stopped the horse tess jumped down to get it then turned triumphantly to alec i shall walk from here she said firmly but it s five or six miles more i don t care you made that hat blow off on purpose you did didn t you she was silent he swore angrily at her don t use such bad words cried tess i shall go back to mother i hate you d urberville suddenly started laughing look i promise never to do that again he said come let me take you in the carriage but she refused and began to walk in the direction of trantridge so they progressed slowly d urberville driving the carriage beside tess the chickens for which tess was responsible lived in an old cottage on mrs d urberville s land on her first day tess had to take some of the chickens to show to their owner she immediately realized the old lady was blind mrs d urberville held each bird and felt it carefully to see that it was in good health at the end she suddenly asked tess a question can you whistle whistle ma am yes whistle tunes i want you to practise and whistle to my birds every day yes ma am tess was not surprised at mrs d urberville s cold manner and did not expect any more of such a great lady however she did not realize that the old lady had never even heard about the family connection tess began to enjoy her new work with the chickens and the next day in the cottage garden she decided to practise whistling as instructed she was shocked to find that she had completely forgotten how to whistle suddenly she noticed a movement behind a tree near the wall it was alec d urberville well cousin tess he said i ve never seen such a beautiful thing as you i ve been watching you from over the wall look i can give you a lesson or two oh no you won t cried tess going back towards the door don t worry i won t touch you just look and he showed her how to whistle from that moment tess found she could whistle tunes to the birds just as mrs d urberville wanted and as the weeks passed she often met d urberville in the garden and began to lose her shyness of him every saturday night the other farm workers from the surrounding area used to go to drink and dance in the market town two or three miles away on sundays they would sleep late for a long time tess did not go with them but after a while she wanted a change from her routine and began to go on the weekly trips regularly she always came home with the others at night preferring the protection of being in a group one saturday night she was in the town looking for her companions as it was time to go home when she met alec d urberville what my beauty here so late he said smiling at her i m just waiting for my friends she answered i ll see you again he said as she moved away she became worried when she realized the workers were still dancing wildly and would not be going home soon again she caught sight of alec waiting in a doorway his cigar glowing red in the dark eventually she joined a group wandering home they had all been drinking but she felt safer with them than alone but after a while she became involved in a quarrel with them and was trying to get away from the angry group when alec d urberville rode by he offered to take her home on the back of his horse she hesitatedt then accepted together they rode along in the dark tess holding on to alec she was very tired every day that week she had got up at five so she did not notice that they were riding off the main road and into the chase the oldest wood in england it began to get foggy and finally alec admitted honestly that he was lost put me down here sir cried tess at once let me walk home from here how wrong of you to bring me away from the main road i knew i shouldn t trust you don t worry my beauty laughed alec i thought you would enjoy a longer ride on such a lovely night but i can t let you go the fog is so bad now that you couldn t possibly find your way i ll leave you here and go to find out where we are when i come back i ll tell you and you can come with me on horseback or go alone on foot just as you like she agreed to this shall i hold the horse she asked no he ll stay quiet answered alec by the way your father has a new horse today and the children have some new toys was it was it you who gave them oh how good of you murmured tess with a heavy heart i almost wish you hadn t tessy don t you love me just a little now i m grateful she admitted but i m afraid i don t and slowly she started to cry now don t cry my dear sit here and wait for me he made a bed for the tired girl among the dead leaves and covered her with his coat he set off into the fog to find out where he was and came back to find tess fast asleep he saw her in her white dress among the leaves a pale shining figure in the dark he bent down and touched her cheek with his everywhere there was darkness and silence the birds and animals slept safe in and under the trees but who was looking after tess who was protecting her innocence tess said d urberville and lay down beside her the girl was not strong enough to resist him why was tess s girlish purity lost why does the wrong man take the wrong woman why do the bad so often ruin the good why is beauty damaged by ugliness thousands of years of philosophy cannot give us the answers to these questions these things happen and have always happened perhaps in the past rolling home after a battle tess s ancestors the real d urbervilles had done the same even more cruelly to young country girls but we cannot accept that that is tess s fault and should happen to her as the people of her village say it was to be and from now on tess s life was to be completely different maiden no more it was a sunday morning in late october about four months after tess s arrival at trantridge and a few weeks after the night ride in the chase carrying a heavy basket and bundle tess was walking towards the hills which divided her from the vale her place of birth the scenery and people on this side were very different from those in her village marlott people mainly thought and travelled northward and westward while on this side people were interested in the east and the south she walked up the same hill which d urberville had driven down so wildly that june day on reaching the top of the hill tess paused and looked for a long time at the familiar green world of home it was always beautiful from here but since she had last seen it her view of life had changed she had learnt that wickedness exists even where there is beauty and now she could hardly bear to look down into the vale then she looked behind her and saw a carriage coming up the same hill that she had just climbed with a man leading the horse soon he caught up with her why did you slip away in secret like that asked d urberville breathlessly i ve been driving like mad to catch up with you just look at my horse you know nobody would have prevented you from going i m going to drive you the rest of the way if you won t come back with me i won t come back she said quietly i thought so well let me help you up give me your basket she stepped up into the carriage and sat beside him she had no fear of him now the reason for this was also the reason for her sorrow they drove along d urberville making conversation and tess thinking her own thoughts when they approached the village of marlott a tear rolled down her cheek why are you crying he asked coldly i was only thinking i was born over there well we must all be born somewhere i wish i had never been born there or anywhere else she said quietly well you shouldn t have come to trantridge if you didn t want to you didn t come for love of me anyway that s quite true if i had ever loved you if i loved you still i could not hate myself for my weakness as much as i do now he did not look at her she added i didn t understand your intention until it was too late that s what every woman says how dare you say that she cried angrily her eyes flashing at him my god i could hit you did you never think that some women may not only say it but feel it all right he said laughing i am sorry to hurt you i did wrong i admit it only don t keep accusing me i am ready to pay for it you need never work on the farms again her lip lifted slightly as she replied i will not take anything from you i cannot one would think you were a queen as well as being one of the real d urbervilles well tess dear i suppose i m a bad sort of man i ve always been one and i always will be one but i promise i won t be bad to you again and if anything should happen you understand if you are in any trouble or need anything just drop me a line and i ll send by return whatever you want she stepped down from the carriage and was going to leave him when he stopped her and said you re not going to turn away from me like that dear gome let me kiss you if you wish she answered coldly she offered her cool cheek to him but her eyes rested on a distant tree as if the kiss had nothing to do with her you don t give me your lips tess i m afraid you ll never love me it s true i have never loved you and i never can she added sadly perhaps i should tell a lie and then i could lead a comfortable life but i have enough honour not to tell that lie if i loved you i might have a very good reason to tell you so but i don t alec sighed heavily as if this scene were depressing him well you re very sad tess and you have no reason to be you re still the prettiest girl for miles around will you come back with me say you will never never i ve made up my mind and i won t come then goodbye and alec jumped up into his carriage and drove off tess did not watch him go but continued her walk alone it was still early in the day and the sun was not yet giving any warmth tess felt even sadder than the autumn sadness which surrounded her but soon a man came up behind her a man with a pot of red paint in his hand good morning he said and offered to carry her basket you re up early on a sunday he continued yes said tess a day of rest for most people although i do more real work today than in the rest of the week put together do you in the week i work for man but on sunday i work for god that s better work don t you think wait a moment i have something to do here he stopped at a gate and in large red letters on the middle bar of the gate he painted some words from the bible punishment awaits you in the soft air against the gentle green of the trees and the peaceful fields these great red words stared at tess they pointed a finger at her this man was a stranger and could not know her story but the words accused her do you believe what you paint she asked in a low voice do i believe those words do i believe i am alive but she whispered trembling suppose you were forced to do wrong he shook his head i can t answer that question i paint the words and leave others to think about them in their own hearts i think they are horrible words cried tess i ll take my basket and go on now and she walked away from him her heart beating fast i don t believe god said those things she thought as she reached her village there was smoke coming from her father s chimney but seeing the inside of the cottage made her heart ache it was as poor as ever her mother jumped up surprised to see her well my dear tess she said kissing her how are you have you come home to be married no not for that mother what isn t your cousin going to marry you he s not my cousin and he s not going to marry me her mother looked at her closely come you haven t told me everything then tess went up to her mother put her head on joan s shoulder and told her the whole story and you haven t persuaded him to marry you cried joan what s the good of going there why didn t you think of doing some good for your family instead of thinking only of yourself tess was confused alec had never mentioned marriage to her but even if he had she would never have accepted him because she did not love him this made her hate herself for what she had done she would certainly never love him in the future she did not quite hate him but did not wish to marry him even to remain respectable you ought to have been more careful if you didn t want to marry him oh mother cried the poor girl her heart breaking why didn t you warn me about men i was a child when i left home i didn t know how dangerous they can be and you didn t tell me well we must make the best of it said her mother it s only human nature after all that afternoon the little cottage was full of tess s friends girls who lived in the village and who had missed her while she had been away they whispered to each other that tess was sure to marry that handsome gentleman fortunately tess did not hear them she joined in their laughing and talking and for a short time almost forgot her shame but the next day was monday the beginning of the working week when there were no best clothes and no visitors she awoke with the innocent children asleep around her she who had lost her innocence she looked into her future and grew very depressed she knew she had to travel on a long stony road without help or sympathy she had nothing to look forward to and she wanted to die in the next few weeks however she became more cheerful and went to church one sunday morning she loved listening to the well known tunes and gave herself up to the beauty of the music she wondered at the composer s power from the grave he could make a girl like her who had never known him feel extremes of emotion she sat in a quiet dark corner listening to the service but when the village people arrived at church they noticed her and started whispering to each other she knew what they were saying and realized she could come to church no more so she spent almost all her time in her bedroom which she shared with the children from here she watched the wind the snow the rain beautiful sunsets and full moons one after another people began to think she had gone away she only went out after dark to walk in the woods and the fields she was not afraid of the dark or the shadows it was people she was anxious to avoid she was at home on the lonely hills but she felt guilty surrounded by innocent nature when it rained she thought nature was crying at her weakness and when the midnight wind blew she thought nature was angry with her but she did not realize that although she had broken an accepted social rule she had done nothing against nature she was as innocent as the sleeping birds in the trees or the small field animals in the hedges one day in august the sun was rising through the mist in a yellow cornfield near marlott village it shone on two large arms of painted wood these with two others below formed the turning cross of the reaping machine it was ready for today s harvest a group of men and a group of women came down the road at sunrise as they walked along their heads were in the sun while their feet were in the shadow of the hedge they went into the field soon there came a sound like the love making of the grasshopper the machine had begun and three horses pulled it slowly along the field its arms turned bright in the sunlight gradually the area of standing corn was reduced so was the living space of the small field animals who crowded together not knowing that they could not escape the machine in the end the harvesters followed the machine picking and tying up bundles of corn the girls were perhaps more interesting to look at they wore large cotton hats to keep off the sun and gloves to protect their hands from the corn the prettiest was the one in the pale pink jacket who never looked around her as she worked she moved forward bending and tying like a machine occasionally she stood up to rest then her face could be seen a lovely young face with deep dark eyes and long heavy curling hair her cheeks were paler her teeth more regular and her red lips thinner than most country girls it was tess durbeyfield or d urberville rather changed living as a stranger in her home village she had decided to do outdoor work and earn a little money in the harvest the work continued all morning and tess began to glance towards the hill at eleven o clock a group of children came over the hill tess blushed a little but still did not pause in her work the eldest child carried in her arms a baby in long clothes another brought some lunch the harvesters stopped work sat down and started to eat and drink tess also sat down some way from the others she called the girl her sister and took the baby from her unfastening her dress and still blushing she began feeding her child the men kindly turned away some of them beginning to smoke all the other women started to talk and rearrange their hair when the baby had finished tess played with him without showing much enthusiasm then suddenly she kissed him again and again as if she could not stop the baby cried out at the violence of her kisses she loves that child though she says she hates him and wishes they were both dead said one of the women watching the young mother she ll soon stop saying that replied another she ll get used to it it happens to lots of girls well it wasn t her fault she was forced into it that night in the chase people heard her sobbing a certain gentleman might have been punished if somebody had passed by and seen them it was a pity it happened to her the prettiest in the village but that s how it happens the ugly ones are as safe as houses aren t they jenny and the speaker turned to one who was certainly not beautiful tess sat there unaware of their conversation her mouth was like a flower and her eyes were large and soft sometimes black blue or grey sometimes all three colours together she had spent months regretting her experience and crying over it but suddenly decided that the past was the past in a few years her shame and she herself would be forgotten meanwhile the trees were just as green and the sun shone just as brightly as before life went on she most feared what people thought of her and imagined that they talked constantly about her behind her back in fact she was not often discussed and even her friends only thought about her occasionally other things of more importance took up their time if there had been no people around her tess would not have made herself so unhappy she would have accepted the situation as it was she was miserable not because she felt unhappy but because she imagined herself rejected by society now she wanted to be useful again and to work so she dressed neatly and helped in the harvest and looked people calmly in the face even when holding her baby in her arms having eaten her lunch quickly tess went back to work with the harvesters in the cornfield until it was dark they all came home on one of the largest waggons singing and laughing together but when tess reached home she discovered that the baby had fallen ill that afternoon he was so small and weak that illness was to be expected but this still came as a shock to tess she forgot the shame surrounding his birth and only wished passionately to keep him alive however it became clear that he was dying now tess had a greater problem her baby had not been baptized her ideas on religion were not very developed she had more or less accepted that she would go to hell for her crime and did not much care what would happen to her after death but fo her baby it was different he was dying and must be saved from hell it was nearly bedtime but she rushed downstairs and asked if she could send for the parson her father had just returned from the public house and was at his most sensitive to the shame brought upon his noble name by tess he refused to allow the parson in and locked the door the family went to sleep as the night passed tess realized in great misery that the baby was close to death she walked feverishly up and down the room until an idea came to her ah perhaps baby can be saved perhaps it will be just the same she lit a candle and woke her young brothers and sisters having poured some water into a bowl she made them kneel around with their hands together as in church the children were hardly awake and watched tess with big round eyes she looked tall in her long white nightdress her long dark hair hanging down her back to her waist her enthusiasm lit up her face giving it a beautiful purity the face which had caused her shame she picked up the baby one of the children asked are you really going to baptize him tess what s his name going to be she had not thought of that but remembered the story of adam and eve in the bible because they did wrong together god said they would live in sorrow for the rest of their lives she said firmly sorrow i baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost she splashed some water on the child and there was silence say amen children amen they replied tess put her hand into the water and drew a huge cross upon the baby with her finger she continued the service in the well known words asking for the baby to be protected against the world and against wickedness her belief gave her hope her sweet warm voice rang out the thanks that follow the baptism the single candle was reflected in her shining eyes like a diamond the children asked no more questions but looked up at her in amazement she seemed almost like a god to them poor sorrow s fight against the world and wickedness was a short one fortunately perhaps taking into account his situation in the blue light of the morning he breathed his last tess had been calm since the baptism and she remained calm she was no longer worried about sorrow s afterlife if god did not accept the baptism she did not value his heaven either for herself or for her child tess thought a good deal about the baptism however and wondered if it might mean that sorrow could be buried in the churchyard with a church service she went to the parson s house after dark and met him near his gate i should like to ask you something sir my baby was very ill and i wanted you to baptize him but my father refused to allow it so i baptized him myself now sir can you tell me this and she looked him straight in the eyes will it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him the parson wanted to say no she had done what should have been his job but the girl s strong feeling impressed him the man and the parson fought inside him and the man won my dear girl he said it will be just the same then will you bury him in the churchyard she asked quickly the parson felt trapped it was a difficult question to answer ah that s a different matter he said m sorry i cannot oh sir she took his hand as she spoke he took it away shaking his head then i ll never come to church again she cried but perhaps it will be the same for him tell me have pity on me poor me tell me what you really think the parson was deeply touched by her emotion for a surprising moment he forgot the strict rules of his church it will be just the same he answered kindly so the baby was carried in a cheap wooden box to the churchyard at nignt there is a corner of the churchyard where the grass grows long and where the suicides drunks unbaptized babies and other supposed criminals are laid sorrow was buried here at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer for the gravedigger tess bravely made a little cross and put it at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen it is all very well saying that we learn from experience tess had certainly learnt from experience but could not see how to use her knowledge so painfully gained so she stayed in her parents home during the winter helping to look after the children making clothes for them and earning a little money whenever she could important dates came round again the night of her shame in the chase the baby s birth and death her own birthday one day when she was looking at her pretty face in the mirror she thought of another date even more important her own death when it came it would swallow up all her prettiness and everything that had happened to her when was it it was a day lying hidden among all the other days of the year so that she noticed nothing when it came round and did not know what week month season or year it would be in a flash tess changed from simple girl to complicated woman her face was often thoughtful and there was sometimes a tragic note in her voice her eyes grew larger and more expressive she became a beautiful woman she had suffered but had gained a certain self confidence from her experiences although the village people had almost forgotten her trouble she decided she could never be really happy in marlott trying to claim relationship with the rich d urbervilles seemed so foolish and shameful to her she thought her family would never be respected there again even now she felt hope rise within her hope of finding a place with no family connections and no memories in escaping from marlott she intended to destroy the past perhaps now she could make up for her crime against society consequently she looked hard for work away from marlott she finally heard that a dairyman some miles to the south needed a good milkmaid for the summer having decided to go there she promised herself there would be no more hopeless dreams she would simply be the dairymaid tess and nothing more even her mother no longer talked about their connection with the noble d urbervilles but in spite of tess s decision to forget her ancestors the dairy called talbothays especially attracted her because it was near the former lands of the old d urberville family she would be able to look at them and not only observe that the noble d urberville family had lost its greatness but also remember that a poor descendant had lost her innocence she wondered if some good might come of being in the land of her ancestors hope and youthful energy rose up in her again like leaves on a young tree in spring a new life and so it was that on a beautiful morning in may two to three years after her return from trantridge tess durbeyfield left home for the second time she was going in the opposite direction this time when she reached the first hill she looked back at marlott and her father s house with sadness in her heart she travelled partly by carriage and partly on foot carrying her basket not far to her left she could see the trees which surrounded kingsbere with its church where her ancestors lay in their tombs she could no longer admire or respect them she almost hated them for ruining her life nothing of theirs was left except the old seal and spoon huh i have as much of mother as father in me she said all my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid her walk took two hours until she reached the hill overlooking the valley of the great dairies this valley was watered by the river froom and produced huge amounts of milk and butter more even than tess s vale of blackmoor which was known as the vale of little dairies as she stood and looked she realized the valleys were quite different here the fields and farms were much larger she saw more cows at a glance than she had ever seen before the evening sun shone on their red white and brown bodies she thought that this view was perhaps not as beautiful as a view of blackmoor vale which she knew so well there the sky was deep blue the smell of the earth was heavy in the air the streams ran slowly and silently but this view was more cheerful here the air was clear and light and the river froom rushed as fast as the shadow of a cloud either the change in the quality of the air or the feeling that she was going to start a new life here made her feel much happier she ran along her hopes and the sunshine warming her she looked at her best as she ran laughing into the warm wind the desire for pleasure which is in every living thing had finally won over tess she was after all only a young woman of twenty who had not finished growing up no event however unpleasant could have marked her for ever she was young and strong and beautiful and could not remain sad for long her hopes rose higher than ever she wanted to show how grateful she was for this second chance she started singing love songs but found they were not enough to express her feelings she remembered the sunday mornings of her girlhood and sang oh sun and moon oh stars oh children of men praise the lord praise him for ever until she stopped suddenly and murmured but perhaps i don t quite know the lord yet this was probably a pagan feeling in a religious form people who live in the country and are close to nature like tess keep many of the pagan ideas of their ancestors in their souls religion learned in church comes much later and does not touch them deeply tess was happy to be making her way independently in life she really wanted to live honestly and work hard unlike her father tess had her mother s energy and the energy of her youth to help her recover from her experience women do usually live through such experiences where there s life there s hope is still true for most betrayed women as tess full of enthusiasm came downhill towards the dairy she suddenly heard the milking call again and again from all parts of the valley it was half past four when the dairy people brought in the cows tess followed the red and white animals with their great bags of milk under them into the farmyard she saw the long sheds and the wooden posts shining and smooth where the cows had rubbed against them over the years she saw the cows between the posts the sun throwing their shadows on the wall as carefully as a painter paints a beautiful king or queen as the cows waited for their turn the milk fell in drops on the ground the dairymaids and men had come from their cottages as they saw the cows arriving from the fields each girl sat on her three legged stool as she milked her right cheek resting on the cow s body watching tess arrive the men milked with their hats low over their eyes and did not see her one of them was a middle aged man the head dairyman she was looking for he worked six days a week in his white milking clothes milking and butter making and on the seventh he wore his best suit to take his family proudly to church because of this people nearby used to say dairyman dick all the week on sundays mister richard crick most dairymen are usually bad tempered at milking time but mr crick was glad to get a new dairymaid at this busy time of the year so he received tess warmly and asked her how her family were when i was a boy i knew your part of the country very well be said an old woman of ninety she s dead now but she used to live near here she once told me there was an ancient noble family of a name like yours who came from here originally but i didn t take any notice of an old woman like that oh no that s just a story said tess then mr crick turned to business you can milk well my girl i don t want my cows drying up especially just now oh yes i can answered tess he looked at her delicate hands and pale face quite sure you re strong enough for this sort of life it s comfortable enough here for rough country people but it s hard work oh yes i m strong enough i m used to hard work tess insisted well have some tea and something to eat you ve had a long journey he said kindly no i d rather begin milking straight away said tess i ll just drink a little milk first this surprised dairyman crick who appeared never to have thought of milk as a drink oh if you can swallow it have some he said holding the bucket for her to drink from i haven t touched any for years it would lie in my stomach like a stone so it would now try that one and see how you get on and he pointed to the nearest cow as soon as tess was on her stool under the cow and the milk was pouring between her fingers into the bucket she really felt that her new life was beginning as she relaxed she looked around her it was a large dairy there were nearly a hundred milking cows dairyman crick milked six or eight of the difficult ones with his own hands he could not trust them to the dairymaids because if the cows were badly milked their milk would simply dry up for a while there was no more talk among the milkers suddenly mr crick got up from his stool we re not getting as much milk from them as usual he said we d better sing them a song friends that s the only thing to do so the group of milkers started singing to encourage the cows to give more mr crick went on but i think bulls like music better than cows did i tell you all about william dewy on his way home after a wedding he found himself in a field with an angry bull he took his violin and played some christmas church music and down went the bull on his knees just like the animals around baby jesus and so william was able to escape it s a curious story it takes us back to the past when belief in god was a living thing this unusual remark came from under a cow well it s quite true sir believe it or not i knew the man well said mr crick oh yes i m sure it s true said the man behind the brown cow tess could not see his face and could not understand why the head dairyman himself should call him sir the man stayed under the cow long enough to milk three at times saying something angrily to himself then he stood up stretching his arms tess could now see him clearly he wore the clothes of a dairyman but underneath he was quite different he looked educated and gentlemanly but now she realized that she had seen him before he was one of the three walking brothers who had stopped their walk to admire the may day dance in marlott a few years before he had danced with some of the other girls but not with her he had not noticed her and had gone on his way for a moment she was worried that if he recognized her he might discover her story but she soon saw he did not remember her at all since she had seen him in marlott his face had grown more thoughtful he now had a young man s moustache and beard from the time he had spent milking one cow he was clearly a beginner at dairy work tess discovered that only two or three of the dairymaids slept in the house besides herself they all shared a big bedroom near the cheese room that night one of the girls insisted on telling tess about all the people at the dairy to tess half asleep the whispers seemed to be floating in the air mr angel clare he s the one who s learning milkinghe s a parson s son and thinks a lot and doesn t notice girls his father is parson at emminster some way from here his sons except mr clare are going to be parsons too tess gradually fell asleep neither angel clare nor his family had originally chosen farming as a profession for him when he was a boy people admired his great qualities now he was a man something vague and undecided in his look showed that he had no particular purpose in life he was the youngest son of a poor parson one day when he was studying at home his father discovered that angel had ordered a book of philosophy which questioned the church s teaching how could his son become a priest if he read such books angel explained that he did not in fact wish to enter the church like his brothers because the church s views were too strict and did not allow free thinking the simple parson was shocked he was a man of fixed ideas and a firm believer and if angel did not want to become a priest what was the use of sending him to study at cambridge for the parson the whole point of going to university was to become a minister of god i want to use my mind angel insisted i want to read philosophy i want to question my belief so that what is left after i have questioned it will be even stronger but angel your mother and i have saved and saved to send you to university like your brothers but how can we send you there if it is not in the service of god so angel did not have the advantage of a university education after some years studying at home he decided to learn farming he thought this kind of work could give him what he most valued independence and freedom to think so he came to talbothays at twenty six as a student at first he stayed up in his room most of the time in the evenings reading and playing his harp but he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals in the general dining room with the dairy people the longer he stayed the more clare liked living with these simple country people no longer did he see them as lacking in intelligence he realized they were no different from him he and they were all people walking on the dusty road which ends in death he began to like working outside he was learning about nature and about life he came to know the changing seasons morning and evening different winds waters and mists shade and silence and the voices of nature all this he had never known before for several days after tess s arrival clare sitting reading a book hardly noticed she was there but one morning at breakfast he was reading music and listening to the tune in his head when he heard a musical voice which seemed to become part of his tune he looked round at tess seated at the table what a fresh and pure daughter of nature that dairymaid is thought angel he seemed to remember something about her something which took him back into a happy past before decision made his life difficult this memory made him look more often at tess than the other dairymaids dairyman crick insisted that all the dairy people should milk different cows every day not just their favourites he was worried that a dairymaid might leave the dairy and then her cows would not like being milked by a stranger however tess began to find that the cows which came to her usually happened to be her favourites this made her milking much easier but she soon realized that it was not by chance as it was angel clare who sent the cows in for milking mr clare you have sent me my favourite cows she accused him one morning blushing well it doesn t matter said he you will always be here to milk them do you think so i hope i shall but i don t know afterwards she was angry with herself she had spoken too seriously to him as if he were involved in her staying or leaving in the evening after milking she walked in the garden alone thinking about it it was a typical summer evening in june the air was delicate and there was a complete absolute silence it was broken by the sound of a harp the notes floated in the still air strong and clear tess listened like a fascinated bird she drew near to clare who still had not seen her she was conscious of neither time nor space the tune moved through her mind and body bringing tears to her eyes the waves of colour of the wild flowers mixed with the waves of sound angel finished playing and caught sight of her she blushed and moved away why are you going tess he asked are you afraid oh no sir not of outdoor things but indoors well yes sir life in general yes sir ah so am i very often being alive is rather serious don t you think so it is now you put it like that all the same i wouldn t expect a young girl like you to feel that why come tell me after a moment s hesitation she answered the trees ask questions with their eyes don t they and you seem to see hundreds of tomorrows all in a line the first big and clear the others getting smaller but they all look fierce and cruel but you can drive away all these ideas with your music sir he was surprised to find that this dairymaid had such sad thoughts she was expressing in her own words the ache of modern life this sadness made her more interesting to him he did not know that her experience had given her great strength of feeling tess on the other hand could not understand why a man of religious family good education and financial independence should feel sorry to be alive how could this admirable and poetic man have felt as she did two or three years ago that he would rather die it was true that he was not at present living among gentlemen but he was studying what he wanted to know and would become a rich farmer in time so as they neither understood each other s secrets they were both puzzled and waited to find out more at first tess regarded angel as an intelligence rather than a man she became quite depressed as she realized the distance between her own knowledge and his one day he asked her why she looked so sad oh it s only that i feel i ve been wasting my life when i see what you know i feel what a nothing i am well my dear tess said angel with some enthusiasm i shall be only too glad to help you study history for example i don t know what s the use of learning that i m one of a long row and that my past and future are like thousands of other people s but there s one thing i d like to know why the sun shines on the good and the bad just the same she said her voice trembling oh tess don t be bitter of course he had wondered this himself in the past but as he looked at her innocent lips he thought this pure child of nature could only have picked up the question from others she could not possibly have any guilt in her past when he had gone tess felt again how stupid she must appear to him she wondered whether she could gain his respect by telling him of her d urberville blood she first asked the dairyman if mr clare was interested in old families who had lost their money and land no said mr crick firmly he s a rebel and the one thing he hates is an old family after hearing this not very accurate view of clare s opinions poor tess was glad she had not mentioned her ancestors that summer tess and clare unconsciously studied each other balanced on the edge of a passion yet just keeping out of it but all the time like two streams in a valley they were destined to join tess had never been so happy as she was now and perhaps never would be so again they met continually they could not help it they met daily in the half light at three o clock in the morning just before milking they felt they were the first two up in the whole world like adam and eve tess seemed like a queen to clare perhaps because he knew that she was the most beautiful woman walking about at this time of day lovely women are usually asleep at midsummer sunrise but tess was near and the rest were nowhere in the strange light she was no longer a milkmaid but a vision of woman the whole of womanhood in one form one day just after breakfast they all gathered in the milkhouse the milk was turning in the churn but the butter would not come dairyman crick was worried maybe someone in the house is in love suggestea his wife that sometimes causes it d you remember that maid years ago and the butter didn t come ah yes but that wasn t being in love replied mr crick that was damage to the churn he turned to clare to tell the story jack dollop one of our milkers got a girl into trouble one day her mother came looking for him with a great heavy umbrella in her hand jack hid in the churn but she found him and turned it round and round stop stop cried jack if you promise to marry my daughter shouted the mother and so he did tess very pale had gone to the door for some fresh air fortunately the butter suddenly came but tess remained depressed all afternoon to the others the story was funny she alone could see the sorrow in it and it reminded her of her experience tess was first in bed that night and was half asleep as the other girls undressed she saw them standing at the window looking at someone in the garden with great interest it s no use you being in love with him any more than me retty priddle said marian the eldest there he is again cried lzz huett a pale girl with dark hair i would just marry him tomorrow if he asked me said marian blushing so would i and more murmured izz and i too whispered retty shyly we can t all marry him said izz we can t anyway said marian he likes tess durbeyfield best i ve watched him every day and found it out there was a thoughtful silence how silly this all is said izz impatiently he s a gentleman s son he won t marry any of us or tess either they all sighed and crept into their beds and fell asleep but tess with her deeper feelings could not sleep she knew angel clare preferred her to the others she was more attractive better educated and more womanly she could keep his affection for her but should she perhaps the others should have a chance of attracting his attention and even of marrying him she had heard from mrs crick that mr clare had spoken of marrying a country girl to help him farm milk cows and reap corn tess had promised herself she would never marry and would never be tempted to do so she ought to leave the field open for the other girls next morning dairyman crick sent all the dairy people out into a field to search for garlic plants one bite by one cow was enough to make the whole day s butter taste of garlic it was not by accident that clare walked next to tess don t they look pretty she said to him who izzy huett and retty she had decided that either would make a good farmer s wife pretty well yes i have often thought so they are excellent dairywomen yes though not better than you clare observed them she is blushing continued tess bravely because you are looking at her she could hardly say marry one of them if you really don t want a fine lady don t think of marrying me from now on she tried to avoid spending time with angel she gave the other three every chance it was july and very hot the atmosphere of the flat valley hung like a drug over the dairy people the cows and the trees it was sunday morning after milking tess and the other three girls dressed quickly to go to mellstock church which was three or four miles away from talbothays heavy thunderstorms had poured down the day before but today the sun shone brightly and the air was warm and clear when the girls reached the lowest part of the road to mellstock they found it was flooded in working clothes and boots they would have walked through but they were wearing sunday white stockings and thin shoes which they did not want to ruin the church bell was calling still a mile away suddenly they saw angel clare approaching he had seen them from far away and had come to help them one of them in particular i ll carry you through the water all of you he offered all four blushed as if they had one heart now marian put your arms round my shoulders hold on and angel walked off with her in his arms next was lzz huett her lips were dry with emotion angel returned for retty while he was picking her up he glanced at tess he could not have said more plainly it will soon be you and i there was an understanding between them it was now tess s turn he picked her up she was embarrassed to discover her excitement at his nearness three plain girls to get one beauty he whispered they are better women than i she said bravely not to me said angel she blushed there was silence clare stood still and bent his face to hers oh tessy he said her cheeks were pink and she could not look into his eyes but he respected her modesty and did nothing more he walked slowly however to make the journey as long as possible and put her down on dry land her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at them he said goodbye and went back by the road the four walked on together marian broke the silence by saying no we have no chance against her she looked joylessly at tess what do you mean asked tess he likes you best the very best we saw as he brought you over he d have kissed you if you had encouraged him only a little they were no longer cheerful but they were not bitter they were generous country girls who accept that such things happen tess s heart ached she knew that she loved angel clare perhaps all the more passionately because the others also loved him and yet that same hungry heart of hers pitied her friends i will never stand in your way she cried to them that evening in the bedroom i don t think he s thinking of marrying but even if he asked me i d refuse him as i d refuse any man oh why they asked i cannot marry but i don t think he will choose any of you so the girls remained friends they all shared each other s secret the air in their bedroom was full of their hopeless passion there was a flame burning the inside of their hearts out but because they had no hope they were not jealous of each other they had even heard that angel s family were planning for him to marry a neighbour s daughter tess no longer attached any importance to clare s interest in her it was a passing summer attraction nothing more the heat grew steadily greater in this stormy atmosphere even a passing attraction would deepen into love everything in nature was ready for love clare became gradually more passionately in love with the soft and silent tess the fields were dry waggons threw up clouds of dust on the road cows jumped over gates chased by flies dairyman crick s sleeves were rolled up from monday to saturday and the milkers milked in the fields for coolness on one of these afternoons tess and angel were milking near each other tess used to rest her head on the cow s body her eyes fixed on a distant field the sun shone on the beautiful lines of the face she did not know that clare had followed her round and sat watching her how very lovable her face was to him he had never seen such beautiful lips and teeth like roses filled with snow suddenly clare jumped up leaving his bucket to be kicked over by the cow went quickly towards her and kneeling down beside her took her in his arms tess let herself relax in his arms in a moment of joyful surprise he was on the point of kissing that tempting mouth but stopped himself forgive me tess dear he whispered i ought to have asked i love you tess really tess tried to free herself and her eyes began to fill with tears why are you crying my darling he asked oh i don t know she murmured trying to pull away well i ve shown my feeling at last tess he said with a curious sigh showing that his heart had overcome his reason i do love you dearly and truly but i shall go no further now i have surprised you she freed herself and they went on milking nobody had noticed and when dairyman crick came round there was no sign to show that there was any connection between them yet something had happened which was to change their whole world as a practical man the dairyman might laugh at love but love has a habit of changing people s lives it is a force to be respected the result the nights were as hot as the days angel clare could not sleep he went out into the darkness to think over what had happened that afternoon he had come as a student of farming to this dairy thinking he would be here only a short time he thought it would be a quiet place from here he could observe the great world outside before plunging back into it but the world outside had lost its interest and the quiet place was now the centre of all feeling clare was a thoughtful honest man he knew tess was not a toy to play with and throw away when finished with her life was as important to her as his was to him he knew he must treat her affection for him seriously but if they went on meeting every day their relationship must develop he could not stop himself as he had not decided what purpose their relationship should have he decided that for the moment they should meet as little as possible but it was not easy to keep to this decision he was driven towards her by the heat in his blood he thought he would go and see his family in less than five months he would have finished his studies here after a few more months on other farms he would be ready to start farming himself shouldn t a farmer s wife be a woman who understood farming he rode along the narrow road towards emminster and his parents house his eyes were looking not at the road but at next year he loved her ought he to marry her what would his mother and brothers say what would he himself say two years after the wedding as he rode into the village he saw a group of young girls waiting outside the church walking quickly to join them was miss mercy chant only daughter of his father s neighbour his parents quietly hoped angel would marry mercy one day she was very good at giving bible classes but in angel s mind was the face of the pretty milkmaid who hardly ever thought of god his family were delighted though surprised to see him angel was glad to be at home and yet he did not feel so much part of the family as he used to his father s religious belief was very strict but he was a kind honest man and fond of his sons however he would have been shocked to know of the pagan pleasure in nature and pretty womanhood experienced by angel his mother shared his father s religious views and helped in his church work his brothers seemed rather unimaginative and narrow minded although they were both well educated they felt that anybody outside the church or university could not be respected as he walked with his brothers angel felt that however lucky they were to have a university education neither of them really saw life as it was lived they thought farming was a poor man s job not suitable for a gentleman angel felt all the more determined to keep to his choice in the evening he spoke to his father alone after prayers mr clare told his son he had been saving the money he would have spent on his university education for him this encouraged angel to ask his father what sort of wife a farmer needed a really christian woman nothing else matters for example my neighbour dr chant but isn t the main thing that she should be able to milk cows churn good butter value animals and direct farm workers mr clare had clearly never thought of this before yes yes certainly but i was going to say that you will never find a purer woman than mercy chant your mother and i would be very happy if you yes yes mercy is good i know but father don t you think that one who is just as good and pure and who understands farm life as well as the farmer would be much better after much discussion angel got down to details he explained he had met a woman who was ideally suited to be a farmer s wife who went to church reqularly who was honest sensitive intelligent graceful pure as snow and extremely beautiful is she of a good family like mercy asked his surprised mother who had come in during the conversation she is not what we call a lady said angel firmly she is a cottager s daughter what s the advantage of good family to me my wife will have to work hard and manage with very little money mercy is educated that has its charm said his mother looking at him through her silver glasses i shall help her with her reading she will learn fast she s full of poetry real poetry she lives what poets only write and she is a good christian girl i m sure you ll value her for that his parents already doubted angel s religious belief so they were almost relieved to hear this of his future wife they told him not to act in a hurry but they would like to see her although angel was free to marry or not as he wished he did not want to hurt his parents and he accepted their advice as he set off to return to the dairy and tess his father rode with him a little way mr clare was telling his son about the new d urberville family who had taken the ancient name and lived near trantridge there was a young man and his blind mother preaching in the church there one day mr clare had spoken out bravely against the well known wickedness of young d urberville who after this had publicly insulted him when they met later angel was angry with d urberville dear father you should not let yourself be insulted like that it doesn t matter to me i have a duty to point out where people go wrong often men have hit me but then at least they haven t hit their families and they live to thank me and praise god i hope this young man does the same said angel warmly but it doesn t seem likely we ll hope anyway said mr clare maybe one of my words may grow like a seed in his heart one day angel could not accept his father s narrow religious beliefs but he loved him for his courage he remembered that his father had not once asked whether tess had money or not this lack of interest in money meant that all the brothers would probably be poor for ever but angel still admired his father s belief that money was not important when he returned to the dairy in the sleepy afternoon heat nobody was awake getting up so early in the morning meant the milkers really needed a sleep before the afternoon milking it was three o clock time for skimming there was a slight noise upstairs then tess appeared before his eyes she did not see him and stretched one arm up above her head she yawned like a cat and he saw the red inside of her mouth her whole soul breathed out physical beauty then her eyes flashed as she recognized him oh mr clar how you frightened me i she said looking glad shy and surprised at the same time clare stepped forward to put his arms round her dear darling tessy he whispered putting his face to her warm cheek don t call me mr clare any more i ve hurried back because of you they stood holding each other the sun warming them through the window he looked deep into her eyes of blue and black and grey she looked at him as eve must have looked at adam i must go skimming she said together they went to the milk house perhaps the talbothays milk was not very well skimmed that afternoon tess was in a dream as she skimmed the heat of his love made her feel like a plant under a burning sun theres s something very practical that i want to ask you he said gently i shall sonn want to marry being a farmer i need a wife who knows all about farms will you be that woman tessy she looked quite worried she had accepted that she could not help loving him but she had not expected this result with bitter pain she replied as she had promised herself she would oh mr clare i cannot be your wife i cannot be the sound of these words seemed to break her very heart but tess he said amazed at her answer and holding her still closer surely you love me oh yes yes and i would rather be yours than anybody s in the whole world but i cannot marry you cried the sweet and honest voice miserably tess have you agreed to marry someone else no no then why do you refuse me your father is a parson and your mother will want you to marry a lady said poor tess desperately trying to find an excuse no certainly not that s why i went home to talk to them both i feel i cannot never never is it too sudden my pretty i ll give you time i won t mention it again for a while she tried to skim again but her tears fell so that she could not do it she could never explain her sadness even to this her best friend clare began to talk more generally to calm her he talked about his father s religious views and the good work he did he mentioned the insults his father had received from a young man near trantridge who had a blind mother tess now looked hard and worn and her mouth was tragic clare did not notice they finished skimming and he said to her softly and my question tessy oh no no she replied hopelessly thinking bitterly of alec d urberville it can t be she went out with the other milkmaids to the cows in the fields angel watched her moving freely in the air like a swimmer on a wave he knew he was right to choose a wife from nature not from civilization clare was not depressed by tess s refusal feeling sure that she would finally accept him a few days later he asked her again tess why did you say no so positively i m not good enough not enough of a fine lady yes your family would not respect me you know you re wrong my father and mother would and i don t care about my brothers he held her to stop her slipping away you didn t mean it did you i can t work or read or play or anything until i know that you will some day be mine say you will tess she could only shake her head and look away then i ought not to hold you to talk to you like this why tess it is for your good my dearest i can t give myself the great happiness of promising to be yours because i am sure i ought not to but you will make me happy ah you think so but you don t know after a struggle like this tess would go to the fields or her room to cry her heart was so strongly on the side of his that she feared she might give way why doesn t somebody tell him all about me she thought it was only forty miles away somebody must know but nobody knew and nobody told him tess s life now had two parts positive pleasure and positive pain every time she and angel were alone together he would ask her again and she would refuse she was keeping her promise to herself but in her heart of hearts tess knew that eventually she would accept him love and nature both advised her to have him without thinking of complications to delight in passion without considering future pain i know i shall say yes i can t help it she cried to herself in bed one night but it may kill him when he knows oh oh i ve got some news for you all said dairyman crick as they sat down to breakfast one sunday morning it s that jack dollop again the lover in the butter churn said angel clare looking up from his newspaper and has he married the young milkmaid as he promised not he sir replied the dairyman he s married an older woman who had a year they married in a great hurry and then she told him that by marrying she d lost her a year he only married her for her money too so now they re always quarrelling she ought to have told him just before they went to church said marian she ought to have seen he only wanted her money and refused him said retty what do you say my dear the dairyman asked tess i think she ought to have told him the truth or else refused him i don t know replied tess who could not swallow her food she soon left the table and went into the fields feeling the pain in the story she had continued to refuse angel s offers of marriage but from that sunday he changed his approach towards her he looked for her and came to talk to her at every possible moment at milking butter making cheese making among chickens and among pigs she knew she could not resist much longer she loved him so passionately and he was so like a god in her eyes he treated her as if he would love and defend her under any circumstances this began to make her feel less afraid about agreeing to marry him and telling him the truth about herself the days were shorter now and in the mornings the dairy worked by candlelight one morning between three and four she ran up to clare s room to wake him before waking the others having dressed she was about to go downstairs when angel came out of his room and stopped her now miss he said firmly you must give me an answer or i shall have to leave the house you aren t safe with me i saw you just now in your nightdress well is it yes at last i really will think seriously about it mr clare call me angel then and not mr clare why not angel dearest it would mean i agree wouldn t it it would only mean you love me and you did admit that long ago very well then angel dearest if i must she murmured smiling clare could not resist kissing her warm cheek after milking and skimming all the dairy people went outside tess generously tried for the last time to interest angel in the other dairymaids there s more in those three than you think she said any of them would make you a better wife than i could and perhaps they love you as much as i do almost oh tessy he cried impatiently she was so relieved to hear this that she could not make any further self sacrifice she knew that this day would decide it in the late afternoon angel clare offered to drive the waggon with its buckets of milk to the station he persuaded tess to go with him at first there was silence as they drove along the quiet road simply enjoying being close to each other soon drops of rain started falling tess s cheeks were pink and her long hair was wet she had no jacket and crept close to clare she held an old piece of cloth over them both to keep the rain off well dear said angel what about my question i ll answer you soon before we get home i ll try they passed an old house angel explained that it was an interesting place which belonged to the ancient family of the d urbervilles it s very sad when a noble family dies out he said yes said tess at last they reached the station and watched the milk being lifted on to the train tess was fascinated londoners will drink it for breakfast won t they people who don t know we drove for miles in the rain so that it might reach them in time that s true but we drove a little for our own reasons too now tess he said anxiously as they drove away into the night your heart belongs to me why can t you give me your hand as well my only reason is you i have something to tell you i must fell you about my past life tell me if you want to dearest i expect you have had as many experiences as that flower over there i grew up in marlott and at school they said i would make a good teacher but there was trouble in my family father didn t work very hard and he drank a little poor child that s nothing new he held her more closely to his side and there is something unusual about me i i am not a durbeyfield but a d urberville i m a descendant of the same family who owned that house we passed a d urberville and is that the whole story tess yes she answered faintly well why should i love you less because of that the dairyman told me you hated old families he laughed well i hate the idea that noble blood should be more important than anything else but i am really very interested in your news what do you think of it i think it s sad especially here to see the fields which once belonged to my ancestors so that s the awful secret she had not told him at the last moment she had not been brave enough angel was delighted you see tess society likes a noble name and will accept you better as my wife because you are a d urberville even my mother will like you better you must use the name of d urberville from this very day i like the other name best but you must by the way there s someone who has taken the d urberville name near the chase yes he s the man who insulted my father how strange angel i would rather not take that name now then teresa d urberville i ve got you take my name and you will escape yours if it is sure to make you happy and you do wish to marry me very very much i do dearest of course say you will be mine for ever he held her and kissed her yes no sooner had she said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing angel was surprised why are you crying i m crying because i promised i would die unmarried oh i sometimes wish i had never been born tess how could you wish that if you really loved me i wish you could prove your love in some way will this prove it more cried tess desperately holding him close and kissing him for the first time clare learnt what a passionate woman s kisses were like on the lips of one she loved with all her heart and soul as tess loved him there now do you believe she asked wiping her eyes yes i never really doubted never they drove on in the darkness forming one bundle under the cloth i must write to my mother she said of course dear child where does she live in marlott ah then i have seen you before yes when you would not dance with me oh i hope that doesn t mean bad luck after this decision tess wrote an urgent letter to her mother this was the reply she received dear tess i hope you are well as i am we are all glad to hear you are going to be married soon but tess in answer to your question whatever you do don t tell your future husband anything about your past experience no girl would be so foolish especially as it is so long ago and not your fault at all remember you promised me you would never tell anybody best wishes to your young man love from your mother tess could not accept her mother s view of life but perhaps joan was right in this silence seemed best for angel s happiness so she grew calm and from october onwards she was completely happy clare seemed the perfect guide thinker and friend she saw perfection in his face his intelligence and his soul she dismissed the past from her mind they spent all their time together as country people do once they are engaged in the wonderful autumn afternoons they walked by streams crossing on little wooden bridges they saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges and at the same time bright sunshine in the fields the sun was so near the ground that the shadows of clare and tess stretched a quarter of a mile ahead of them like two long pointing fingers when clare talked to tess of their future and the farm they would have abroad she could hardly believe that she would be going through the world by his side her feeling for him was now the breath and life of tess s being it made her forget her past sorrows but she knew they were waiting like wolves for their moment to attack one day she cried out to angel why didn t you stay and love me when i was sixteen when you danced in marlott oh why didn t you ah yes if only i had known but you must not regret so bitterly why should you hiding her feelings quickly she said i would have had four more years of your love than i can ever have now they had to tell the dairyman and his wife that they were planning to marry that night as tess entered the bedroom all three dairymaids were waiting for her you are going to marry him said marian yes some day said tess going to marry him a gentleman said izz it s strange said marian to think tess will be his wife not a fine lady but a girl who lives like us do you all hate me for it asked tess in a low voice i want to hate you but i cannot said retty that s how i feel said marian and izz he ought to marry one of you murmured tess you are all better than i am no no dear tess they all said i think i ought to make him marry one of you even now she sobbed they went up to her and calmed her and helped her to bed before they went to sleep marian whispered you will think of us when you are his wife tess and how we did not hate you because we did not expect to be chosen by him the girls did not know that tess cried even more at this and that she decided she would tell angel all her history because of this she would not set a date for the wedding she wanted to stay as she was not move forward into a new life but soon it was clear that the dairyman did not want so many dairymaids at this time of year tess would have to leave the dairy at christmas i m afraid i m glad of it said angel to her because now we must decide when to marry we can t go on like this for ever i wish we could i wish it could be always summer and autumn with you always loving me i always shall oh i know you will angel i ll fix the day so they decided on st december the wedding was to take place as privately as possible at the dairy tess now felt she could not stop things happening and agreed passively to whatever angel suggested in fact angel s plans were a little hurried he had not meant to marry so soon but he wanted to keep her with him to help her with her reading and studying so that he could present her proudly as a lady to his parents he also planned to spend some time studying work in a flour mill they could spend their honeymoon staying in the old farmhouse which had once belonged to the d urbervilles while angel studied at the mill nearby the day the impossible day of their wedding came closer his wife tess said to herself could it ever be angel and tess decided to spend a day together shopping on christmas eve they went into town in a borrowed carriage the town was full of strangers who stared at tess happy and beautiful on angel s arm at the end of the day tess was waiting for angel to bring the horse and carriage when two men passed her in the street she s a lovely maiden one said to his friend she s lovely yes but she s no maiden replied the other angel returned at that moment and heard these words wildly angry at this insult to tess he hit the man in the face the man said quickly i m sorry sir i must have made a mistake angel accepted this gave the man some money said goodnight and drove off with tess the two men went in the opposite direction and was it a mistake asked the second man certainly not said his friend on the way home tess was very serious she felt she could not tell him the truth to his face but there was another way so she went to her room and wrote a four page letter describing exactly what had happened three or four years ago in the night she crept up to angel s room and pushed the letter under his door next morning she looked anxiously at him but he kissed her as usual he said nothing about the letter had he read it did he forgive her every morning and night he was the same until finally the wedding day came tess had not invited her family from marlott angel had written to his his brothers had not replied and his parents wrote that they hoped he was not hurrying into marriage but that he was old enough to decide for himself angel did not mind because he was planning to introduce tess to them as a d urberville as well as a dairymaid some months later tess was still worried about her confession and left the crowd of busy people downstairs to creep silently up to angel s bedroom there she found her letter unopened just under the carpet he had not seen it she could not let him read it now in the middle of the preparations she found him alone for a moment i must confess all my mistakes to you she said trying to keep her words light not today my sweet we ll have plenty of time later on i ll confess mine too then you really don t want me to i don t tessy really from now on her one desire to call him husband and then if necessary to die carried her on she moved in a cloud there were few people in the church at one point she let her shoulder touch clare s arm to be sure that he was really there it was only when she came out that she noticed the carriage they were driving back in she felt she must have seen it in a dream oh maybe you know the story of the d urberville carriage said angel and this one reminds you of it in the past a certain d urberville committed a crime in his carriage and since then d urbervilles see or hear the old carriage whenever but it s rather depressing to talk about is it when we are going to die angel or is it when we have committed a crime now tess he kissed her but she had no energy left she was now mrs angel clare but wasn t she really mrs alexander d urberville later that afternoon they left the dairy all the dairy people watched them leave and clare kissed the dairymaids goodbye as he was thanking the dairyman a cock crowed just in front of him that s bad whispered the dairymen to each other when a cock crows at a husband like that and they laughed together behind their hands go away shouted mr crick at the cock later he said to his wife why did it have to crow at mr clare like that it only means a change in the weather said mrs crick not what you think that s impossible tess and angel arrived at the old d urberville farmhouse it was empty although a woman came to cook and clean for them they had their tea together and clare delighted in eating from the same plate as tess looking at her he thought do i realize how important i am to this woman and how i must look after her i must never forget to think about her feelings it started to rain as it grew dark outside finally a man arrived from the dairy with their bags i m sorry i m late sir he said but terrible things have been happening at the dairy you remember the cock crowing well whatever it means poor little retty priddle has tried to drown herself what happened asked angel well after you left she and marian walked from one public house to another drinking retty was found in the river later on and marian was found drunk in a field and izz asked tess izz is at home as usual but very sad and depressed as the man left tess sat sadly by the fire looking into it they were simple innocent girls who had not been loved it was wicked of her to take all the love without paying for it she would pay she would tell there and then angel was sitting beside her holding her hand their faces were red in the firelight this morning he said suddenly we said we would both confess our mistakes i must tell you something and you must forgive me perhaps i ought to have told you before i ve put off telling you because i didn t want to lose you angel i m sure i ll forgive you a wild hope was making tess s heart beat faster well wait a minute you know how much i believe in goodness and purity but i myself when i was in london years ago did wrong with a woman i hardly knew it lasted two days i came home and i have never done anything like it since do you forgive me oh angel of course i do and i am almost glad because now you can forgive me i have a confession too ah yes well confess you wicked little girl it can hardly be more serious than mine it can t no it can t she jumped up joyfully at the hope no in fact it is just the same i will tell you now she sat down again they held hands the fire burned like a judgement day fire her shadow rose high on the wall putting her head against his she bravely told the whole story of her meeting with alec d urberville and its results the woman pays her story came to an end she had not raised her voice she had not cried but things seemed to change as the story progressed the fire looked as if it was laughing at her troubles all the objects around her appeared not to care about her tragic history and yet it was only a short time since he had been kissing her everything looked different now clare stirred the fire it was unnecessary but he felt he had to do something he had not really taken in the whole story yet he stood up now as he began to understand the story in its full horror his face was like an old man s he made uncertain movements because everything in his head was vague and uncertain he could not make himself think clearly tess can i believe this are you mad perhaps my wife my tess you aren t mad are you i am not she said and yet he said looking strangely at her why didn t you tell me before oh yes you would have told me in a way but i stopped you i remember he was talking but could not think at the same time his brain seemed to have stopped working he turned away from her tess followed him and stood there staring at him with dry eyes then she went down on her knees beside him in the name of our love forgive me she whispered with a dry mouth i have forgiven you for the same and as he did not answer she said again forgive me as you are forgiven i forgive you angel you yes you do but you do not forgive me oh tess it s not a question of forgiveness you were one person now you are another how can forgiveness put that right he paused considering this then suddenly he started laughing in an unnatural horrible way it was like a laugh out of hell don t don t she cried her face dead white it kills me that laugh angel do you know what you re doing to me i ve been hoping longing praying to make you happy i know that i thought angel that you loved me me my very self if you do love me how can you treat me like this it frightens me having begun to love you i will love you for ever in all changes in all troubles because you are yourself i ask no more then how can you my husband stop loving me i repeat the woman i have been loving is not you but who is she another woman in your shape suddenly she realized how he saw her for him she was a guilty woman pretending to be an innocent one there was terror in her white face as she saw this she could not stand and he stepped forward thinking she might fall sit down he said gently you are ill and i am not surprised she sat down her face still full of fear and her eyes wild i don t belong to you any more then do i angel she asked helplessly and at last the tears came clare watched her sobbing and waited until the first violence of her emotion had passed angel she said suddenly in a normal voice am i too wicked for us to live together i haven t had time to think what we should do i won t ask you to let me live with you angel because i have no right to i won t write to tell my family we are married as i said i would won t you no i won t do anything unless you order me to and if you go away i won t follow you and if you never speak to me again i won t ask why unless you tell me i can and if i order you to do anything i ll obey you even if i have to lie down and die how good of you but it seems you have changed in the past you were keen to look after yourself now you are keen to sacrifice yourself clare s bitter words however were not fully understood by tess she only knew that he was angry with her she stood silent not knowing that he was struggling with his love for her she did not observe a large tear rolling slowly down his cheek he was realizing what a change tess s confession had made to his whole life he had to decide on some action tess he said as gently as he could i can t stay here just now i m going out he quietly left the room two glasses of wine ready for their supper remained untouched on the table only two or three hours earlier they had drunk tea from the same cup as he closed the door behind him tess jumped up he had gone she could not stay she put out the candles and followed him the rain was over and the night was now clear clare walked slowly and without purpose his shape was black and frightening she walked just behind him there was water on the road where the stars could be seen reflected away from the house the road went through the fields she followed clare as a dog follows its owner eventually tess could not help speaking to him what have i done nothing interferes with my love for you you don t think i planned it angel do you i would not deceive you like that h m well no maybe you would not but you are not the same no not the same but don t make me blame you she went on begging for forgiveness perhaps she said things that would have been better left to silence angel angel i was a child when it happened i knew nothing of men i admit it was not so much your fault as his then won t you forgive me i do forgive you but forgiveness isn t everything and do you love me he did not answer this question oh angel my mother says she knows several cases which were worse than mine and the husband has not minded much well he has accepted it at least and in those cases the woman hasn t loved him as i love you don t tess don t argue those are just country people s ways there is a correct way of doing things i think that parson who discovered you were a d urberville should have kept quiet perhaps you were weak and could not refuse this man because your ancient noble blood has run thin because your family is no good any more i thought you were a child of nature but you have the worst of your ancient family in you tess accepted his bitterness not understanding the details he did not love her as he had done and nothing else mattered they went on again in silence they walked slowly for hours with sad anxious faces not talking one behind the other like a funeral procession tess said to her husband i don t want to cause you sadness all your life the river is down there i can put an end to myself in it i m not afraid don t talk like that do what i ask go back to the house and go to bed i will she said obediently when she returned to the house she found everything as they had left it and the fire still burning she went to the bedroom there was a mistletoe branch hanging above the bed now she understood why angel had brought a strange parcel with him it was to surprise her he had delightedly hung it there now it looked foolish and out of place as she had nothing more to fear and nothing more to hope for she lay down in a few moments lonely tess was asleep in the bedroom once used by the young wives of her ancestor later on that night clare also came back to the house he prepared a bed downstairs but crept shoeless upstairs to see if tess was asleep he was relieved to see her sleeping deeply and yet he felt he alone had the whole worry of what action to take and the responsibility for her life as well as his he turned away from her door and then turned back again pulled by his love for her but his eye was caught by a painting on the wall of one of tess s ancestors a proud fierce woman who looked as if she hated and wanted to deceive all men he thought she and tess looked alike that was enough to stop him and he went downstairs to his lonely bed he looked calm and cold full of self control his face showed he had fought against passion and won but did not like being the winner he still found it difficult to accept that tess the pure village maiden was not what she seemed how unexpected life could be he put out the candle the night came in unconcerned and uninterested the night which had swallowed up his happiness when clare woke up the next morning the sky was grey and the sun was not shining the fireplace in the room was full of cold ashes the two full glasses of wine still stood untouched on the table when the cleaning woman came he sent her away not wanting a third person in the house he found wood to make a fire and prepared breakfast people passing the farmhouse saw the smoke rising from the chimney and envied the newlymarried couple in their happiness breakfast is ready he called upstairs in a normal voice tess came down immediately she was already dressed but her hands and face were cold she had no fire in her bedroom where she had been sitting waiting for his call and staring at the dying mistletoe clare s polite words gave her a moment of hope which died however when she saw his face they were both in fact the ashes of their former fires after last night s passionate sorrow they both felt heavy and lacking in energy tess went up to angel touching him lightly with her fingers was this really the man who once loved her her eyes were bright her cheeks still round but her lips were pale she looked absolutely pure angel looked at her in wonder tess say it isn t true it can t be true it is true every word every word he world almost have preferred her to lie so that he could believe her blindly but she repeated it is true is he living asked angel the baby died but the man he is alive is he in england yes despair passed over clare s face he moved vaguely around the room look he said i thought any man would have thought that if i didn t look for knowledge good family and wealth in a wife if i sacrificed all that i would be sure of finding a country girl who was at least pure but but i should not accuse you tess understood his feelings perfectly she saw that he had lost in every way angel i would not have married you if i had not known that after all there is a way out for you only i hoped you would never she was close to tears a way out you can divorce me good heavens how can you be so stupid how can i divorce you can t you now i have told you everything oh tess you are so childish you don t understand the law no i can t there was shame and misery in tess s face i thought you could she whispered don t think i planned this i really believed you could take that way out oh then i ought to have done it last night but i didn t have the courage that s just like me the courage to do what he asked to put an end to myself where in the bedroom under your mistletoe with the rope from my box but i couldn t in the end i was afraid that people would talk and you would suffer from that clare was shaken by this unexpected confession now listen you must never think of such a wicked thing again promise me as your husband never to do anything like that i promise i see it was wicked but angel it was to set you free and to avoid a divorce which everyone would talk about but dying by my own hand is too good for me you my husband should kill me i think i would love you more if that were possible if you could bring yourself to do it i am so much in your way quiet don t talk about it well just as you wish i will do whatever you like they sat down to breakfast tired and sad they did not look at each other and they did not eat much angel left soon afterwards to start his studies at the flour mill nearby tess cleared the ashes from the fireplace cleaned the house and prepared the lunch waiting for his return at lunch they talked politely of work at the flour mill and methods of milling in the afternoon he went back to the mill and in the evening he studied his books and papers tess felt she was in his way and went to the kitchen he came to find her there don t work in the kitchen like this he said you re not my servant you re my wife she looked happier you mean i can think of myself as that she asked trembling what do you mean tess you are my wife of course i don t know she said with tears in her eyes i told you long ago i wasn t good enough for you and i m not good enough i was right but you persuaded me she turned her back on him sobbing as if her heart would break it would have won round any man but angel clare deep in him lay a hard logic which had resisted the church and now resisted tess she accepted his treatment of her as being what she deserved she would never have thought of criticizing his hardness to her he was still perfection another day passed by in the same way only once did tess try to get closer to her husband as he was leaving for the flour mill she put up her mouth to be kissed he ignored the invitation and said goodbye coldly she felt as if he had hit her how often had he wanted to kiss her in those happy days at talbothays but on his way to the mill angel regretted his coldness he wished he had been kinder to her and kissed her once at least so they lived through another day together in the same house but more separately than ever before clare was desperately wondering what to do tess no longer even hoped for forgiveness that evening she said bravely i suppose you aren t going to live with me long are you angel she found it difficult to control the muscles of her face no how can we live together as man and wife while that man lives he is your natural husband i m not if he were dead that might be different anyway have you thought of the future have you thought we might have children they would find out about this everybody would talk about it can you imagine them growing up under a cloud like that they would hate you for it tess s head was bent her eyes felt so heavy they were almost closed no i can t ask you to stay with me she whispered i hadn t thought of it like that she had hoped as women do that living together for a time would break down his coldness being near him every day was her only hope of winning him back but she had never imagined she might have children who would reject her she now remembered how she had criticized her mother for bringing babies into the world without being able to look after them she realized that she might have made the same mistake as joan durbeyfield she completely accepted angel s argument she could have argued that if they went as planned to farm in another country nobody would know about her past but perhaps she was right not to argue a woman knows not only her own sorrow but also her husband s he might keep the bitterness alive in his heart even if nobody knew or talked about it at all she had lost on the third day she said i accept what you say we must separate but what can you do i can go home clare had not thought of that can you really yes if i am with you all the time i may persuade you to stay against your better judgement then you and i would both be sorry i must go right said angel his face was pale but his voice was determined tess was slightly shocked he had agreed so quickly to her generous offer i didn t like to suggest it he said but as you have i think it s a good idea to part at least for a while god knows we may come togetner again one day so they both prepared to leave the following day that night tess was woken by a noise in the house at first she thought angel was coming to her bedroom and her heart beat wildly with joy but then she saw his eyes staring emptily ahead of him and knew he was walking in his sleep he came to the middle of her room and said very sadly dead dead dead poor darling tess so sweet so good so pure my wife dead these words which he would never say when awake were very sweet to tess she would not have moved to save her life she lay in absolute stillness trying not to breathe wondering what he was going to do with her her trust in him was complete he picked her up and carried her to the stairs was he going to throw her down she knew he was leaving her the next day perhaps for ever she almost hoped they would fall and die together he continued downstairs taking her out of the house towards the river she had given herself totally up to him and did not care what happened to her as long as she was with him they arrived at a place where the river was fast and deep and angel started to cross it on the narrow footbridge still holding tess perhaps he wanted to drown her even that would be better than separation as they crossed the water rushed fiercely below them if tess had moved in his arms they would both have fallen into the dangerous water but she had no right to take his life although her own was worthless so she stayed still angel walked purposefully towards a ruined church near the river against the old wall was an empty stone tomb in this he carefully laid tess and kissing her lips sighed deeply and happily he immediately lay down on the ground next to the tomb and looked fast asleep tess stepped out of the tomb and managed to persuade angel to walk back to the house without waking him it was very cold outside and both had only night clothes on she helped him to his sofa bed in the living room and he still did not wake up next morning he seemed to remember nothing of the night s experiences and tess did not refer to his sleepwalking they finished packing and left the farmhouse where they had hoped to be so happy after driving some distance angel stopped the carriage to get down and continue on foot tess was going further on in the carriage he spoke seriously to her as they separated now remember he said i am not angry with you but i cannot bear to live with you at the moment i will try to accept it but until i come to you you should not try to come to me the punishment seemed a heavy one to tess had she really deserved this may i write to you oh yes if you are ill or need anything you probably won t so i might be the first to write i agree to the conditions angel because you know best only don t make it too much for me to bear that was all she said if she had sobbed or fainted or begged him he would probably have given way but she made it easy for him he gave her some money and they said goodbye he stood on the road watching the carnage continue up the hill secretly hoping that tess would look back but she was lying half dead with misery inside he turned to walk on alone not realizing thai he still loved her as the carriage drove on through blackmoor vale tess now began to awake from her sorrow and wonder how she could face her parents she left the carriage and came into marlott on foot when she entered the little cottage her mother was doing the washing as usual why tess she cried when she saw her daughter i thought you were married really married this time yes mother i am then where s your husband gone away for a time gone away when were you married then tuesday as you said yes mother married on tuesday and today it s only saturday and he s gone away what strange husbands you seem to find tess mother tess ran across to joan and put her head on joan s shoulder you told me i mustn t tell him but i did i couldn t help it and he went away oh you fool you little fool cried her mother i know i know sobbed tess but he was so good i couldn t lie to him and if only you knew how much i loved him and how much i wanted to marry him well it s too late now said mrs durbeyfield whatever will your father say he was very proud of your marriage he s been telling them at the public house that you ll help his noble family become great again oh there he is now tess ran upstairs but through the thin walls she could hear the whole story being told to sir john people will laugh at me in the village he said do you think he really did marry her joan or is it like the first tess could listen no more even her own family did not believe her she could not stay she gave her mother half the money which clare had given her and told her family she was going to join him and so she left marlott again looking for work angel clare also returned home he had spent three weeks since his wedding trying to remain calm and continue his studies but with the disturbing picture of tess always in his mind he was beginning to wonder if he had treated her unfairly she had been so much a part of his plans for the future that he was now thinking of countries where they could farm together the idea of brazil attracted him the countryside people and habits would be so different perhaps they could make a new life there together so he went back to emminster to tell his parents his new plan but where s your wife dear angel cried his mother when he arrived she s at her mother s for the moment i ve come home in rather a hurry because i ve decided to go to brazil brazil but they re all roman catholics there are they i hadn t thought of that but mr and mrs clare were even more interested in their son s marriage than in brazil s religion angel we do want to meet your wife we are not in the least angry about this rather hurried wedding so why haven t you brought her it seems strange angel explained that she would be staying at her mother s while he went to brazil alone to see if the country was suitable he planned to bring her to meet his parents before he went there a second time with her but his mother was disappointed at not seeing tess she watched her son as he ate and asked questions is she very pretty she certainly is and a maiden of course of course i imagine you were her first love exactly his father asked no questions but when the moment for evening prayers arrived he chose a passage from the bible this passage is very suitable as you are here angel it is in praise of a pure wife we shall all think of her as your father reads it added his mother as they listened to the ancient beautiful words angel felt like crying his mother said you see angel the perfect woman the bible tells us is a working woman not a fine lady a girl just like your wife a girl who uses her hands and heart and head for others i wish i could have met her angel as she is pure she is fine enough for me clare s eyes were full of tears he quickly said goodnight and went to his room his mother followed and stood at his door looking anxiously at him angel why are you going away so soon have you quarrelled with your wife in these three weeks angel is she is she a woman with a past the mother s instinct had found the cause of her son s worries she is totally pure he replied and felt that he had to tell that lie even if he went to hell there and then for it then never mind the rest there are few better things in nature than a pure country girl clare felt furious with tess because she had forced him to deceive his parents then he remembered her sweet voice and the touch of her fingers on his face and her warm breath on his lips but this well meaning young man despite his advanced ideas was still limited in his thinking he could not see that tess was in character as pure as the pure wife in the bible the next day clare left emminster and began to prepare for his journey to brazil one day returning from doing some business with a farmer he happened to meet one of the dairymaids from talbothays izz huett he knew her secret she was an honest girl who loved him and who might have made as good a farmer s wife as tess he learnt from izz that of the other dairymaids retty had become ill and marian had started drinking and izz herself suppose i had asked you to marry me izz he asked i would have said yes and you would have had a woman who loved you a wild anger took hold of clare society and its rules had trapped him in a corner why shouldn t he take his revenge on society i m going to brazil izz without tess we have separated for personal reasons i may never be able to love you but will you come with me yes i will said izz after a pause you know it s wrong in the eyes of the world don t you do you love me very much more than tess i do yes oh i do love you but not more than tess nobody could she would have laid down her life for you clare was silent a sob rose inside him he heard izz s words again and again in his head she would have laid down her life for you i m sorry izz he said suddenly please forget what i said just now i must be mad oh please take me oh i shouldn t have been so honest sobbed izz izz by your honesty you have saved me from doing something wicked thank you for that and please forgive me and so angel said goodbye to the miserable girl but he did not turn towards tess s village he continued with his plan and five days later left the country for brazil and so the months passed tess found occasional dairy work for the spring and summer she sent all angel s money to her family who as usual had many expenses and hardly any income she was too proud to ask angel s family for more money that winter she went to work at another farm where marian was working here the earth was poor and the work was difficult but tess did not mind the hard work in the fields as she and marian dug out the vegetables in the pouring rain they talked of talbothays and of the sunny green fields and of angel clare tess did not tell marian everything so marian could not understand why the couple were apart they wrote to izz asking her to join them if she had no other work it was the coldest winter for years but tess and marian had to go on working in the snow tess realized that the farmer was the same trantridge man who had recognized her in the market town and had been knocked down by angel he made her work twice as hard as the others when izz came tess saw her whispering to marian tess had a feeling it was important is it about my husband she asked marian later well yes izz said i shouldn t tell but he asked her to run away to brazil with him tess s face went as white as the snow on the ground what happened he changed his mind but he was going to take her tess burst out crying i must write to him it s my fault i shouldn t have left it to him he said i could write to him i ve been neglecting him but in the evening in her room she could not finish her letter to him she looked at her wedding ring which she wore round her neck in the day and kept on her finger all night what kind of husband would ask izz to go to brazil with him so soon after parting from his wife but this new information made her think again of visiting angel s family in emminster she wanted to know why he had not written to her she could meet his parents who would surely be kind to her in her loneliness so she decided to walk there from the farm at flintcomb ash on a sunday her only free day it was fifteen miles each way she dressed in her best encouraged by marian and izz who sent her on her way at four o clock in the morning the girls sincerely loved tess and wished for her happiness it was a year since her wedding and on that bright cold morning her unspoken hope was to win over her husband s family and so persuade him back to her although she started cheerfully she began to lose her courage as she approached emminster the church looked forbidding perhaps the rather strict parson would not approve of her travelling so far on a sunday but she had to go on she took off her thick walking boots and hid them behind a tree changing into her pretty shoes she would collect the boots on the way out of town she took a deep breath and rang the bell at the parson s house nobody answered she tried again silence it was almost with relief that she turned and walked away then she suddenly remembered that they must all be at church so she waited in a quiet part of the street until people began to stream out of church she immediately recognized angel s brothers and even overheard some of their conversation poor angel one of them said there s that nice girl mercy chant why on earth didn t he marry her instead of rushing into marriage with a dairymaid it s certainly very strange but his ideas have always been most odd they joined mercy chant as she came out of church and walked together along the road tess had walked into emminster look here s a pair of old boots said one of the brothers noticing tess s boots behind the tree excellent walking boots i see said miss chant how wicked to throw them away give them to me i ll find a poor person who would like them tess walked quickly past them tears running down her face she continued walking as fast as she could away from emminster how unlucky that she had met the sons and not the father angel s parents would have taken poor lonely tess to their hearts immediately as they did every other lost soul without thought of family or education or wealth she grew more and more tired and depressed as she walked the fifteen miles back to flintcomb ash where only hard work awaited her but on the way she noticed a crowd listening to a preacher and she stopped for a while to join them the preacher was describing with enthusiasm how he had been wicked for years and how a certain parson had pointed it out to him this had gradually turned him from wickedness but tess was more shocked by the voice than the words she moved round behind the crowd to look at his face as the afternoon sun shone full on him she recognized alec d urberville a changed man this was the first time she had seen or heard of d urberville since she had left trantridge and although he stood there openly as a preacher as a religious man she still felt afraid of him he had changed his clothes his hair his moustache and his expression but could she really believe that he had changed his most secret thoughts and beliefs as soon as she recovered from her surprise she moved away so that he would not notice her but he suddenly caught sight of her and the effect on him was electric his enthusiasm faded his voice hesitated his lips trembled his eyes dropped in confusion tess walked rapidly away along the road however as she walked she felt he must be looking at her back as she walked away and now she knew she could never escape the past as she had hoped reminders of her past would surround her until she died as she walked uphill she heard footsteps behind her and turning saw that it was the one person in the whole world she did not want to meet this side of the grave tess he said i m alec d urberville i see you are she said coldly they walked on together you may wonder why i m following you well i feel you are the person i would most like to save from hell so i have come to do that have you saved yourself tess asked bitterly god has done it all not me i must tell you how i came to believe in him have you ever heard of the parson of emminster old mr clare a very strict sincere man i have said tess well he came to trantridge once and tried to show me how wicked my life was i insulted him at the time but later my mother died and somehow i began to think about what old mr clare said since then my one desire has been to help others to understand god too don t go on cried tess i can t believe in such a sudden change i almost hate you for talking to me like this when you know how you ve ruined my life you enjoy yourself for a while and then you make sure of your place in heaven as she spoke she looked him full in the face with her great beautiful eyes don t look at me like that said alec your eyes remind me of well women s faces have too much power over me don t look at me it might be dangerous for you eventually they came to a crossroads where a strange stone stood it was a lonely unfriendly place where people did not like to stay for long alec stopped here i must go to the right here i m preaching at six this evening tell me how has your life been since we last met tess told him about the baby alec was shocked you should have told me but before we part come put your hand on this stone it was once a holy cross i m afraid of your power over me swear on the cross that you will never tempt me into wickedness good god how can you ask such an unnecessary thing i don t want to see you ever again no but swear it tess placed her hand on the stone and swore i shall pray for you called alec as he walked away who knows we may meet again tess went on her way feeling upset and soon met a man on the road he told her that the cross was not religious but marked the place where a criminal was put to death and buried trembling a little at this information she finally arrived at flintcomb ash one day the following week when tess was working in the fields as usual alec d urberville came to see her he explained to her that he intended to sell his land at trantridge and go to help poor people in africa will you help me put right the wicked thing i did to you will you be my wife oh no sir she cried horrified why not disappointment was visible in his face it was not only duty which pushed him to make this offer but also his old passion for her you know i don t love you answered tess in fact i love somebody else perhaps that is only a passing feeling no yes why not you must tell me well then i have married him ah he cried and looked hard at her it s a secret here she begged please don t tell anybody who is he asked d urberville where is he why isn t he here to look after you what sort of husband can he be leaving you to work like this don t ask cried tess her eyes flashing your eyes whispered alec i thought i no longer felt anything for you but when i look into your eyes he took her hand she pulled it quickly away go now please in the name of your new religion go respect me and my husband don t worry i can control myself i just hoped that our marriage would take away the bad in both of us but that plan is no good now he walked slowly away his head bent in thought the farmer approached at that moment and was angry with tess for wasting time talking to a stranger tess preferred hard words from this man of stone to sweet ones from alec d urberville for a moment however she imagined escaping from her present hard life by marrying alec but rejected it immediately at home that night she began a letter to clare telling him of her great love for him reading between the lines he would have seen her secret fear for the future but again she could not finish the letter thinking of his offer to lzz and so he never received it on a sunday in february she was eating her lunch in the cottage where she lived when d urberville knocked at the door he rushed in and threw himself into a chair tess he cried desperately i can t help it i can t stop thinking of you pray for me tess tess did not pity him i cannot because i don t believe god would change his plans just because i asked him who told you that my husband ah your dear husband tell me what he believes tess explained as clearly as she could remember angel s beliefs alec watched her closely the fact is you just believe whatever he says that s just like you women ah that s because he knows everything tess replied with enthusiasm what is good enough for him is good enough for me h m interesting murmured d urberville perhaps he understands religion better than old mr clare perhaps he s right not to attach too much importance to the bible and to fixed ideas perhaps i was wrong to become a preacher today i should be preaching at half past two and here i am my passion for you was too strong for me you have let all those people down they are waiting for you what do i care you are the one woman i have always wanted why have you tempted me away from religion i can t resist you his black eyes flashed passionately he advanced towards her i couldn t help your seeing me again cried tess moving nervously away from him please leave me remember i am married remember i can t defend myself alec stopped turned and went out without another word but he went on thinking of angel s religious logic as explained by tess it seemed to make sense that clever husband doesn t know that his ideas may lead me back to her he laughed to himself in march the threshing machine came for a day to flintcomb ash it was a huge red machine which ate all the corn the farm workers could feed it next to it stood the engine which ran it and the engineer he lived in a world of fire and smoke and was permanently black as if he came from hell the farmer put tess next to the threshing machine so that she had the hardest and most tiring job of all she had little chance to talk or rest and at lunch time was about to start eating when she noticed d urberville approaching he had changed his parson s clothes and now looked just like the young gentleman she had first met at trantridge i am here again you see he said smiling at her why do you bother me like this she cried you trouble me your eyes look at me night and day i can t forget them tess when you told me about that child of ours my feelings for you became strong again i have lost interest in religion and it is your fault you have stopped preaching asked tess shocked i have what a lot of stupid people they are to listen to a preacher anyway and i am convinced that your wonderful husband s views are better than old parson clare s i don t know how i became so enthusiastic so now here i am my love just as in the old times not like that at all no now it s different she said firmly oh why couldn t you stay religious because you ve explained your husband s ideas so well to me that i accept them ha ha but seriously tess you need help i am here and this husband of yours is not come with me my carriage is waiting the other side of the field you have tempted me now share my life for ever he put an arm round her waist tess was red with anger but said nothing she picked up a heavy leather glove and hit him in the face with it it was an action which her ancestors must have often practised alec jumped up and wiped the blood from his mouth remember one thing he said angrily only just controlling himself as he held her by the shoulders remember my lady if you are any man s wife you are mine i will have you again i ll come back for an answer later on so he left and the farm workers started the afternoon s threshing it went on until the evening as the work had to be finished that day tess became more and more exhausted and was near to fainting when they finally stopped alec d urberville who had been waiting for this moment appeared at her side you are so weak he said holding her arm i ve told the farmer he should not use women for work with the threshing machine it s too hard i ll walk home with you oh yes please do murmured tess too tired to be afraid of him you are kind sometimes and at least you wanted to put right the wrong by offering to marry me if i can t marry you at least i can help you i have finished with religion but you must trust me i have enough money to help your family and make them comfortable have you seen them lately asked tess quickly god knows they need help but no no i can take nothing from you either for them or for me please leave me alone as soon as she reached her room she wrote a passionate letter to angel my own husband i must call you that i must ask you for help i have no one else i am so open to temptation angel i cannot tell you who it is can t you come to me now before anything terrible happens i know you are far away but i need help i know i deserved the punishment you gave me but please angel please be kind to me if you would come i could die in your arms i live only for you don t think i shall be bitter because you left me i am so lonely without you my darling haven t you ever felt one little bit of your love for me at the dairy i am the same woman you fell in love with then the very same as soon as i met you the past was dead for me can t you see this how silly i was to trust that you would always love me i ought to have known i couldn t be so lucky people say i am still rather pretty angel but i don t care about my looks because you are not here if you won t come to me could i come to you i m so worried i m afraid i may fall into some wicked trap save me from what threatens me your faithful heartbroken tess this desperate cry for help eventually arrived at the parson s house in emminster old mr clare was pleased i think this letter is from angel s wife i hope this will bring him home more quickly he did say he was planning to come home next month dear boy i hope he will get home safely murmured mrs clare i still feel he should have gone university like the other two he should have had the same chance as them church or no church this was the only complaint she ever made to her husband he too was worried that he had been unfair to angel they blamed themselves for this unfortunate marriage if angel had studied at cambridge he would never have become a farmer and married a country girl still his more recent letters showed that angel was planning to come home to fetch her so perhaps their quarrel whatever it was could be settled angel himself was at this moment riding across brazil towards the coast he had never completely recovered from the serious illness he had had when he first arrived he was not as strong as before and looked much older the country had been a disappointment to him many farmers had come here from england hoping to make their fortune and had died in the fields or on the roads he knew now he could not farm here his attitude to life had changed during this time he began to look again at what was right and wrong he began to see that a person should be judged not only on what he has done but also on what he wanted to do he began to think that he had perhaps been unfair to tess and he thought about her with growing affection he wondered why she had not written he forgot that he had told her not to write first he did not realize that she was obeying his orders exactly although it was breaking her heart on his journey he travelled with another englishman they were both depressed and both told each other their problems the stranger was older and more experienced than angel he had a different more open approach to life he told angel clearly that he was wrong in parting from tess the next day they got wet in a thunderstorm the stranger fell ill and died a few days later death came as no surprise in that unfriendly land clare buried him and continued his journey the man s words were somehow given greater importance by his unexpected death and suddenly clare felt ashamed tess had committed no crime he should believe in her character and not object to a past action she could not avoid he remembered the words of izz huett she would have laid down her life for you no woman could do more how she had looked at him on their wedding day as if he were a god and during that terrible evening by the fireside when she told him her story how desperately sad she had been to realize he might not love her any more meanwhile tess was not hopeful that angel would come in answer to her letter the past had not changed so he might not change either nevertheless she spent her spare time preparing for his possible return practising singing the songs he used to like tears rolling down her cheeks all the while one evening she was in the cottage as usual when there was a knock at the door a tall thin girl came in and tess recognized her young sister liza lu liza lu said tess what s the matter mother is very ill her sister said seriously and father is not well either and says a man of such noble family shouldn t have to work so we don t know what to do tess thought for a moment she realized she had to go home immediately although her time was not yet up at the farm she left her sister to rest for a while and she herself set off at once with her possessions in a basket although it was night and she had a fifteen mile walk she felt quite safe she was only worried about her mother and did not notice the strange shapes of trees and hedges in the darkness at three in the morning she passed the field where she had first seen angel clare and felt again the disappointment when he did not dance with her and when she saw the family cottage it seemed to be part of her body and life as it always did she found her mother recovering from her illness and took over as head of the household her father did not seem ill and had a new plan for earning money i m going to find all the historians round here he said and get them to pay money to keep me going after all they pay to look after old ruins and i m of historical interest i think they ll be pleased to do it tess did not have time to answer she nursed her mother fed the children and worked in the garden planting vegetables for next year she enjoyed working outside among her neighbours one evening when it was almost dark she was digging happily in the vegetable garden some distance from the cottage it was a clear fresh night with smoke blowing about from small fires in the gardens suddenly she saw a man s face in the light of a fire it was d urberville she gasped and stepped back her face pale what are you doing here my dear tess i just want to help you to see you have you finished at that farm yes i have where are you going next to join your dear husband oh i don t know she said bitterly i have no husband that is quite true in one way but you have a true friend when you go back to your cottage you ll see what i ve done for you oh alec i wish you wouldn t give me anything i i have enough i i just don t want to live at all her tears fell as she started digging again when she looked round d urberville had left on her way back one of her sisters rushed towards her shouting tess tess mother is much better but father is dead but father was only a little bit ill said tess trying to take in the news he dropped down just now and the doctor said there was no hope for him because it s his heart poor john durbeyfield s death had more importance than his family realized at first the cottage was in his name on his death the farmer who owned it decided to put farm workers in it and told the durbeyfields to leave they were not much respected in the village because of john s laziness tess also felt guilty that her presence might have influenced the farmer the village people clearly thought she was not a good example for their children so on lady day the durbeyfields had to leave their old home the night before they left d urberville came to visit tess to offer her and her family a little house on his land at trantridge her mother could look after the chickens and he would pay for the children to go to school tess firmly rejected his offer but when he had gone for the first time a feeling of anger rose in her against her husband she had never intended to do wrong and he had punished her too hard she passionately wrote these few words to him oh why have you treated me so badly angel i do not deserve it you are cruel i intend to forget you you have been so unfair to me t she ran out and posted it before she could change her mind i see there s been a visitor said her mother coming into the living room later your husband was it no it wasn t him he ll never never come said tess hopelessly she had said it was not her husband but she was feeling more and more that d urberville was physically her husband next day their possessions were put on a waggon and taken to kingsbere mrs durbeyfield had booked rooms there as it was the family home of the d urbervilles and she still hoped some good would come of belonging to the ancient family but as they approached kingsbere after a long and tiring day s journey a man came to tell them there were no rooms available tess and her mother unloaded the waggon and left the children and furniture near the churchyard wall while they looked for somewhere to stay but all the rooms were full tess looked desperately at the pile of their possessions in the cold sunlight of this spring evening the furniture looked old and the pots looked worn tombs belong to families for ever don t they asked her mother brightly having looked round the churchyard well that s where we ll stay children until the place of your ancestors finds us some shelter tess helped her mother move the big bed against the church wall underground were the tombs of the d urbervilles and at the head of the bed was a beautiful old window in which the symbols on the durbeyfield seal and spoon could be seen the children were put to bed all together for warmth and comfort tomorrow we ll find somewhere better said joan cheerfully but tess what s the good of you playing at marrying gentlemen if it leaves us like this tess went inside the ancient church and stared sadly at the tombs of her ancestors she thought she saw a movement and turned to look again at a stone figure lying on a tomb when she saw it was alec d urberville lying there she almost fainted i m going to help you he said jumping up and smiling at her you ll see that i m more useful than a real d urberville i ll see your mother you ll thank me for this as he brushed past her she dropped her head on to the cold stone of the tomb why am i on the wrong side of this stone she whispered marian and izz had seen tess moving house with her family and knew what a difficult position she was in they generously hoped she would one day be happy with angel again and were afraid for her knowing that alec d urberville was constantly tempting her they decided to write a letter to angel clare to inform him of the dangerous situation his wife was in this is what they wrote dear sir watch out for your wife if you love her as much as she loves you she is in danger from an enemy in the shape of a friend a woman s strength cannot last for ever and water if it drops continually will wear away a stone yes even a diamond from two well wishers the end it was evening in the parson s house at emminster mr and mrs clare were waiting anxiously for angel s return he won t be here yet my dear said old mr clare as his wife went to the front door for the tenth time remember his train doesn t come in till six o clock and then he has to ride ten miles on our old horse but he used to do it in an hour said his wife impatiently both knew it was useless to talk about it and the only thing to do was wait when they heard footsteps they rushed outside to meet the shape in the darkness oh my boy my boy home at last cried mrs clare who at that moment cared no more for angel s lack of religion than for the dust on his clothes what woman in fact however firm her beliefs would not sacrifice her religion for her children nothing was more important to mrs clare than angel s happiness but as soon as they reached the living room she saw his face clearly in the light of the candles she gave a cry and turned away in sorrow oh it s not the angel who went away even his father was shocked to see the change in his son they would not have recognized him if they had passed him in the street the cruel climate and hard work had aged him by twenty years he was like a shadow thin and bony with no spring in his step and no enthusiasm in his eyes i was ill over there he said noticing his parents concern he had to sit down being weak after his journey has any letter come for me he asked eagerly the last one from your wife yes i didn t get it until very recently as i was travelling if i had received it earlier i would have come sooner they gave him a letter that had been waiting for his arrival angel read it rapidly it was tess s last letter short and desperate oh why have you treated me so badly angel i do not deserve it you are cruel i intend to forget you you have been so unfair to me t it is all quite true cried angel hopelessly throwing down the letter perhaps she will never take me back angel don t worry so much about a country girl said his mother anxious about her son s state of mind you know i ve never told you but she is actually a descendant of one of the oldest noblest families in england a d urberville in fact and do you know why i left her how could i be so narrow minded i left her because i discovered she was not the pure country girl i thought she had been seduced by a so called gentleman but it wasn t her fault and i know now that her whole character is honest and faithful i must get her back after this outburst angel went to bed early and thought about the situation in brazil it had seemed easy to rush straight back into tess s loving arms whenever he chose to forgive her however now he knew she was angry with him for leaving her for so long he admitted she was right to be angry so he decided to give her time to think about their relationship and wrote to her at marlott instead of going to see her to his surprise he received in reply a note from her mother dear sir my daughter is not with me at the moment and i don t know when she ll come back i will let you know when she does i cannot tell you where she is staying we don t live in marlott any more yours j durbeyfield at first clare decided to wait for further information from tess s mother but then he re read the letter sent on to him in brazil written from flintcomb ash i live only for you don t think i shall be bitter because you left me i am so lonely without you my darling haven t you ever felt one little bit of your love for me at the dairy i am the same woman you fell in love with then the very same as soon as i met you the past was dead for me he was so touched he felt he must go immediately to find her however angry she and her family might be with him while he was packing the letter from izz and marian arrived and made him hurry even more his search for tess took him first to flintcomb ash where he discovered she had never used her married name he began to realize too what hardship she had suffered rather than ask his family for money next he travelled to marlott but found the durbeyfield cottage occupied by others as he left the village he passed the field where he had first seen tess at the dance he could not bear to see it because tess was not there in the churchyard he saw a new headstone on which was written in memory of john durbeyfield rightly d urberville of the once powerful family of that name and direct descendant of sir pagan d urberville died march th a gravedigger noticed clare looking at it and called to him ah sir that man didn t want to be buried here but in his ancestors tombs at kingsbere so why wasn t he buried there no money in fact sir even this headstone has not been paid for clare went immediately to pay the bill for the stone and set out towards shaston where he found mrs durbeyfield and her children living in a small house she seemed embarrassed to see him i m tess s husband he said awkwardly i want to see her at once you were going to write and tell me where she is is she well i don t know sir but you ought to you re right i ought to know that about my own wife where is she mrs durbeyfield would not reply do you think tess would want me to try and find her i don t think she would he was turning away and then he thought of tess s letter if you would come i could die in your arms i live only for you i am so lonely without you my darling he turned back i m sure she would he said passionately i know her better than you do i expect you do sir for i have never really known her please mrs durbeyfield please tell me where she is please be kind to a miserable lonely man there was a pause after this cry from the heart finally tess s mother replied in a low voice she is at sandbourne thank you he said relieved do you need anything no thank you sir said joan durbeyfield we are well provided for clare took the train to sandbourne on his arrival at eleven o clock in the evening he took a room in a hotel and walked around the streets in the hope of meeting tess but it was too late to ask anybody it seemed a strange place to clare it was a bright fashionable holiday town with parks flowerbeds and amusements this new town a product of modern civilization had grown up near the ancient egdon woods where the paths over the hills had not changed for a thousand years he walked up and down the wide streets trying to admire the modern buildings he felt confused the sea murmured and he thought it was the trees the trees murmured and he thought it was the sea he could not understand what had brought tess here this was a town for relaxation for pleasure not for a working girl like tess there were no cows to milk here and no vegetables to dig he looked at the lights in the bedroom windows and wondered which one was hers before going to bed he re read tess s passionate letter he could not sleep that night at the post office next morning they knew nothing of the names of clare or durbeyfield but there is the name of d urberville at mrs brooks said the postman that s it cried clare pleased to think she had taken her ancestors name as he had suggested he made his way quickly to mrs brooks house following the postman s directions it was a large impressive house and he wondered if he should go to the back door as tess was probably a servant here but he rang at the front mrs brooks herself appeared is teresa d urberville here he asked mrs d urberville yes he felt pleased that she was known there as a married woman please tell her that a relation wants to see her say it s angel mr angel no just angel she ll know angel waited in the sitting room his heart beating painfully whatever will she think of me he thought i look so different so much older he was still weak after his illness he could hardly stand and held on to the back of a chair as she entered the room he was not prepared for what he saw tess was wearing fashionable clothes and looked even more beautiful than he remembered he had held out his arms but they fell to his side because she stood still in the doorway he thought she could not bear his changed appearance tess he whispered his voice was low and breaking with emotion can you forgive me for going away can t you come to me why are you so beautiful it is too late she said her voice hard and her eyes shining unnaturally i didn t see you as you really were please forgive me tessy he begged too late too late she said waving her hand impatiently don t come close angel keep away but is it that you don t love me my dear wife because i ve been ill i ve come to find you my parents will welcome you i ve told them everything yes yes but it is too late every moment seemed like an hour to her she felt as if she was in a dream trying to escape but unable to don t you know what has happened i waited and waited for you but you didn t come and i wrote to you and you didn t come he kept on saying you would never come back again and he was very kind to my family after father s death he i don t understand he has won me back to him clare stared at her he saw her fashionable clothes he saw her relaxed well fed body he saw her white delicate hands at last he understood and fell into a chair as if hit on the head she continued he is upstairs i hate him now because he told me a lie that you would never return and you have returned will you go away now angel please and never come back they looked at each other without joy and without hope desperately wanting to be sheltered from reality it s my fault said clare but talking did not help the tess he had first loved had separated her body from her soul her soul remained and would remain faithful to him for ever but what happened to her body no longer interested her after he had rejected it after a few moments of confused reflection he realized tess had left the room his mind was in a fog he felt very cold and very ill somehow he found himself in the street walking although he did not know where mrs brooks was not usually curious about her guests she was too interested in the money they paid her to ask many questions however angel clare s visit to her wealthy guests mr and mrs d urberville as she knew them was unusual enough to interest her she could hear parts of the conversation between the two lost souls and when tess went back upstairs mrs brooks crept quietly up to listen outside the bedroom door she heard tess sobbing and through the keyhole could see her half lying over the breakfast table and then my dear husband came home to me and it s too late because you persuaded me you with your fine words as you did when you seduced me you told me he would never come back but he did and you helped my family that s how you persuaded me so cleverly but when i believed you and came to live with you he came back and now i ve lost him a second time and this time for ever he will hate me now she turned her tear stained face and mrs brooks could see how she was suffering and he s dying he looks as if he s dying it will be my fault if he dies you have destroyed my life and his i can t bear it i can t the man spoke sharply and after that there was silence mrs brooks went back downstairs to wait until she was called to take their breakfast away she could hear tess moving about and then saw tess leave the house fully dressed in her fashionable clothes perhaps mr d urberville was still asleep as he did not like getting up early mrs brooks wondered who this morning s visitor was and where mrs d urberville had gone so early just then she noticed a mark on the ceiling it seemed to be spreading it was red and when she stood on the table and touched it it looked like blood she ran up to listen at the bedroom door again the dead silence was broken only by a regular drip drip drip she ran wildly out into the street and begged a man she knew to come back with her together they hurried upstairs and pushed open the bedroom door the breakfast lay untouched on the table but the large knife was missing they found it in alec d urberville s heart he lay on the bed pale fixed dead still bleeding soon the news spread all over sandbourne that mrs brooks guest had been killed by his young wife meavwhile angel clare returned to his hotel and sat for a while over breakfast staring into space a note arrived from his mother saying that his brother cuthbert was going to marry mercy chant clare threw away the paper at last he got up paid the bill and went to the railway station but he could not sit patiently and wait for the next train in an hour s time he had nothing to wish for in life and nobody to love he was in no hurry but just wanted to get out of that town as soon as possible so he started walking along the road out of town the road was open and dropped down to cross a valley when he was climbing the far side of the valley he stopped for breath and something made him turn round there was a small black figure in the distance a human figure running clare waited it looked like a woman but he never imagined that it could be his wife until she came close and he saw it was less i saw you turn on to the road from the station and i ve been following you all this way she was pale breathless and trembling he did not question her but took her arm and helped her along they took a footpath under some trees to avoid being seen angel she said do you know why i ve been running after you to tell you that i ve killed him there was a pitiful smile on her white face as she spoke what he cried thinking her mind was disturbed i don t know how i did it she said i had to do it for you and me angel i was afraid long ago when i hit him in the mouth with that heavy glove that i might kill him one day he has come between us and ruined our lives i never loved him at all angel you believe me don t you oh why did you go away when i loved you so much but i don t blame you angel only will you forgive me now i could not bear losing you any longer i had to kill him say you love me now say you do oh i do love you tess i do it has all come back he said holding her tightly in his arms but what do you mean you ve killed him he is dead he heard me crying about you and he called you rude names i couldn t bear it so i killed him eventually angel came to believe that she probably had killed d urberville he was amazed at the strength of her feeling and this it seemed had made her forget the difference between right and wrong she did not seem to realize what she had done and laid her head on his shoulder crying with happiness he wondered if the bad blood of the d urbervilles was to blame for this moment of madness however he knew he could not leave her now she expected him to protect her and at last clare felt nothing but love for this passionate loving wife of his he kissed her again and again and held her hand i won t leave you i ll protect you as well as i can my dearest love whatever you may or may not have done they walked on less turning her head occasionally to look at him for her he was still perfection despite his thinness and pale face he was the one man who had loved her purely and who believed in her as pure their arms around each other s waists they walked through the woods on lonely footpaths taking care not to meet anybody they did not talk much being content to be together at last where shall we go asked tess i don t know perhaps we could find a cottage to stay in tonight can you walk a long way tessy oh yes i could walk for ever with your arm around me at midday angel went to a public house and brought food and wine back to where tess was waiting in the woods for him her clothes were so fashionable that the country people would have noticed her i think we should keep walking inland away from the coasts said clare as they finished eating we can hide there for a while later on when they stop looking for us we can go to a port and get right out of the country but their plans were vague they were like two children who think only of the moment the weather was warm and they enjoyed walking together however in the afternoon they did nut find any suitable cottages to stay in and it was too cold to sleep outside they had walked about fifteen miles when they passed a large empty house in the middle of the woods all those rooms empty said tess and we have no shelter we can stay the night there said clare look there s a window open the caretaker probably airs the rooms in the daytime we can climb in nobody will know and so they did they chose a bedroom with heavy old fashioned furniture and a huge old bed they kept quiet while the caretaker came to shut the windows in the evening then the house was theirs they ate some of the food they had brought and went to bed in total darkness during the night she told him about his sleepwalking just after their wedding you should have told me at the time don t think of the past think of the present tomorrow may mean the end of our happiness but when tomorrow came it was wet and foggy it seemed that the caretaker only came on fine days so they were alone in the house they had enough food and wine and stayed there for the next five days it was the honeymoon they had never had they had no contact with people and only noticed changes in the weather neither mentioned the depressing period from their wedding day to the present they lived for the moment and were completely happy when angel suggested leaving their shelter and travelling to a port like southampton or london tess was unwilling why put an end to sweetness and happiness outside everything is confused and sad here we are quite content angel agreed inside was forgiveness and love outside was eventual punishment and she said putting her cheek against his i want you to go on loving me i m afraid you might reject me one day for what i ve done then i would rather be dead i must have been mad to kill him but i don t want to be alive when you reject me for it they stayed for one more day but the caretaker came early that fine sunny morning she wanted to open the windows in the bedrooms which she did not usually do and opened their bedroom door she saw the young couple lying in the big bed fast asleep and hurried away to tell her neighbours tess and angel woke soon after and decided to leave immediately they dared not stay any longer when they were in the woods tess turned to look at the house so much happiness in that house she whispered my life can only be a question of a few weeks why couldn t we have stayed there don t say that tess we ll go northwards and get to a port they won t find us they kept going all day and most of the night passing the cathedral city of melchester and reaching open land it was a windy cloudy night they walked on grass so as not to make any noise on the road they were alone and in darkness suddenly clare almost bumped into a great stone rising up in front of him moving forwards carefully they found other stones standing tall and black against the night sky what on earth is this place clare asked listen cried tess the wind playing on the huge stones produced a strange tune like the notes of a great harp the couple walked slowly into the middle of the great circle of stones it s stonehenge cried clare the pagan temple yes older than the centuries older than the d urbervilles let s stay here tonight angel said tess lying down on a flat stone which was still warm from the day s sunshine we d better not this place can be seen for miles in daylight i feel at home here murmured tess you used to say at talbothays that i was a pagan do you remember he bent over her and kissed her sleepy are you dearest i love it here she said i have been so happy with you and here i have only the sky above my face there is nobody in the world except us two clare thought she could rest a while here he put his coat over her and lay down beside her angel she asked presently as they listened to the wind among the stones if anything happens to me will you take care of liza lu i will she is so good and pure oh angel i wish you would marry her if you lose me as you will do soon if i lose you i lose everything she has all the best of me without my bad side and if she were yours it would almost seem as if we were not separated by death well i won t mention it again there was silence for a while angel could see the first light in the east they had not much time did they sacrifice to god here she asked no to the sun that reminds me dear tell me do you think we shall meet again after we are dead i want to know he kissed her to avoid replying oh angel that means no she almost sobbed and i so wanted to see you again so much so much not even you and i angel who love each other so much he could not answer soon she fell asleep on the stone of sacrifice the night wind died away and the stones looked black in the half light something seemed to move in the distance it was a figure approaching stonehenge clare wished they had gone on but it was too late he turned and saw another and another they were uniformed men closing in on tess with slow purposeful steps clare jumped up wildly looking round for a way to escape it s no use sir said the nearest policeman we ve surrounded the place let her finish her sleep he begged in a whisper as the men gathered round the stone he held her hand she was breathing more like a trapped animal than a woman all waited in the growing light their faces and hands silver the stones grey when the light was strong she awoke what is it angel she said sitting up have they come for me yes dearest they have that is right i am almost glad this happiness could not have lasted she stood up and went towards the waiting men i am ready she said quietly one july morning the sun shone on two figures climbing the hill leading out of the fine city of wintoncester they were young but they walked bent in sorrow one was angel clare the other tess s younger sister liza lu hand in hand with pale tear stained faces they walked in silence when they reached the top of the hill they heard the town clocks strike eight they turned quickly and looked back at the city they could see the cathedral the college and the prison very clearly a tall post was fixed to the prison tower a few minutes after eight as they watched a black flag moved slowly up the post the gods had finished playing with tess society had seen justice done her d urberville ancestors slept on in their tombs uncaring the two silent watchers dropped to the ground and stayed there without moving for a long time the flag waved in the wind as soon as they had strength they stood up joined hands again and continued slowly on their way txtba www txtba com people in

rosamund oliver daughter of a rich factory owner at ferndean manor the red room we could not go for a walk that afternoon there was such a freezing cold wind and such heavy rain that we all stayed indoors i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially in winter i used to hate coming home when it was almost dark with ice cold fingers and toes feeling miserable bccause bessie the nursemaid was always scolding me all the time i knew i was different from my cousins eliza john and georgiana reed they were taller and stronger than me and they were loved these three usually spent their time crying and quarrelling but today they were sitting quietly around their mother in the sitting room i wanted to join the family circle but mrs reed my aunt refused bessie had complainted about me no i m sorry jane until i hear from bessie or see for myself that you are really trying to behave better you cannot be treated as a good happy child like my children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane it is not polite to question me in that way if you cannot speak pleasantly be quiet i crept out of the sitting room and into the small room next door where i chose a book full of pictures from the bookcase i climbed on to the window seat and drew the curtains so that i was completely hidden i sat there for a while sometimes i looked out of the window at the grey november afternoon and saw the rain pouring down on the leafless garden but most of the time i studied the book and stared fascinated at the pictures lost in the world of imagination i forgot my sad lonely existence for a while and was happy i was only afraid that my secret hiding place might be discovered suddenly the door of the room opened john reed rushed in where are you rat he shouted he did not see me behind the curtain eliza georgy jane isn t here tell mamma she s run out into the rain what a bad animal she is how lucky i drew the curtain i thought he would never have found me because he was not very intelligent but eliza guessed at once where i was she s in the window seat john she called from the sitting room so i came out immediately as i did not want him to pull me out what do you want i asked him say what do you want master reed he answered sitting in an armchair i want you to come here john reed was fourteen and i was only ten he was large and rather fat he usually ate too much at meals which made him ill he should have been at boarding school but his mother who loved him very much had brought him home for a month or two because she thought his health was delicate john did not love his mother or his sister and he hated me he bullied and punished me not two or three times a week not once or twice a day but all the time my whole body trembled when he came near sometimes he hit me sometimes he just threatened me and i lived in terrible fear of him i had no idea about how to stop him the servants did not want to offend their young master and mrs reed could see no fault in her dear boy so i obeyed john s order and approached his armchair thinking how very ugly his face was perhaps he understood what i was thinking for he hit me hard on the face that is for your rudeness to mamma just now he said and for your wickedness in hiding and for looking at me like that you rat i was so used to his bullying that i never thought of hitting him back what were you doing behind that curtain he asked i was reading i answered show me the book i gave it to him you have no right to take our books he continued you have no money and your father left yor none you ought to beg in the streets not live here in comfort with a gentleman s family aayway all these books are mine and so is the whole house or will be in a few years time i ll teach you not to borrow my books again he lifted the heavy book and threw it hard at me it hit me and i fell cutting my head on the door i was in great pain and suddenly for the first time in my life i forgot my fear of john reed you wicked cruel boy i cried you are a bully you are as bad as a murderer what what he cried did she say that to me did you hear eliza and georgiana i ll tell mamma but first he rushed to attack me but now he was fighting with a desperate girl i really saw him as a wicked murderer i felt the blood running down my face and the pain gave me strength i fought back as hard as i could my resistance surprised him and he shouted for help his sisters ran for mrs reed who called her maid miss abbott and bessie they pulled us apart and i heard them say what a wicked girl she attacked master john mrs reed said calmly take her away to the red room and lock her in there and so i was carried upstairs arms waving and legs kicking as soon as we arrived in the red room i became quiet again and the two servants both started scolding me really miss eyre said miss abbott how could you hit him he s your young master how can he be my master i am not a servant i cried no miss eyre you are less than a servant because you do not work replied miss abbott they both looked at me as if they strongly disapproved of me you should remember miss said bessie that your aunt pays for your food and clothes and you should be grateful you have no other relations or friends all my short life i had been told this and i had no answer to it i stayed silent listening to these painful reminders and if you are angry and rude mrs reed may send you away added bessie anyway said miss abbott god will punish you jane eyre for your wicked heart pray to god and say you re sorry they left the room locking the door carefully behind them the red room was a cold silent room hardly ever used although it was one of the largest bedrooms in the house nine years ago my uncle mr reed had died in this room and since then nobody had wanted to sleep in it now that i was alone i thought bitterly of the people i lived with john reed his sisters his mother the servants they all accused me scolded me hated me why could i never please them eliza was selfish but was respected georgiana had a bad temper but she was popular with everybody because she was beautiful john was rude cruel and violent but nobody punished him i tried to make no mistakes but they called me naughty every moment of the day now that i had turned against john to protect myself everybody blamed me and so i spent that whole long afternoon in the red room asking myself why i had to suffer and why life was so unfair perhaps i would run away or starve myself to death gradually it became dark outside the rain was still beating on the windows and i could hear the wind in the trees now i was no longer angry and i began to think the reeds might be right perhaps i was wicked did i deserve to die and be buried in the churchyard like my uncle reed i could not remember him but knew he was my mother s brother who had taken me to his house when my parents both died on his death bed he had made his wife aunt reed promise to look after me like her own children i supposed she now regretted her promise a strange idea came to me i felt sure that if mr reed had lived he would have treated me kindly and now as i looked round at the dark furniture and the walls in shadow i began to fear that his ghost might come back to punish his wife for not keeping her promise he might rise from the grave in the churchyard and appear in this room i was so frightened by this thought that i hardly dared to breathe suddenly in the darkness i saw a light moving on the ceiling it may have been from a lamp outside but in my nervous state i did not think of that i felt sure it must be a ghost a visitor from another world my head was hot my heart beat fast was that the sound of wings in my ears was that something moving near me screaming wildly i rushed to the door and shook it miss abbott and bessie came running to open it miss eyre are you ill asked bessie take me out of here i screamed why what s the matter she asked i saw a light and i thought it was a ghost i cried holding tightly on to bessie s hand she s not even hurt said miss abbott in disgust she screamed just to bring us here i know all her little tricks what is all this demanded an angry voice mrs reed appeared at the door of the room abbott and bessie i think i told you to leave jane eyre in this room till i came she screamed so loudly ma am said bessie softly let go off her hands bessie was mrs reed s only answer jane eyre you need not think you can succeed in getting out of the room like this your naughty tricks will not work with me you will stay here an hour longer as a punishment for trying to deceive us oh aunt please forgive me i can t bear it i shall die if you keep me here i screamed and kicked as she held me silence control yourself she pushed me resisting wildly back into the red room and locked me in there i was in the darkness again with the silence and the ghosts i must have fainted i cannot remember anything more leaving gateshead i woke up to find the doctor lifting me very carefully into my own bed it was good to be back in my familiar bedroom with a warm fire and candle light it was also a great relief to recognize dr lloyd who mrs reed called in for her servants she always called a specialist for herself and the children he was looking after me so kindly i felt he would protect me from mrs reed he talked to me a little then gave bessie orders to take good care of me when he left i felt very lonely again but i was surprised to find that bessie did not scold me at all in fact she was so kind to me that i became brave enough to ask a question bessie what s happened am i ill yes you became ill in the red room but you ll get better don t worry miss jane she answered then she went next door to fetch another servant i could hear her whispers sarah come in here and sleep with me and that poor child tonight i daren t stay alone with her she might die she was so ill last night do you think she saw a ghost mrs reed was too hard on her i think so the two servants slept in my room while i lay awake all night trembling with fear and eyes wide open in horror imagining ghosts in every corner fortunately i suffered no serious illness as a result of my terrible experience in the red room although i shall never forget that night but the shock left me nervous and depressed for the next few days i cried all day long and although bessie tried hard to tempt me with nice things to eat or my favourite books i took no pleasure in eating or even in reading i knew i had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to when the doctor came again he seemed a little surprised to find me looking so miserable perhaps she s crying because she couldn t go out with mrs reed in the carriage this morning suggested bessie surely she s more sensible than that said the doctor smiling at me she s a big girl now i m not crying about that i hate going out in the carriage i said quickly i m crying because i m miserable oh really miss said bessie the doctor looked at me thoughtfully he had small grey intelligent eyes just then a bell rang for the servants dinner you can go bessie he said i ll stay here talking to miss jane till you come back after bessie had left he asked what really made you ill i was locked up in a room with a ghost in the dark afraid of ghosts are you he smiled of mr reed s ghost yes he died in that room you know nobody ever goes in there any more it was cruel to lock me in there alone without a candle i shall never forget it but you aren t afraid now there must be another reason why you are so sad he said looking kindly at me how could i tell him all the reasons for my unhappiness i have no father or mother brothers or sisters i began but you have a kind aunt and cousins but john reed knocked me down and my aunt locked me in the red room i cried there was a pause don t you like living at gateshead in such a beautiful house he asked i would be glad to leave it but i have nowhere else to go you have no relations apart from mrs reed i think i may have some who are very poor but i know nothing about them i answered would you like to go to school he asked finally i thought for a moment i knew very little about school but at least it would be a change the start of a new life yes i would like to go i replied in the end well well said the doctor to himself as he got up we ll see the child is delicate she ought to have a change of air i heard later from the servants that he had spoken to mrs reed about me and that she had agreed immediately to send me to school abbott said mrs reed would be glad to get rid of me in this conversation i also learned for the first time that my father had been a poor vicar when he married my mother miss jane reed of gateshead the reed family were so angry that they disinherited her i also heard that my parents both died of an illness only a year after their wedding but days and weeks passed and mrs reed still said nothing about sending me to school one day as she was scolding me i suddenly threw a question at her the words just came out without my planning to say them what would uncle reed say to you if he were alive i asked what cried mrs reed her cold grey eyes full of fear staring at me as if i were a ghost i had to continue my uncle reed is now in heaven and can see all you think and do and so can my parents they know how you hate me and are cruel to me mrs reed smacked my face and left me without a word i was scolded for an hour by bessie as the most ungrateful child in the world and indeed with so much hate in my heart i did feel wicked christmas passed by with no presents or new clothes for me every evening i watched eliza and georgiana putting on their new dresses and going out to parties sometimes bessie would come up to me in my lonely bedroom bringing a piece of cake sometimes she would tell me a story and sometimes she would kiss me goodnight when she was kind to me i thought she was the best person in the world but she did not always have time for me on the morning of the fifteenth of january bessie rushed up to my room to tell me a visitor wanted to see me who could it be i knew mrs reed would be there too and i was frightened of seeing her again when i nervously entered the breakfast room i looked up at a black column at least that was what he looked like to me he was a tall thin man dressed all in black with a cold stony face at the top of the column this is the little girl i wrote to you about said mrs reed to the stony stranger well jane eyre said the stranger heavily and are you a good child it was impossible to say yes with mrs reed sitting there so i was silent perhaps the less said about that the better mr brocklehurst said mrs reed shaking her head i m sorry to hear it he answered come here jane eyre and answer my questions where do the wicked go after death they go to hell i answered and what must you do to avoid going there he asked i thought for a moment but could not find the right answer i must keep in good health and not die i replied wrong children younger than you die all the time another question do you enjoy reading the bible yes sometimes i replied hesitating that is not enough your answers show me you have a wicked heart you must pray to god to change it if you ever want to go to heaven mr brocklehurst interrupted mrs reed i mentioned to you in my letter that this little girl has in fact a very bad character if you accept her at lowood school please make sure that the headmistress and teachers know how dishonest she is she will try to lie to them of course you see jane you cannot try your tricks on mr brocklehurst however hard i had tried to please mrs reed in the past she always thought the worst of me it was not surprising that i had come to hate her now she was accusing me in front of a stranger my hopes of starting a new life at school began to fade do not worry madam mr brocklehurst said the teachers will watch her carefully life at lowood will do her good we believe in hard work plain food simple clothes and no luxury of any kind i will send her as soon as possible then mr brocklehurst i hope she will be taught according to her low position in life indeed she will madam i hope she will be grateful for this opportunity to improve her character little girl read this book it tells the story of the sudden death of a young girl who was a liar read and pray after mr brocklehurst had given me the book and left i felt i had to speak anger was boiling up inside me i walked up to mrs reed and looked straight into her eyes i do not deceive people if i told lies i would say i loved you but i don t i hate you i will never call you aunt again as long as i live if anyone asks how you treated me i will tell them the truth that you were very cruel to me people think you are a good woman but you are lying to them even before i had finished i began to experience a great feeling of freedom and relief at last i had said what i felt mrs reed looked frightened and unhappy jane i want to be your friend you don t know what you re saying you are too excited go to your room and lie down i won t lie down i m quite calm send me to school soon mrs reed i hate living here i will indeed send her soon murmured mrs reed to herself my first impressions of school mrs reed arranged for me to leave on the nineteenth of january i had to get up very early to catch the coach but bessie helped me to get ready will you say goodbye to mrs reed jane she asked no she said i shouldn t disturb her so early anyway i don t want to say anything to her she s always hated me oh miss jane don t say that goodbye to gateshead i shouted wildly as we walked together out of the front door to wait for the coach in the road it arrived pulled by four horses and full of passengers the coachman took my luggage and called me to hurry up bessie kissed me for the last time as i held tightly to her she shouted up to the coachman make sure you take care of her fifty miles is a long way for a young child to go alone i will he answered the door was closed and the coach rolled off what a strange feeling to be leaving gateshead my home for the whole of my childhood although i was sad to say goodbye to bessie i was both excited and nervous about the new place i would see and the new people i would meet i do not remember much about the journey except that it seemed far too long we stopped for lunch to change the horses then in the afternoon i realized we were driving through countryside i slept for a short time but was woken when the coach stopped the door opened and a servant called in is there a little girl called jane eyre here yes i answered and was helped out of the coach with my luggage tired and confused after the journey i followed the servant into a large building where she left me in a sitting room in came a tall lady with dark hair and eyes and a large pale forehead i discovered that she was miss temple the headmistress of lowood school she looked at me carefully you are very young to be sent alone you look tired are you she asked putting her hand kindly on my shoulder a little ma am i replied how old are you and what is your name i m jane eyre ma am and i m ten years old well i hope you will be a good child at school she said touching my cheek gently with her finger i was taken by a teacher miss miller through the silent corridors of the large school to the long wide schoolroom there about eighty girls aged from nine to twenty sat doing their homework i sat on a bench near the door with my slate put away the lesson books and fetch the supper trays called miss miller four tall girls removed all the books then went out and returned with trays which were handed round each child could have a drink of water out of the shared cup and could take a small piece of biscuit then we all went quietly upstairs to the long crowded bedroom where two children shared every bed i had to share miss miller s but i was so tired that i fell asleep immediately in the morning the ringing of a bell woke me although it was still dark i got dressed quickly in the bitter cold of the room and washed when i could there was only one basin for six girls when the bell rang again we all went downstairs two by two and silently entered the cold badly lit schoolroom for prayers as the bell rang a third time to indicate the beginning of lessons the girls moved into four groups around four tables and the teachers came into the room to start the bible class i was put in the bottom class how glad i was when it was time for breakfast i had hardly eaten anything the day before but the only food served to us was porridge which was burnt it was so disgusting that we could not eat it so we left the dining room with empty stomachs after breakfast came the one happy moment of the day when the pupils could play and talk freely we all complained bitterly about the uneatable breakfast lessons started again at nine o clock and finished at twelve when miss temple stood up to speak to the whole school girls this morning you had a breakfast which you couldn t eat you must be hungry so i have ordered a lunch of bread and cheese for you all the teachers looked at her in surprise don t worry i take responsibility for it she told them we were delighted and all rushed out into the garden to eat our lunch nobody had taken any notice of me so far but i did not mind that i stood alone outside watching some of the stronger girls playing trying to forget the bitter cold and thinking about my life gateshead and the reed family seemed a long way away i was not yet used to school life and what sort of future could i look forward to as i wondered i saw a girl near me reading a book i felt brave enough to speak to her since i too liked reading is your book interesting what is it about i asked well i like it she said after a pause looking at me here have a look at it i glanced quickly at it but found it too difficult to understand so i gave it back what sort of school is this i asked it s called lowood school it s a charity school we re all charity children you see i expect your parents are dead aren t they all the girls here have lost either one or both parents don t we pay anything is the school free i asked we pay or our relations pay a year for each of us that isn t enough so some kind ladies and gentlemen in london pay the rest that s why it s called a charity school who is mr brocklehurst was my next question his mother built this part of the school he s the manager and looks after all financial matters he lives in a large house near here i did not see her again until during the afternoon lessons when i noticed that she had been sent to stand alone in the middle of the schoolroom i could not imagine what she had done to deserve such a punishment but she did not look ashamed or unhappy she was lost in thought and did not seem to notice that everyone was looking at her if that happened to me i thought i would be so embarrassed after lessons we had a small cup of coffee and half a piece of brown bread then half an hour s play then homework finally after the evening biscuit and drink of water we said prayers and went to bed that was my first day at lowood making a friend the next morning we got up in the dark as before but the water was frozen so we could not wash it was freezing cold in all the rooms this time the porridge was not burnt but i still felt hungry as the quantity was so small i stayed in the bottom class but noticed the girl that i had been talking to was in another class her surname seemed to be burns teachers called girls by their surnames in this school her class were studying history and her teacher miss scatcherd appeared constantly annoyed by her burns hold your head up can t you burns don t stand like that the history questions asked by miss scatcherd sounded very difficult but burns knew all the answers i kept expecting the teacher to praise her but instead she suddenly cried out you dirty girl you haven t washed your hands this morning i was surprised that burns did not explain that none of us could wash our faces or hands because the water had been frozen miss scatcherd gave an order burns left the room and returned carrying a stick the teacher took it and hit burns several times with it the girl did not cry or change her expression wicked girl said miss scatcherd nothing will change your dirty habits later that day during the play hour i found burns alone by the fireside reading the same book as before and i started talking to her what is the rest of your name i asked helen she replied do you want to leave lowood no why should i i was sent to school here so i must learn as much as i can but miss scatcherd is so cruel to you i burst out cruel not at all she is strict and she sees my faults if i were you i d hate her i cried if she hit me with a stick i d seize it and break it under her nose i don t think you would answered helen quietly and if you did mr brocklehurst would send you away from school and your relations would be upset anyway the bible tells us to do good even if other people hurt us sometimes you have to put up with some hard things in life i could not understand her ideas but i had a feeling she might be right i looked at her in wonder you say you have faults helen what are they to me you seem very good you are wrong she answered i m untidy and careless and i forget the rules i read when i should be doing my homework you see miss scatcherd is right to scold me is miss temple as strict as that i asked a soft smile passed over helen s normally serious face miss temple is full of goodness she gently tells me of my mistakes and praises me if i do well but even with her help i don t concentrate properly in class i just dream away the time and then i can t answer the teacher s questions but today in history you knew all the answers i said i just happened to be interested that s all she replied i expect you are always interested in miss temple s lessons because you like her and she is good to you i m like that i love those who love me and i hate those who punish me unfairly you should read the bible and do what christ says people who believe in god should love their enemies said helen then i should love mrs reed and her son john which is impossible i cried helen asked me to explain what i meant and listened carefully to the long story of what i had suffered at gateshead well i asked impatiently at the end isn t mrs reed a bad woman don t you agree with me it s true she has been unkind to you because she dislikes your faults as miss scatcherd dislikes mine but look how bitterly you remember every angry word wouldn t you be happier if you tried to forget her scolding life is too short to continue hating anyone for a long time we all have faults but the time will come soon when we die when our wickedness will pass away with our bodies leaving only the pure flame of the spirit that s why i never think of revenge i never consider life unfair i live in calm looking forward to the end for a moment we both stayed silent then one of the big girls came up calling helen burns go and put away your work and tidy your drawer immediately or i ll tell miss scatcherd helen sighed and getting up silently obeyed mr brocklehurst s visit and its results it was difficult for me to get used to the school rules at lowood and to the hard physical conditions in january february and march there was deep snow but we still had to spend an hour outside every day we had no boots or gloves and my hands and feet ached badly we were growing children and needed more food than was provided sometimes the big girls bullied us little ones and made us hand over our teatime bread or evening biscuit one afternoon when i had been at lowood for three weeks a visitor arrived all the teachers and pupils stood respectfully as he entered the schoolroom i looked up there next to miss temple stood the same black column which had frowned on me in the breakfast room at gateshead i had been afraid he would come i remembered only too well mrs reed s description of my character and the promise he had given her to warn teachers at lowood about my wickedness now they would consider me a bad child for ever at first mr brocklehurst spoke in a murmur to miss temple i could just hear because i was in the front of the class tell the housekeeper she must count the needles and only give out one at a time to the girls they lose them so easily and miss temple please make sure the girls stockings are mended more carefully some of them have a lot of holes i shall follow your instructions sir said miss temple and another thing which surprises me i find that a lunch of bread and cheese has been served to the girls recently why is this there is nothing about it in the rules who is responsible i myself sir answered miss temple the breakfast was so badly cooked that the girls couldn t possibly eat it so they were hungry madam listen to me for a moment you know that i am trying to bring up these girls to be strong patient and unselfish if some little luxury is not available do not replace it with something else but tell them to be brave and suffer like christ himself remember what the bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by the word of god madam when you put bread into these children s mouths you feed their bodies but you starve their souls miss temple did not reply she looked straight in front of hef and her face was as cold and hard as marble mr brocklehurst on the other hand now looked round at the girls and almost jumped in surprise who what is that girl with red hair with curls madam with curls everywhere that is julia severn said miss temple quietly her hair curls naturally you see naturally yes but it is god we obey not nature miss temple that girl s hair must be cut off i have said again and again that hair must be arranged modestly and plainly i see other girls here with too much hair yes i shall send someone tomorrow to cut all the girls hair mr brocklehurst began miss temple no miss temple i insist to please god these girls must have short straight hair and plain simple clothes he was interrupted by the arrival of three ladies who had unfortunately not heard his comments on dress and hair they all wore the most expensive clothes and had beautiful long curly hair i heard miss temple greet them as the wife and daughters of mr brocklehurst i had hoped to hide my face behind my slate while mr brocklehurst was talking so that he would not recognize me but suddenly the slate fell from my hand and broke in two on the hard floor i knew only too well what would happen next a careless girl said mr brocklehurst quietly almost to himself the new girl i see i must not forget to say something to the whole school about her and then to me aloud come here child i was too frightened to move but two big girls pushed me towards him miss temple whispered kindly in my ear don t be afraid jane i saw it was an accident her kindness touched me but i knew that soon she would hear the lies about me and then she would hate me put the child on that chair said mr brocklehurst someone lifted me up on to a high chair so that i was close to his nose frightened and shaking i felt everyone s eyes on me you see this girl began the black marble column she is young she books like an ordinary child nothing about her tells you she is evil but she is all wickedness children don t talk to her stay away from her teachers watch her punish her body to save her soul if indeed she has a soul because this child i can hardly say it this child is a liar how shocking said the two brocklehurst daughters each wiping a tear or two from their eyes i learned this fact continued the great man from mrs reed the kind lady who took care of her after her parents death and brought her up as a member of the family in the end mrs reed was so afraid of this child s evil influence on her own children that she had to send her here teachers watch her carefully the brocklehurst farmily stood up and moved slowly out of the schoolroom at the door my judge turned and said she must stand half an hour longer on that chair and nobody may speak to her for the rest of the day so there i was high up on the chair publicly displayed as an ugly example of evil feelings of shame and anger boiled up inside me but just as i felt i could not bear it any longer helen burns walked past me and lifted her eyes to mine her look calmed me what a smile she had it was an intelligent brave smile lighting up her thin face and her tired grey eyes when all the girls left the schoolroom at five o clock i climbed down from the chair and sat on the floor i no longer felt strong or calm and i began to cry bitterly i had wanted so much to make friends at lowood to be good to deserve praise now nobody would believe me or perhaps even speak to me could i ever start a new life after this never i cried i wish i were dead just then helen arrived bringing my coffee and bread i was too upset to eat or drink but she sat with me for some time talking gently to me wiping away my tears and helping me to recover when miss temple came to look for me she found us sitting quietly together gome up to my room both of you she said we went to her warm comfortable room upstairs now tell me the truth jane she said you have been accused and you must have the chance to defend yourself and so i told her the whole story of my lonely childhood with the reed family and of my terrible experience in the red room i know dr lloyd who saw you when you were ill she said i ll write to him and see if he agrees with what you say if he does i shall publicly tell the school you are not a liar i believe you now jane and she kissed me she turned to helen how are you tonight helen have you coughed a lot today not very much ma am and the pain in your chest it s a little better i think miss temple examined helen carefully and sighed a little then she gave us some tea and toast for a while i felt i was in heaven eating and drinking in the warm pretty room with kind miss temple and helen but when we reached our bedroom miss scatcherd was checking the drawers burns she said yours is far too untidy tomorrow all day you will wear a notice on your forehead saying un tidy helen said miss scatcherd was quite right and wore the notice all the next day but i was furious and at the end of the afternoon tore it off her head and threw it in the fire when miss temple received a letter from dr lloyd agreeing that what i had said was true she told the whole school that i had been wrongly accused and was not a liar from that moment i felt i was accepted and set to work to learn as much as i could and make as many friends as possible learning to like school life at lowood no longer seemed so hard as spring approached we enjoyed walking and playing in the surrounding countryside but with fog lying constantly in the valley it was not a healthy place for a school and by may more than half the girls were seriously ill with typhus fever as a result of poor food and bad living conditions many girls died while there was fear and death inside the school the sun shone on the flowers outside and on the flowing streams in the valleys so i and the few who had escaped illness enjoyed the beautiful summer weather with no lessons or discipline at all helen burns could not come walking with me because she was ill not with typhus but with tuberculosis at first i had thought she would recover but when i learned her illness was serious i decided to visit her at night for what might be the last time i found her lying in bed looking pale and weak you ve come to say goodbye she whispered coughing you are just in time i m going soon where helen are you going home i asked yes to my long home my last home no no helen i was crying at the thought of losing her jane your feet are cold lie down with me and cover them with my blanket i did so i am happy jane she continued you mustn t cry by dying young i ll avoid suffering i am going to heaven does heaven really exist i asked yes i m sure of it i m sure our souls go there when we die she answered firmly will i see you again helen when i die yes you will go to heaven too jane i could not quite believe that heaven existed and i held tightly to helen i did not want to let her go we kissed goodnight and fell asleep in the morning miss temple found me asleep with helen burns dead in my arms she was buried in the local churchyard gradually the typhus fever left lowood but the number of deaths made the public aware of the poor conditions in which the pupils lived money was raised to build a new school in a better position many improvements were made and mr brocklehurst lost his position as manager so it became a really useful place of education i stayed for eight years for the last two as a teacher i was busy and happy all that time relying greatly on the help and encouragement of my dear friend miss temple but when she married and movd to a distant part of the country i decided it was the moment for me to change my life too i realized i had never known any other world apart from lowood or gateshead suddenly i wanted freedom or at least a new master to serve so i advertised in a newspaper for a job as a governess when i received an answer from a mrs fairfax who wanted a governess for a girl under ten years old i accepted with the permission of the new headmistress of lowood thornfield and mr rochester thornfield hall was a large gentleman s house in the country near a town called millcote there after my sixteen hour journed i was welcomed by mrs fairfax she was a little old lady dressed in black who seemed glad to have someone else to talk to apart from the servants although the house was dark and frightening with its big rooms full of heavy furniture i was excited at being in a new place and looked forward to my new life there working for kind mrs fairfax but i was surprised to discover on my first full day at thornfield that mrs fairfax was not in fact the owner as i had assumed but the housekeeper and that my new master was a mr rochester who was often away from home my pupil was a girl called ade e seven or eight years old who was born in france and could hardly speak english luckily i had learnt french very well at lowtood and had no difficulty in communicating with young ad le a pretty cheerful child it appeared that mr rochester who had known ad le and her mother very well had brought ad le back to england to live with him after her mother had died i taught her for several hours every day in the library although it was not easy to make her concentrate on anything for long as she was clearly not used to the discipline of lessons one day i took the opportunity of asking mrs fairfax a few questions about mr rochester as i was curious about him and the little housekeeper seemed happy to talk is he liked by most people was my first question oh yes his family have always been respected here they ve owned the land round here for years she replied but do you like him what is his character like i have always liked him and i think he s a fair master to his servants he s a little peculiar perhaps he s travelled a lot you know i expect he s clever but i can t tell really what do you mean peculiar i asked interested it s not easy to describe you re never sure whether he s serious or joking you don t really understand him at least i don t but that doesn t matter he s a very good master i could get no further information from mrs fairfax about mr rochester but instead she offered to show me round the whole house we went through many large impressive rooms finally reaching the top floor where there was a narrow corridor with several small black doors all shut i stopped to look at them and thought for a moment they looked like prison doors hiding evil secrets no sooner had i turned away to go downstairs than i heard a strange ghostly laugh mrs fairfax i called out as the housekeeper was already on her way downstairs did you hear that laugh who is it it may be grace poole she answered calmly she is paid to help the housemaid in her work and always sews in one of those rooms i heard the laugh again it did not sound human to me grace called mrs fairfax i did not expect anyone to answer but in fact a door opened and a middle aged woman appeared she looked too plain and sensible to be a ghost too much noise grace said mrs fairfax remember your instructions grace nodded and went back into the roon several times in the next few months i went up to the top floor again where i could look out of the high windows in the roof to see the surrounding countryside and be alone with my thoughts i was very happy teaching pretty little ad le in the daytime and talking to kind old mrs fairfax in the evening but i felt that something was missing from my life i had dreams of a greater and better life and above all i wanted to do more people are not always satisfied with a quiet life and women as well as men need action while on the top floor i often heard grace poole s strange laugh and sometimes i saw her too she used to go silently in and out of the room with a plate of food or a glass of beer one day in january i had a free afternoon as ad le wsa ill so i decided to walk to hay a village two miles away to post a letter for the housekeeper it was a bright frosty day and i was enjoying the fresh air and the exercise stopping on the lonely road i watched the sun go down in the trees behind thornfield and then in the silence i heard a horse approaching suddenly there was a crash as the horse slipped and fell on the ice bringing down its rider i ran to see if i could help the traveller who was swearing furiously as he pulled himself free of his horse are you hurt sir can i do anything i asked just stand back he growled as he lifted himself painfully to his feet obviously his leg hurt him and he sat down quickly if you need help sir i can fetch someone either from thornfield hall or from hay i offered thank you but i don t need anyone i haven t broken any bones he replied crossly i could see him clearly in the moonlight he was of medium height with wide shoulders and a strong chest he had a dark face with angry looking eyes and was about thirty five if he had been a young attractive gentleman i would have been too shy to offer help but as he was not handsome and even quite rough i felt i wanted to help him i can t leave you sir so late on this lonely road till i see you are fit enough to get on your horse i insisted he looked at me for the first time when i said this i think you ought to be at home yourself he answered do you live near here in that house over therd i said and i m not at all afraid of being out at night i m just going to hay to post a letter and i ll be happy to take a message for you you live in in that house he asked surprised pointing to thornfield hall which was lit up in the moonlight yes sir i replied whose house is it he asked mr rochester s do you know mr rochester was his next question no i ve never seen him i answered you aren t a servant at thornfield hall of course you must be he hesitated looking at my plain black dress he seemed puzzled to know who i was so i helped him i am the governess ah the governess i had forgptten he tried to get up but his leg was still hurting him badly i don t want you to fetch help but you could help me yourself if you like of course sir i said and so he leaned his weight on my shoulder and i helped him wald to his horse in a moment he had jumped on to the horse s back thank you now take your letter to hay then hurry home he called as he rode off into the distance i walked on glad to have helped someone to have done something active for once in my mind i saw that dark strong face and i still felt excited by our meeting even when i arrived back at thornfield i did not go in for a while i did not want to go into the dark house where i would spend the evening quietly with old mrs fairfax so i stayed outside staring up at the moon and the stars with a beating heart wishing and dreaming of a different more exciting life when i entered the servants told me that mr rochester had arrived and that he had hurt his leg when his horse slipped on ice on the road to hay getting to know mr rochester thornfield hall became quite busy the next day now that the master had returned people kept coming to visit him on business i enjoyed the new cheerful atmosphere but i could not make adele concentrate on her lessons because she was constantly talking about the presents mr rochester had promised to bring her that evening we were invited to have tea with him i immediately recognized the traveller i had helped with his dark hair and skin his square forehead and his stern look his leg was supported on a chair but he made no effort to greet me when i entered in fact he neither spoke nor moved have you brought a present for miss eyre with you as well adele asked him a present who wants a present he said angrily did you expect a present miss eyer do you like presents i haven t much experience of them sir i answered anyway i have no right to expect a present as i haven t done anything to deserve one don t be so modest i ve been talking to adele she s not very clever but you ve taught her well sir that is my present that s what a teacher wants most praise of her pupil s progress mr rochester drank his tea in silence after tea he called me closer to the fire while ad le played with mrs fairfax where were you before you came here he asked i was at lowood school sir for eight years ah yes a charity school eight years i m surprised you lasted so long in such a place there is something like magic in your face when i met you on the road to hay last night i almost thought you had put a spell on my horse i still wonder if you did what about your parents they re dead i don t remember them and your relations i have none who recommended you to come here i advertised and mrs fairfax answered the advertise ment yes said the old housekeeper and i thank god she did she s a good teacher for ad le and a kind friend to me don t try to give her a good character mrs fairfax said mr rochester sternly she and her magic made my horse slip on the ice last night mrs fairfax looked puzzled and clearly did not understand miss eyre continued mr rochester how old were you when you started at lowood about ten and you stayed there eight years so you are now eighteen i nodded i would never have been able to guess your age he went on now what did you learn there can you play the piano a little of course that s what all young women say go and play a tune on the piano in the library i did as he asked that s enough he called after a few minutes yes you do indeed play a ittle just like any schoolgirl better than some perhaps now bring me your sketches i fetched them from my room having looked carefully at them he chose three these are interesting he said you have only expressed the shadow of your ideas because you aren t good enough at drawing or painting but the ideas where did they come from who taught you to draw wind and space and feeling but put them away now miss eyre do you realize it s nine o clock ad le should be in bed by now good night to you all mr rochester s mood had suddenly changed and he clearly wished to be alone later tha evening i talked to mrs fairfax you said mr rochester was a little peculiar i said well what do you think miss eyre i think he is very peculiar and quite rude he may seem like that to a stranger i m so used to him that i never notice it and he has had family troubles you know but he has no family i answered not now that s true but he did have an older brother who died nine years ago nine years is a long time surely he has recovered from losing his brother by now well there was a lot of bad feeling in the family the father was very fond of money and wanted to keep the family property together so the elder brother inherited most of it i don t know what happened but i do know mr edward that s the master quarrelled with his family that s why he s travelled so much when his brother died he inherited thornfield but i m not surprised he doesn t come here often why should he stay away i asked surprised perhaps he thinks it s a sad place i really don t know it was clear that mrs fairfax would not tell me any more one evening a few days later i was invited to talk to mr rochester after dinner at the far end of the room ad le was delightedly telling mrs fairfax about the presents she had received mr rochester called me closer to the fire i don t like the conversation of children or old ladies he murmured to me but they are entertaining each other at the moment so i can amuse myself tonight he did not look so stern and there was a softness in his fine dark eyes as i was looking at him he suddenly turned and caught my look do you think i m handsome miss eyre he asked normally i would have taken time to think and said something polite but somehow i answered at once no sir ah you really are unusual you are a quiet serious little person but you can be almost rude sir i m sorry i should have said that beauty doesn t matter or something like that no you shouldn t i see you criticize my appearance and then you stab me in the back all right tell me what is wrong with my appearance mr rochester i didn t intend to criticize you well now you can look at my head do you think i am intelligent he pointed to his huge square forehead i do sir is it rude to ask if you are also good stabbing me again just because i said i didn t like talking to old ladies and children well young lady i wanted to be good when i was younger but life has been a struggle for me and i ve become as hard and tough as a rubber ball i only have a little goodness left inside he was speaking rather excitedly and i thought perhaps he had been drinking miss eyre you look puzzled tonight i want conversation it s your turn speak i said nothing but smiled coldly i m sorry if i m rude miss eyre but i m twenty years older and more experienced than you don t you think i have the right to command you no sir not just because you re older and more experienced than me you would have the right only if you d made good use of your experience of life i don t accept that as i ve made very bad use of my experience but will you agree to obey my orders anyway i thought he is peculiar he s forgotten that he s paying me a year to obey his orders and i said not many masters bother to ask if their servants are offended by their orders of course i d forgotten that i pay you a salary so will you agree because of the salary no sir not because of that but because you forgot about it and because you care whether a servant of yours is comfortable or not i gladly agree you have honesty and feeling there are not many girls like you but perhaps i go too fast perhaps you have awful faults to counterbalance your few good points and perhaps you have too i thought he seemed to read my mind and said quickly yes you re right i have plenty of faults i went the wrong way when i was twenty one and have never found the right path again i might have been very different i might have been as good as you and perhaps wiser i am not a bad man take my word for it but i have done wrong it wasn t my character but circumstances which were to blame why do i tell you all this because you re the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to because you re sympathetic and give them hope do you think so sir i do you see when life was difficult i became desperate and now all i have is regret asking forgiveness might cure it sir no it won t what i really should do is change my character and i still could but it s difficult and if i can t have happiness i want pleasure even if it s wrong pleasure may taste bitter sir how do you know a pure young thing like you you have no experience of life and its problems but i will try to lead a better life i stood up the conversation was becoming hard to follow i must put ad le to bed now i said don t be afraid of me miss eyre you don t relax or laugh very much perhaps because of the effect lowood school has had on you but in time you will be more natural with me and laugh and speak freely you re like a restless bird in a cage when you get out of the cage you ll fly very high good night mr rochester s past soon i discovered what mr rochester meant when he said he had done wrong one afternoon while walking in the gardens of thornfield he told me the story of his love affair in paris with a french dancer geline yes miss eyre i was young and foolish then i was so in love with her that i rented a house and hired servants for her i gave her a carriage and jewels in fact i threw away a fortune on her just like any fool in love one evening i visited her but found she was out so i waited on her balcony smoking a cigar i heard her carriage arriving imagine my horror at seeing her step out followed by a man you re so young you ve never felt love or jealousy have you miss eyre you are floating along a quiet river now you don t see the water boiling at the foot of the great rocks but one day you ll come to a point in life s stream where the wild force of the waves may destroy you where the noisy rushing water may drown you i am calm enough now calm enough to like living here at thornfield i like it because it s old and grey and dark and yet i hate he did not finish what he was saying staring angrily up at the windows on the top floor of his house it was a look of disgust pain and shame i could not understand what he meant and wanted to hear more about celine so i encouraged him to finish the story what happened when she entered the house sir oh i d forgotten c line by the way it s strange my telling you all this but i know my secret s safe with you and i know too that it can t have an evil influence on you your mind s too strong for that yes i listened to her conversation with her lover an elegant young fool and i knew i was no longer in love with her so i walked into the room told her our relationship was over and challenged her lover to fight me next day i shot him in the arm during our fight thought that was the end of the whole thing and left france but a few months before c line had had a baby girl ad le and she claimed that ad le was my child she may be although i doubt it so when a few years later c line abandoned ad le and ran away to italy with a singer i went to paris and brought ad le back to grow up in england i felt proud that mr rochester had trusted me with the story of his past life i thought a lot about his character and although i was aware of his faults i also saw his goodness and kindness to me from now on my happiest moments were spent with him i could not have imagined a better companion one night i was woken by a slight noise i felt sure someone was outside my bedroom door as i hurried to lock it i called who s there there was a strange inhuman sound then i heard a door shut upstairs on the top floor was that grace poole i wondered trembling my curiosity made me open the door and i found the corridor full of smoke i saw it was coming from mr rochester s door which was slightly open i completely forgot my fears and rushed into his room he lay fast asleep surrounded by flames and smoke even his sheets were on fire wake up wake up i shouted desperately throwing water over him to put out the flames not until the fire was almost out did he wake up swearing to find himself so wet is there a flood he cried no sir i answered but there s been a fire jane eyre is it you and your magic he asked have you put a spell on me again did you intend to drown me this time please get up sir someone has plotted to kill you and i explained what i had heard and how i had put out the fire he looked very serious and thought for a few seconds shall i fetch mrs fairfax sir or the servants i asked no why bother them just stay here for a moment i m going up to the top floor don t call anyone i ll be back soon i waited cold and tired in his room for what seemed a very long time then i saw the light of his candle approaching through the darkness and he appeared looking pale and depressed did you see anything when you opened your bedroom door he asked glancing sharply at me no sir only a candle on the floor but you heard a strange laugh did you say yes i ve heard it before grace poole laughs like that that s it it must have been grace poole you ve guessed it i shall consider what to do about it but meanwhile i m glad you re the only person who knows anything about all this say nothing to anybody else and now go back to your own room good night then sir i said moving towards the door what are you leaving me already he said seeming surprised although he had just told me to go and so coldly you said i should go sir but not without saying goodbye not without a kind word or two why you ve saved my life i hate being in debt to anyone but with you it s different jane i m happy to owe you my life his voice was trembling as he took both my hands in his i knew when i first saw you that you would do me good i saw it in you eyes when i met you i was right to like your smile and the magic in your face there was energy in his voice and a strange light in his eyes i m glad i happened to be awake i said but i must go now i m cold i knew i could not control my feelings much longer and i needed time to think but he still held on to my hands then i thought of a way of escaping i think i hear the servants moving sir i said well leave me he said and let me go that night or what was left of it i could not sleep my mind was full of confusing pictures and disturbed emotions the mystery of grace poole a fter this sleepless night i was eager to see mr rochester in the morning but there was no sign of him he had obviously told the servants that he had accidentally set fire to his room by knocking over a lighted candle as i passed his bedroom i saw grace poole sitting inside calmly mending the curtains she certainly did not look desperate or mad enough to have tried to murder her master but i decided to investigate good morning grace i said entering the room tell me what happened last night the servants are talking about it good morning miss she replied looking up innocently well master was reading in bed and fell asleep so he must have knocked the candle over it set fire to the sheets but luckily he managed to put the flames out with some water how strange i said quietly didn t anybody hear what was happening at this she seemed to examine me carefully mrs fairfax and you sleep nearest this room miss mrs fairfax is a heavy sleeper like most old people and didn t hear anything but you rs young miss perhaps you heard a noise i did i whispered i m sure i heard a strange laugh she went on sewing calmly i don t think master would have laughed when he was in such danger she said you must have been dreaming no i wasn t dreaming i replied sharply you didn t think of opening your door and looking out into the corridor she asked i suddenly realized that if she suspected i knew of her guilt she might attack me no in fact i locked my door i answered and i shall lock it every night from now on that s wise of you miss we might have burglars at thornfield one day you never know i was amazed by her self control and could not understand why mr rochester had not asked the police to arrest her or at least dismissed her from his service why had he asked me to keep the attack a secret how could such a proud gentleman be so much in the power of one of his servants that he could not even punish her for trying to kill him did she know a terrible secret fron his past which she had threatened to tell could he ever have been in love with her no i thought he could never love anyone as plain and coarse as she is but then i m not beautiful either and i sometimes think he loves me last night his words his look his voice and my cheeks were red as i thought of those precious moments i was now even more impatient to see mr rochester but when i was having tea with mrs fairfax in the afternoon the first thing she said was it s fine weather for the master s journey journey i cried i didn t know he d gone anywhere oh yes he went off just after breakfast to visit a family in a big house about sixteen miles away i know they ve invited a lot of guests who ll be staying in the house mr rochester is always very popular with the ladies at these parties so he may not come back for a week or so who are the ladies at this house party three sisters very elegant young ladies and their friends blanche and mary ingram but blanche is the most beautiful of all i saw her when she came to a christmas party at thornfield six or seven years ago what does she look like she was eighteen then a lovely girl with beautiful skin long curling black hair and fine black eyes which shone as brightly as her jewels she looked like a queen all the gentlemen admired her not only for her beauty but also for her musical skills when she and mr rochester sang together it was a delight to hear mr rochester i didn t know he could sing oh yes he has a very fine voice and then she played the piano later the master said she played extremely well and this beautiful lady isn t married yet no i don t think she or her sister has much money but i m surprised some rich gentleman hasn t fallen in love with her mr rochester for example he s rich isn t he oh yes but you see there s a considerable difference in age he s nearly forty and she s only twenty five well marriages like that happen every day de you think but i was interrupted by adele who came to join us and the subject was changed that night in my room i was stern with myself you jane eyre i accused my reflection in the mirror you are the biggest fool in the world how could you imagine that a gentleman of family and wealth would love you a plain little governess just look at yourself and i decided that next day i would draw an honest sketch of myself and then one of blanche ingram painting the most lovely face i could imagine according to mrs fairfax s description in the future if ever my old feelings about mr rochester began to return i would only have to glance at the two pictures to see the great difference between us and in this way common sense would destroy my foolish dreams the thornfield house party t wo disappointing weeks passed before we heard from mr rochester again during this time i tried hard to forget my feeling for him i reminded myself that he paid me to teach ad le nothing more and that no other relationship could exist between us when his letter finally came mrs fairfax announced with great excitement that he was planning a house party at thornfield he was going to return in three days time and had invited a large number of ladies and gentlemen to stay for several days we all worked extremely hard in the next few days cleaning all the rooms and preparing the food the only person in the house who did not appear excited was grace poole who stayed in her room upstairs coming down once a day for food and drink none of the servants seemed at all curious about her but i once heard two of the maids talking and i listened when i caught her name does grace poole earn a lot then asked one oh yes live times what you and i earn answered the other but she s good at the work i expect said the first ah she understands what she has to do that s true answered the second and not everyone would want to do her job not even for all that money quite right i wonder whether the master suddenly they saw me and broke off their conversation doesn t she know i heard one of them whisper no said the other and they were silent so i realized there was a secret at thornfield which nobody wanted to tell me at last the great day came everything was ready for the master and his guests adele and i watched from an upstairs window as the carriages arrived in front rode mr rochester on his black horse and with him rode a beautiful lady her black curls streaming in the wind blanche ingram i thought we listened to the laughing and talking in the hall as the guests were welcomed by their host and his house keeper from a dark corner of the stairs we admired the ladies as they went up to their rooms and then again as they descended to dinner in their elegant evening dresses ad le was hoping mr rochester would call her down to meet the guests but in the end she was so tired with all the excitement that she and i both went to bed early next morning after breakfast the whole group went out for the day again i saw mr rochester and blanche ingram riding together i pointed this out to mrs fairfax you see mr rochester clearly prefers her to any of the other ladies yes he does seem to admire her admitted the housekeeper and she admires him notice how she looks at him but i haven t really seen her face yet i d like to you ll see her tonight answered mrs fairfax i mentioned to the master that ad le wanted to be introduced to the ladies and he asked you to bring her down to meet them this evening well i ll go if he wants me to but i don t like meeting strangers i m not used to it i understand how you feel said the old lady kindly but the guests won t notice you much and you can easily escape after a short time so ad le and i dressed in our best were waiting as the ladies came into the sitting room after dinner i was most impressed by the beauty and elegance of all of them but was especially fascinated by the ingram family lady ingram although between forty and fifty was still a fine woman her hair still looked black by candle light at least and her teeth still seemed perfect but she had fierce proud eyes that reminded me of aunt reed s and a hard powerful voice her daughter mary was rather quiet but her other daughter blanche was very different as soon as the gentlemen came into the room and coffee was served she became the centre of attention she played the piano excellently she sang sweetly she discussed intelligently and all the time her flashing eyes rich black curls and fine figure attracted glances from every gentleman in the room but i was looking for someone else the last time i had seen him on the night of the fire he had held my hands told me i had saved his life and looked at me as if he loved me how close we had been then but now he entered the room without even looking at me and took a seat with the ladies i could not stop looking at him rather like a thirsty man who knows the water is poisoned but cannot resist drinking i had never intended to love him i had tried hard to destroy all feelings of love for him but now that i saw him again i could not stop myself loving him i compared him to the other gentlemen present they were all fine handsome men but they did not have his power his character his strength or indeed his deep laugh or his gentle smile i felt that he and i were the same sort of person that there was something in my brain and heart in my blood and bone that connected me to him for ever and although i knew i must hide my feelings must never allow myself to hope i also knew that while there was breath in my body i would always love him just then i heard blanche ingram say to him mr rochester you should have sent that little girl ad le is that her name to school but i see you have a governess for her i saw a strange little person with her just now has she gone oh no there she is in the window seat it s very foolish of you you know governesses aren t worth their salary are they mamma my dear don t mention governesses to me cried lady ingram holding a white hand to her forehead how i have suffered with them one of the older ladies whispered to her pointing in my direction oh i don t care if she hears me said lady ingram all governesses are useless they never teach children anything what fun we used to have playing tricks on them didn t we mary laughed blanche but governesses are boring let s change the subject mr rochester will you sing with me with pleasure he answered bowing and the group moved towards the piano this was the moment for me to escape but i had only just left the sitting room and reached the hall when mr rochester appeared through another door come back you re leaving too early he said to me i m tired sir he looked at me for a minute and a little depressed why tell me nothing it s nothing sir l m not depressed but i think you are you re almost crying but i haven t got time now to discover the reason well tonight you may leave early but i want to see you with my guests every evening good night my he stopped bit his lip and turned quickly away those were cheerful busy days at thornfield the old house had never seen so much life and activity when it was fine the host and his guests went riding visited places of interest and walked in the gardens and when it was wet they played games indoors mr rochester and blanche ingram were always together observing them closely i felt very sure that he would soon marry this fine lady but i did not feel jealous because i knew he did not love her she had made every effort to attract him but he had not given her his heart i saw her faults very clearly she was intelligent but had no opinions of her own she was beautiful but not good she spoke of feelings but she knew nothing of sympathy or pity and above all she had her mother s pride and hardness other eyes apart from mine saw all these faults mr rochester himself knew she was not perfect but he was clearly preparing to marry her perhaps because she was of good family perhaps for some other reason one day when mr rochester was out alone on business a stranger arrived in a carriage and introduced himself as an old friend of the master s his name was mason and he had just returned from the west indies where mr rochester had once lived the gipsy woman no sooner had mr mason joined the group of guests than a servant entered to announce the arrival of an old gipsy woman who was supposed to be a skilled fortune teller the ladies were very excited and decided to ask her to tell their fortunes miss ingram as usual was first and spent fifteen minutes alone with the old woman in the library she came back looking cross it s just childish nonsense how can you all believe in that sort of thing she said picking up a book and pretending to read it but as she frowned more and more and did not turn a page i assumed that the gipsy s words were more important to her than she wanted us to think next three young ladies went in together and came back full of praise for the gipsy s skill she s old and dirty and ugly they cried shocked but she knows everything about us everything while the gentlemen were calming them down the servant entered the room again excuse me miss he said to me the gipsy says there s another young single lady in the room she refuses to leave the house until she has seen all the young ladies it must be you oh i ll go i said gladly i was curious to see the gipsy she was sitting in an armchair in the library murmuring words over a little black book her large black hat covered most of her face but when she lifted her head i saw her dark eyes so you want me to tell your fortune she asked well i must warn you i don t believe in your skill i expected that why don t you tremble i m not cold why don t you turn pale i m not ill why don t you ask me to tell your fortune i m not a fool the old woman laughed and started smoking a short black pipe i can prove that you re cold and ill and a fool she said listen you re cold because you re alone you re ill because you lack love and you re a fool because love is near you and you won t take one step to reach it that s true of many people i said interested yes but especially true of you i can see that happiness is waiting for you if you really want it tell me in that room of fine people isn t there one face you look at one person you re interested in i hardly know the ladies and gentlemen here i answered well you serely know the master of the house what do you think of his relationship with his guests and with one particular guest asked the gipsy smiling wickedly they re all very friendly with each other i replied cautiously the gipsy seemed to know a lot about thornfield friendly i d say more than that in fact i d go so far as to mention the name of blanche ingram and the word marriage they will obviously be an extremely happy couple although i told miss ingram something about the rochester property which made her look quite depressed if a wealthier gentleman comes along mr rchester might lose his beautiful bride but i came to hear about my future not mr rochester s it depends on whether you re going to stretch out your hand for happiness let me look at your face your eyes and your mouth show me that feelings are important to you but your forehead shows me that common sense is your main guide in life you will never do anything wrong or shameful well i respect that i don t want sacrifice or sorrow in my life i want but that will do i d like to stay here looking at you for ever but i must stop acting now was i dreaming what was happening the old woman s voice had changed and become as familiar to me as my own well jane do you know me asked the familiar voice and struggling with the old clothes mr rochester stepped out of his disguise sir you ve been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense it s hardly fair de you forgive me jane i shall try to sir but you shouldn t have done it what are my guests doing jane discussing the gipsy i imagine oh and did you know that a stranger has arrived to see you a stranger i wasn t expecting anyone who can it be his name s mason sir and he comes from the west indies the smile froze on mr rochester s lips and his face went white mason the west indies he repeated three times do you feel ill sir i asked worried jane help me he murmured almost falling i helped him to sit down and sat with him he took my hand and rubbed it gently i wish i were on an island with you and nobody else with no trouble or danger or terrible memories to make me suffer how can i help you sir i d give my life to help you jane if i need help i ll ask you i promise get me a glass of wine now i fetched one from the dining room and gave it to him he looked less pale but very stern jane if all those fine guests of mine came and spat at me what would you do he asked turn them out of the house sir if i could but if they only looked at me coldly and whispered behind their hands about me and then left me one by one i d stay with you sir to comfort you and if the whole world disapproved of me would you still stay with me if you deserved my friendship as i m sure you do i wouldn t care about other people s disapproval thank you jane now go and ask mr mason to come and see me so i did and leaving the two men in the library went to bed much later i heard him showing mr mason to his bedroom and was glad that mr rochester sounded so cheerful the stranger is attacked i was woken by the full moon shining in on me as i had forgotten to draw my curtains suddenly a wild terrible cry broke the silence echoing throughout the house my heart missed a beat what could it mean it came from the top floor then i heard the sounds of a desperate struggle just above my room help help help wofl aflyofl hdp ffi roch ef rochested forc d s sake comj shouted a voice from spst fs bedroom rs were opened as the guests woke up what s happening fetch a candlj is it a fire are there burjars where s rochester he isn t in hs room herel am called the master of the house descending with a candle from the top floor it s all right n t be afrai ladles aservant s had a bad dream that s all and started screaming nothing to worry abut please go back to your rooms you catch cold otherwise and so he calmed his guests and persuaded them to return to their rooms butl knewthat the soundsl had heard could have nothing to do with a servant s dream h idressed and walted in my roonyln easel was needed after about an hour when thotllfi ldhall wss cothpl t ly sllcllt sgslll th f wss cautious knock on my door are you awake jane asked the voice i had been expecting yes sir and dressed good i need you come and help me bring a clean cloth with you we went quietly up to the top floor where he unlocked one of the small black doors do you feel faint at the sight of blood he asked i don t think so i replied we entered a room with curtains hung on the walls one of the curtains was tied back to reveal a secret door into another small room from there came an angry growling sound almost like a dog wait here said mr rochester and went into the secret room where a shout of laughter greeted him ah so grace poole was there he came out quickly and closed the secret door then he showed me why he needed me in an armchair lay mr mason his clothes and his arm covered in blood as we bent over him he opened his eyes and groaned am i going to die he murmured weakly no man don t be foolish it s just a scratch answered mr rochester now jane he said turming to me have to leave you in this room with mason while i fetch the doctor you must wipe away the blood with the damp cloth like this and help him to drink a little water but on no account must you speak to him is that understood i nodded and nervously watched him leave the room i could hear him turning the key in the lock so here i was in the middle of the night locked in with a bleeding dying man and a wild murdering woman only on the other side of a door it seemed a long night interrupted only by mason s groans and by occasional animal like noises from the secret room i had plenty of time to wonder why these violent attacks happened first the fire in mr rochester s room and now a physical attack on a stranger and how was mr mason involved why was he here on the top floor i had heard his host showing him to a bedroom near mine on the second floor and why was mr rochester so frightened when mr mason came to thornfield at last mr rochester arrived with the doctor who cleaned and bandaged mason s wounds strange remarked the doctor the skin on the shoulder has been torn by teeth as well as a knife she bit me murmured mason when rochester managed to get the knife from her well i warned you not to see her alone said rochester you should have waited till the morning then we could have seen her together den t worry man when you get back to the west indies you can forget her think of her as dead and buried now doctor is mason ready to be moved i have a carriage waiting outside you ll take him home with you to avoid gossip and then in a few days he ll be fit enough to leave the country although it was now early morning the house was still in total silence and so there were no witnesses to see mason being helped downstalrs and put in the carriage look after him doctor said rochester goodbye dick edward make sure she s taken care of make sure she s treated well mason could not continue but burst into tears i ll do my best dick as i always have done replied rochester shutting the door of the carriage which rolled away but i wish there was an end to it he murmured to himself as we were walking back through the garden to the house he said to me jane you ve had a strange night you look pale were you afraid when i left you alone with mason not of mason sir but of grace poole in the secret room but i d locked her door i would never leave you in danger will she go on living here sir i asked oh yes don t think about her but i m sure your life is in danger while she s here den t worry i can take care of myself i m in more danger while mason s in england i live in constant fear of a disaster but mr mason s weak you have great influence with him yes he wouldn t knowingly hurt me but by one careless word he could destroy if not my life at least my chance of happiness sit down with me on this bench jane i want to ask you something the early sun warmed the bench and the birds were singing now jane suppose a boy in a foreign country makes a mistake not a crime mind you the results of this mistake have a terrible effect on his whole life he comes home aftef years of suffering and meets someone who is fresh and good and pure now can he ignore society can he forget the past and live the rest of his life with her in peace it was a difficult question to answer in the end i said you can t rely on a human being to cure you of evil and give you peace you must ask for god s help but i think i ve found the cure it s he paused i held my breath i almost thought the birds would stop singing to hear the name he was going to say yes he said in quite a different hard voice you ve noticed my love for miss ingram haven t you don t you think she ll cure me of my wickedness jane oh i can hear some of the guests in the garden go into the house by the back door as i went one way and he another i heard him say cheerfully to the gentlemen mason s already left i got up early to say goodbye to him trouble at gateshead hen i was a child at gateshead bessie the nursemaid used to say that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble to come for a whole week now i had dreamed of a small child every night and perhaps bessie was right as a message came from gateshead it appeared that my cousin john reed who had spent and wasted all his money and some of his mother s and been in debt or in prison most of his life had killed himself a week before and then mrs reed whose health had been badly affected by worrying about her son had suddenly fallen ill when she heard of his death although she could hardly speak she had recently managed to express a wish to see me and so my cousins eliza and georgiana had sent their coachman robert to bring me back to gateshead i felt i could not refuse to see my aunt perhaps for the last time so i went to ask mr rochester s permisson to leave thornfield for a while i found him talking to miss ingram who looked at me in disgust when i interrupted their conversation well jane what is it he asked when we had left the room full of guests and gone into the library please sir i would like permission to visit my aunt who is ill for a week or two your aunt you told me you had no relations i have none who love me sir she s mrs reed my uncle s wife her son has died recently i really can t neglect her now that she is dying what nonsense jane rushing off to visit an old lady who has never loved you but i see you ve decided to go where does she live and how long will you stay she lives at gateshead sir a hundred miles away i ll stay as short a time as can promise me only to stay a week i can t promise sir i might have to stay longer and you certainly can t travel a hundred miles alone they ve sent the coachman for me sir i ll leave tomorrow mr rochester thought for a while well you ll need some money i haven t paid you any salary yet how much have you in the world jane he asked smiling i showed him my tiny purse he took it and laughed as he counted the few coins then he took out his wallet here is he said offering me a note but you only owe me sir i cried on second thoughts give me that back if you had perhaps you would stay away for three months here is is that enough now you owe me sir i pointed out you ll have to come back for it then he said laughing there s something else sir you ve told me you rs going to marry soon in that case ad le should go to boarding school to get her out of my lovely bride s way a very sensible suggestion but what about you i must find another job somewhere i ll advertise don t you dare he growled promise me jane not to look for another job i ll take care of that i ll promise sir if you promise that ad le and i will be out of your house before your bride enters it very well and now we must say goodbye goodbye mr rochester i set out early the next morning and travelled all day as i approached gateshead hall i realized it was nine years since i had left it in that time i had made some friends gained much self confidence and finally lost my hatred of the reeds i was delighted to see my old friend bessie again she had married robert the coachman and was very busy with her three young children the house itself had not changed at all hut my cousins certainly had eliza was now very tall and thin with a rather sour face dressed in very plain clothes and with a cross hanging round her neck georgiana on the other hand was still pretty hut very fat and wore extremely fashionable clothes they did not seem pleased to see me in fact they more or less ignored me but i hardly noticed their rudeness i told the housekeeper that i would be staying for several days and then went straight to my aunt s room i remembered it well from my childhood i had often been called there to be punished bending over her bed i kissed her how are you dear aunt i asked i had sworn never to call her aunt again but i did not regret breaking that promise to myself i held her hand are you jane eyre she asked her face although deathly pale was as stern as ever and she removed her hand from mine that child was more trouble to me than anyone would believe i was glad to send her to lowood and john poor john he needs so much money where can i get more money from what will happen she seemed very confused and excited so i left her to sleep her illness got worse in the next few days i spent some time every day looking after her and the rest of the time with my cousins listening to their plans for the future eliza was planning to joln a religious community after her mother s death but georgiana was hoping to stay in london with relations to see the new fashions and go to all the parties it was quite clear they had no real feeling for their mother and were almost looking forward to her death one dark stormy night i visited the dying woman she lay there asleep in her room neglected by her daughters and servants as i looked out of the window into the black emptiness i wondered about the great mystery of death and thought of helen burns who was so sure her spirit would go to heaven would my aunt s spirit go there too who are you i heard the sick woman murmuring i wanted to see jane eyre i must tell her something i am jane eyre aunt i told her gently i know i m very ill she said weakly before i die i must confess what i ve done wrong first i broke my promise to my husband about you and second she broke off after all perhaps i don t need to tell her she said to herself and then no it s no good i know i m dying i must tell her and quickly jane eyre take the letter from the top drawer of my desk and read it i did so it said why did i never hear of this i asked amazed i hated you so much that i wrote back to him telling him you had died of typhus fever at lowood that was my revenge on you for causing me so much trouble she cried angrily dear aunt i said don t think about that any more i was omly a child it s not surprising i was a nuisance you were always so angry and violent such a wicked child not as wicked as you think i would have loved you if you d let me forget it all and kiss me now aunt but it was too late for her to break the habit of dislike and she turned away from me poor woman she died soon afterwards keeping her hatred of me alive in her heart and no one at gateshead cried for her the future mrs rochester and so i set out on the long journey back to thornfield mrs fairfax had written to me while i was at gateshead telling me that the guests had all gone and mr rochester had gone to london to buy a carriage for his wedding it was clear that he would be getting married very soon after a long day sitting in the coach i decided to get out at millcote leave my luggage at the hotel and walk across the fields to thornfield it was a warm june evening and i felt glad to be going home i had to remind myself sternly that thornfield was not my permanent home and that the person i was so looking forward to seeing was perhaps not even thinking of me and then i saw him he was sitting on the gate ahead of me writing in a notebook he noticed me at once hallo he cried i was trembling at the unexpected sight of him and could not control my voice so i approached in silence so it s jane eyre he continued why didn t you send for a carriage it s just like you to come on foot from millcote now what have you been doing for a whole month i ve been looking after my aunt sir who s just died you come from another world jane from the world of the dead i think you must be a spirit and absent for a whole month i m sure you ve quite forgotten me even though i knew i would soon lose him he had such power to make me happy that i was in heaven listening to him did mrs fairfax tell you i ve been to london he asked oh yes sir she did and i expect she told you why i went there well you must see the carriage i ve bought jane it will suit mrs rochester perfectly i only wish i were more handsome as she s so beautiful can t you put one of your spells on me to make me more attractive for her that s beyond the power of magic sir i replied while thinking to someone who loves you you are handsome enough mr rochester was sometimes able to read my thoughts but this time he just smiled warmly at me and opened the gate pass friend he said and welcome home i could have just walked past him in silence but something made me turn and say quickly before i could stop myself thank you mr rochester for your great kindness i m glad to come back to you and wherever you are is my home my only home i ran across the field and into the house before he had time to answer two weeks passed after my return with no news of the wedding there were no preparations at thornfield and no visits to the ingram family who lived only a few miles away i almost began to hope it was the middle of summer and every day the sun shone on the green fields the white baked roads and the cool dark woods one evening after adele had gone to sleep i went into the garden i discovered a quiet place where i thought nobody would find me but then i noticed mr rochester had come into the garden too hoping to escape back to the house i crept quietly behind him while he was bending over to admire an insect but jane he said suddenly come and look at this beautiful insect oh now he s flown away no don t go back to the house jane on such a lovely night come and walk with me i could not find a reason for leaving him so i accompanied him in silence jane he began you like thornfield don t you and you even like little adele and old mrs fairfax don t you i do sir i really don t want to leave them what a pity he sighed that s what happens in life no sooner have you got used to a place than you have to move on do i have to move on sir leave thornfield i m afraid you must jane then you are going to be married sir exactly jane and as you have pointed out when i take the lovely miss ingram as my bride you and adele must leave the house so i m looking for a new job for you i m sorry to cause you trouble i said miserably no trouble at all in fact i ve already heard of a very good job which would be just right for you teaching the five daughters of an irish family you ll like ireland i think they re such friendly people he said cheerfully it s such a long way away sir i was fighting to keep my tears back there was an icy coldness in my heart away from what jane from england and from thornfield and well from you sir i could not stop myself and burst into tears immediately it certainly is very far away he said calmly let s sit on this bench jane like old friends saying goodbye you know i sometimes feel as if you and i were connected by a string tying our two hearts together and if you went to ireland i think that string might break and i might bleed to death i wish i wish i d never been born i cried i wish i d never come to thornfield no longer able to control my feelings i poured out what was in my heart i can t bear to leave because here i ve been treated kindly and because i ve met you mr rochester and i can t bear never to see you again now i have to leave i feel as if i m dying why do you have to leave he asked innocently why i repeated amazed because you re marrying miss ingram she s your bride my bride i have no bride he answered but i will have one and you must stay i can t stay i cried furiously do you think i can watch another woman become your bride do you think i m a machine without feelings do you think because i m small and poor and plain that i have no soul and no heart well you re wrong i have as much soul and heart as you it is my spirit that speaks to your spirit we are equal in the sight of god we are repeated mr rochester taking me in his arms and kissing me don t struggle jane like a wild restless bird let me go mr rochester i am no bird but a free human being and i managed to break away yes jane you are free to decide i ask you to walk through life with me to be my constant companion you re laughing at me you ve already chosen your companion for life i was crying quietly while mr rochester looked gently and seriously at me jane he said i ask you to be my wife you are my equal jane will you marry me don t you believe me not at all i answered i ll convince you listen i don t love miss ingram and she doesn t love me she only liked me for my wealth and when i disguised as the gipsy woman told her that i had only a little money she and her mother lost interest in me you strange magical spirit i love you you small and poor and plain i ask you to marry me you want to marry me i cried almost beginning to believe him but i have no friends no money no family i don t care jane say yes quickly it s cruel to make me suffer like this give me my name say edward i ll marry you he cried his face very pale in the moonlight are you serious do you really love me do you honestly want me to be your wife i asked i swear it then edward i will marry you my little wife he held me in his arms for a long time kissing me gently once he murmured no family that s good no family to interfere and then i don t care what people think and again and again are you happy jane i thought of nothing except the great happiness of being with him for ever but while we were talking the weather had changed a strong wind was now blowing and there was a loud crack of thunder suddenly rain poured down and although we hurried back to the house we were quite wet when we arrived in the hall we did not notice mrs fairfax standing in the shadows good night my darling he said kissing me repeatedly as i ran upstairs i caught sight of the old lady s shocked face tomorrow i ll explain to her i thought just then i was too happy to think about anything except our bright future outside the storm continued furiously all night and in the morning we discovered that the great tree at the bottom of the garden which had stood for hundreds of years had been hit by lightning and torn in half preparing for the wedding i was a little nervous before seeing mr rochester next morning was i really going to marry him or was it all a dream but i soon felt calmer when he came to meet me and kissed me jane you look well and smiling and pretty he said you will be jane rochester in four weeks time not a day more i ll send for my family jewels which are kept in a london bank they are for my bride whether she s a great lady or a governess oh no sir i cried i m too plain for jewels i m not used to wearing them i insist jane today i m taking you in the carriage to millcote to buy you some elegant clothes in a month s time we ll have a quiet wedding in the local church and after a few days in london we ll travel through all the countries of europe well sir you seem very eager to please me but i wonder if you will agree to a request of mine ask me anything jane anything indeed i will this is my request i ask you not to give me jewels and fine clothes if that s really your wish i agree but can t you think of anything i can give you well i d like you to give me the answer to a question he looked worried and turned away from me curiosity is dangerous he said i may not be able to agree to this particular request well what is it how stern you look i suppose that s how you will look when we are married this is what i want to know why did you take such trouble to make me believe you wished to marry miss ingram he stopped frowning at once and smiled down at me is that all what a relief all right i shall have to confess although you may be angry with me jane as angry as you were last night when you told me we were equal well i pretended to love miss ingram to make you madly jealous i wanted you to be as much in love wlth me as i was with you and i suppose you didn t care at all about poor miss ingram s feelings she only has one feeling pride were you jealous jane never mind mr rochester one more request please explain everything to mrs fairfax she looked so shocked last night when i visited the old housekeeper later that day i found she was amazed by the news that i was going to marry the master i would never have thought it she kept repeating mr rochester so proud and such a gentleman to marry his governess she examined me closely as if to discover the reason for this strange event and shook her head still puzzled he s twenty years older than you he could be your father no indeed mrs fairfax i replied crossly he looks much younger than that is he really going to marry you for love she asked i was so hurt by her amazement that tears came to my eyes why i asked do you think he couldn t possibly love me no no miss eyre but you must realize that this is a very unusual situation you must be careful of your reputation i advise you to keep him at a distance until you are married although i was upset by the old lady s words i followed her advice and in the weeks before the wedding i went on teaching adele as usual only in the evenings did i spend some time with mr rochester and i was careful not to allow him to hold me in his arms or kiss me sometimes he was angry with me and called me a hard little thing or a cruel spirit but i preferred that to being called my darling i saw that mrs fairfax approved of my correct behaviour and i knew that he respected me for it but it was not easy for me i would rather have shown him my love my future husband was becoming my whole world and more than that my hope of heaven at last the night before the wedding arrived my clothes were packed and i was ready but i was anxious to see mr rochester who had been away on business so i ran out of the quiet house to meet him on the road a wild stormy wind was blowing and in the garden i passed the wreck of the great tree then suddenly i saw him riding towards me you see he shouted you can t do without me jump up onto my horse together we rode back to thornfield while he ate dinner i sat quietly beside him he looked closely at me you look sad jane he said is anything wrong are you nervous about your new life no i replied firmly i m not worried about that because i love you but last night i had a strange dream a terrible dream it was dark and windy outside and before i went to sleep i could hear a dog growling in the distance in my dream i was carrying a small child in my arms down a long road i was trying to catch up with you but i couldn t and you still worry about a foolish dream when i m close to you but say you love me again jane i do love you edward but i haven t finished my story is there more well go on i dreamed that thornfield was totally destroyed just a heap of stones i was still carrying the child but now i could see you riding away into the distance i knew you would never come back then i woke up that s all then jane nothing to worry about no wait there was candle light in my room and a strange shape examining the wedding dress hanging in my cupboard my blood ran cold it wasn t mrs fairfax or any of the servants it wasnt t even grace poole it was a horrible sight describe the shape jane it looked like a tall woman with long thick dark hair hanging down hhe took up the beautiful veil you bought me put it on her own head then turned to admire herself in the mirror it was then that i saw her wild inhuman face she removed the veil tore it in two and threw it on the floor and then mr rochester seemed almost nervous she came to my bedside put her candle close to my face and stared fiercely at me i must have fainted and i suppose she left now can you tell me who or what that woman was jane you are too sensitive that was just a dream don t think about it any more he answered comfortingly that s just what i said to myself when i woke up this morning but when i looked on the floor there was me veil torn in two halves i felt mr rochester suddenly tremble to think what might have happened he cried throwing his arms around me thank god it was only the veil after a few moments he said calmly now jane be sensible that woman must have been grace poole there is no other explanation perhaps you re right i admitted slowly one day i ll explain to you why i keep her in my house but tonight go and sleep in adele s room you ll be quite safe there just dream about our future the wedding day we had no friends or family to accompany us to the church i had not told my reed cousins about our wedding but i had written to my uncle john eyre in madeira mr rochester was in such a hurry that he only allowed me a short time to put on my wedding dress and veil jane you look lovely he said but you can only have ten minutes for breakfast we almost ran up the road to the church his strong hand holding mine his dark face looked stern and he did not speak i did not notice the weather or my surroundings at all i only wanted to know why he looked so fierce suddenly he noticed how pale i was and stopped for a moment to let me get my breath back then we walked more slowly into the church the priest and the clerk were waiting for us there was nobody else except two strangers who were standing at the back of the church the ceremony began and soon i heard the priest come to the point in the wedding where he had to ask is there any reason why these two people should not be married the priest paused for a second as was the custom but before he could continue a voice from the back of the church said clearly there is a reason the priest looked up from his book and stood silent mr rochester said in his deep voice without turning his head continue with the ceremony silence fell again then the priest shook his head i must investigate this first he said one of the strangers from the back of the church came forward and said calmly and quietly this wedding cannot continue because mr rochester is already married i felt as if i had been hit mr rochester s whole face was like colourless marble without speaking or smiling he was holding me tightly round the waist as if he wodld never let go who are you he growled at the stranger and tell me what you know of this supposed wife of mine i m a lawyer sir i have a certificate here proving that you married bertha mason in the west indies fifteen years ago that may prove i ve been married but it doesn t prove that she s still alive i can produce a witness said the lawyer who has seen her alive recently produce him or go to hell said mr rochester here he is mr mason called the lawyer and the second stranger slowly spproached from the shadows his pale face looking frightened mr rochester staring furiously at him raised his strong right arm to knock him down no cried mason trembling mr rochester dropped his arm and turned away in disgust sir said the priest frowning don t forget we are in the house of god mr mason please tell us if this gentleman s wife is still alive she s at thornfield hall replied mason in a weak voice i m her brother and i ve seen her there thornfield hall crled the priest i ve lived here for years and i ve never heard of a mrs rochester i was careful to keep her a secret murmured mr rochester frowning after a few minutes thought he announced i must reveal the truth i suppose there will be no wedding today no doubt god will punish me for this what this lawyer says is true i ve been married and my wife still lives i was tricked into marrying her when i was young in the west indies madness runs in her family but they didn t tell me that now she s more of an anlmal than a woman i keep her locked away guarded by my old servant grace poole i invite you all to come to my house to see her and to judge whether i had the right to ask this innocent young girl to marry me follow me still holding me firmly he left the church followed by the others at the door of thornfield hall mrs faurfax adele and the servants rushed forward smiling to congratulate us too late cried the master waving them away your congratulations are fifteen years too late we all went up to the top floor and entered the room where mason had been attacked mr rochester lifted the curtain opened the secret door and showed us the little room grace poole was making soup over a fire and behind her a shape crawled on the floor it was hard to say whether it was animal or human it growled like a wild animal but it wore clothes and had long thick dark hair how are you mrs poole asked the master and how is your patient today not bad sir answered grace but be careful she ll try and bite you if she sees you sir just then the shape turned and with a fierce cry attacked mr rochester violently i recognized her dark ugly face they struggled for a moment and then he held her down and with mrs poole s help tied her to a chair he turned to the others with a bitter smile you see gentlemen this is my wife this is the partner i have to live with for ever and instead i wished to have this laying his hand on my shoulder this young girl can you honestly blame me compare the two and then judge me we all left the room silently as we went downstairs the lawyer said to me i know you weren t aware of this miss eyre nobody will blame you and mr mason will tell your uncle so when he goes back to madeira my uncle do you know him i asked surprised i m his lawyer mr mason and he have often done business together on his way back to the west indies mr mason stopped in madeira and stayed with mr eyre who mentioned that his niece was going to marry a mr rochester yes i wrote to tell him i was getting married i said well when mr mason explained that mr rochester was already married your uncle sent him straight back to england to prevent you from marrying and making a terrible mistake i m afraid your uncle is very ill and will probably die soon so i think you had better stay in england until you receive further news of him after the gentlemen had left i entered my room and locked the door slowly i took off my wedding dress and veil i was weak and exhausted and only just beginning to realize what had happened could i ever again trust the being i had turned into a sort of god i would not think of him as evil but he could not have felt real love for me how foolish i had been to believe him and love him so much my hopes were all dead and my future was empty i lay on my bed faint and wishing for death while darkness swam around me mr rochester s explanation sometime in the afternoon i recovered a little but i felt faint as i stood up and realized i had not eaten anything all day so i opened my bedroom door and almost fell over mr rochester who was sitting in a chair just outside i ve been waiting for you all this time jane he said and i haven t heard you scream or shout or cry aren t you angry with me i never meant to hurt you will you ever forgive me he sounded so sincere that i forgave him at once in my heart scold me jane tell me how wicked i am he said sir i can t i feel tired and weak i want some water he took me in his arms and carried me downstairs to the library where he put me in front of the fire and gave me a glass of wine i began to feel better he bent to kiss me but i turned my face determinedly away what he cried you refuse to kiss me because i m bertha mason s husband is that it yes sir i know you very well jane i know how firm you are when you ve decided something you re planning to destroy my hope of happiness you intend to be a stranger to me from now on and if i m friendly towards you in future you ll remind yourself that man nearly made me his mistress i must be ice cold to him and ice cold is what you ll be it s true sir i said trying to stop my voice from trembling that everything around me has changed so i must change too adele must have a new governess oh adele will go to boarding school i ve already decided that and you and i will both leave this house this narrow stone hell this house of living death we can never be happy here under the same roof as that woman oh i hate her you shouldn t hate her sir i said it s not her fault she s mad poor thing jane my darling it s not because she s mad that i hate her if you were mad i wouldn t hate you i d look after you lovingly but why talk of madness we are all ready to travel everything is packed tomorrow we ll leave i have a place to go to where nobody will find us or talk about us and take adele with you sir she ll be a companion for you i interrupted i knew i had to tell him soon adele what do you mean jane she s going to school i don t want her i want you with me do you understand i did but i slowly shook my head he was becoming angry and was staring fiercely at me he looked as if he was about to lose control i was not at all afraid because i knew i still had the power to calm him so i took his hand and stroked it saying sit down sir i ll talk or listen to you as long as you like i had been struggling with tears for some time and now i let them flow freely it was a great relief don t cry jane please be calm he begged how can i be calm when you re so angry i m not angry but i love you so much and your pale little face looked so stern and decided he tried to put his arm round me but i would not let him jane he said sadly you don t love me then i do love you i answered more than ever but this is the last time i can say it there is only one thing for me to do but you ll be furious if i mention it oh mention it if i m angry you can always burst into tears he said with a half smile mr rochester i must leave you i must start a new life among strangers of course i told you we would leave i ll ignore that nonsense about you leaving me you ll be mrs rochester and i ll be your husband until i die we ll live happily and innocently together in a little white house i have in the south of france jane don t shake your head or i ll get angry sir your wife is alive i dared to say although he was looking aggressively at me and if i lived with you like that i d be your mistress i m a fool he said suddenly i haven t told you the whole story oh i m sure you ll agree when you know everything listen jane you know that my father loved money very much i heard someone say that yes sir well he hated the idea of dividing the family property so he left it all to my elder brother but that meant i would be poor unless i married a rich wife so he decided i should marry bertna mason the daughter of his wealtny friend jonas mason i was young and easily impressed so when i saw her in the west indies beautiful and elegantly dressed i thought i loved her what a fool i was then after the wedding i learned that my bride s mother and younger brother were both mad dick mason will probably be in the same state one day my father knew all this but did not tell me i soon found that bertha and i had nothing in common not only was she coarse and stupid her madness also made her violent i lived with her for four years by now my father and brother were dead so i was rich but i considered myself poor because i was tied to a mad wife until death i pity you sir i do pity you pity jane is an insult from some people but from you i accept it as the mother of love well i had moments of despair when i intended to shoot myself but in the end i decided to bring the mad woman back to thornfield hall where nobody knew that we were married she has lived here ever since even mrs fairfax and the servants don t know the whole truth about her but although i pay grace poole well and trust her absolutely she sometimes drinks too much and allows the creature to escape twice she has got out of her room at night as you know the first time she nearly burnt me in my bed and the second time she visited you and must have been reminded of her own wedding day by seeing your wedding dress and what did you do sir when you had brought her here i travelled all over europe jane i was looking for a good and intelligent woman to love but you couldn t marry sir i interrupted i believed i could i thought i might find some reasonable woman who would understand my case and accept me well sir did you not in europe jane where i spent ten long years looking for an ideal i tried taking mistresses like celine the french dancer but finally bitter and disappointed with my wasted life i returned to thornfield on a frosty winter afternoon and when my horse slipped and fell on the ice a little figure appeared and insisted on helping me in the weeks that followed i began to depend on that bird like little figure for my happiness and new interest in life don t talk any more of the past sir i said wiping a secret tear from my eyes no jane you re right the future is much brighter you understand now don t you i ve wasted half my life in misery and loneliness but now i ve found you you are at the centre of my heart it was stupid of me to try to marry you like that without explaining i should have confessed everything as i do now and appealed to your great generosity of spirit i promise to love you and stay with you for ever jane promise me the same a pause why are you silent jane this was a terrible moment for me in the struggle and confusion that was going on in my heart i knew that he loved me and i loved him but i also knew that i must leave him jane just promise me i will be yours mr rochester i will not be yours another pause jane he said with a gentleness that cut into my soul jane do you intend us to live apart for ever i do jane bending towards me and kissing me is that still your intention it is i replied pulling away from him oh jane this is a bitter shock it would not be wicked to love me it would be wicked to do what you want jane just imagine my horrible life when you have gone i shall be alone with that mad woman upstairs where shall i find friendship and hope you can only trust in god and yourself live without doing wrong and die hoping to go to heaven that s impossible without you and and you have no family to offend by living with me he was beginning to sound desperate i knew that what he said was true however in my heart i also knew i was right to leave he seemed to read my thoughts rushing furiously across the room he seized me violently and stared fiercely into my eyes he could have broken me in two with one hand but he could not break my spirit small and weak as i was i stared firmly back at him your eyes jane he said are the eyes of a bird a free wild being even if i break your cage i can t reach you beautiful creature you ll fly away from me but you could choose to fly to me come jane come he let me go and only looked at me how hard it was to resist that look i am going i said does my deep love mean nothing to you oh jane my hope my love my life and be threw himself despairingly on the sofa i had reached the door but i could not leave i walked back bent over him and kissed his cheek goodbye my dear master i said may god protect you without your love jane my heart is broken he said but perhaps you will so generously give me your love after all he jumped up with hope in his eyes holding out his arms to me but i turned and ran out of the room that night i only slept a little dreaming of the red room at gateshead the moonlight shone into my bedroom as it did then and i saw a vision on the ceiling a white figure looking down on me it seemed to whisper to my spirit daughter leave now before you are tempted to stay mother i will i answered and when i woke up although it was still dark outside i wrapped up some spare clothes in a parcel and put a little money in a purse as i crept downstairs i could hear mr rochester in his room walking up and down and sighing i could find heaven in this room if i wanted i just had to enter and say i will love you and live with you through life until death my hand moved towards the handle but i stopped myself and went miserably downstairs and out of the house setting out on the road i could not help thinking of mr rochester s despair when he found himself abandoned i hated myself for wounding him and for perhaps driving him to a life of wickedness or even death i wanted desperately to be with him to comfort him but somehow i made myself keep walking and when a coach passed i arranged to travel on it as far as my money would pay for inside the coach i cried the bitterest tears of my life finding shelter i was put down at whitcross a crossroads on the moor after travelling for two days in the coach as it rolled away i realized i had left my parcel inside and given the coachman all the coins in my purse i was alone on the open moor with no money or possessions lonely white roads stretched across the great wide moors as far as the hills i was glad to see there were no towns here because i did not want people to question me or pity me so i walked across the moor until i found a dry place to sleep in the shelter of a small hill luckily it was a warm night with no rain the next day was hot and sunny but i needed food and water so i could not stay on the moor taking one of the white roads i eventually found a small village i needed all my courage to knock on some of the doors asking if there was any paid work i could do none of the village people could help me and i could not bring myself to beg for food although by now i felt weak and faint at the baker s i offered to exchange my leather gloves for a small cake but the baker s wife looked at my dirty clothes and said i m sorry but how do i know you haven t stolen them all i ate that day was a piece of bread which i begged from a farmer eating his supper i spent another night on the moor but this time the air was cold and the ground was damp next day i walked from house to house again looking in vain for work i was now very weak from lack of food and i began to wonder why i should struggle to stay alive when i did not want to live it was getting dark again and i was alone on the moor in the distance i could see a faint light and i decided to try to reach it the wind and rain beat down on me and i fell down several times but finally i arrived at a long low house standing rather isolated in the middle of the moor hiding near the door i could just see into the kitchen through a small uncurtained window there was an elderly woman who might be the housekeeper mending clothes and two young ladies who seemed to be learning a language with dictionaries the kitchen looked so clean and bright and the ladies so kind and sensible that i dared to knock at the door the elderly woman opened it but she must have thought i was a thief or a beggar because she refused to let me speak to the young ladies the door closed firmly shutting me out from the warmth inside i dropped on to the wet doorstep worn out and hopeless prepared to die there the young ladies brother found me when he returned home a few minutes later and he insisted much against the housekeeper s wishes on bringing me into the house they gave me bread and milk and asked my jane elliott i replied i did not want anybody to know where i had come from to their further questions i answered that i was too tired to speak finally they helped me upstairs to a bedroom and i sank gratefully into a warm dry bed for three days and nights i lay in bed exhausted by my experiences and hardly conscious of my surroundings as i was recovering hannah the housekeeper came to sit with me and told me all about the family she had known them since they were babies their mother had been dead for years and their father had died only three weeks before the girls diana and mary rivers had to work as governesses as their father had lost a lot of money in business st john their brother was the vicar in the nearest village morton they only used this house called moor house in the holidays when i felt strong enough to get dressed and go downstairs diana and mary looked after me very kindly and made me feel welcome in their pleasant home their brother however seemed stern and cold he was between twenty eight and thirty fair haired and extremely handsome diana and mary were curious about my past but sensitive enough to avoid asking questions which would hurt me st john on the other hand made determined efforts to discover who i was but i just as firmly refused to explain more than necessary i told them only that after attending lowood school i became a governess in a wealthy family where an unfortunate event not in any way my fault caused me to run away that was all i was prepared to say i offered to do any kind of work teaching sewing cleaning so that i could become independent again st john approved of my keenness to work and promised to find me some paid employment a new home i spent a month at moor house in an atmosphere of warm friendship i learned to love what diana and mary loved the little old grey house the wild open moors around it and the lonely hills and valleys where we walked for hours i read the books they read and we discussed them eagerly diana started teaching me german and i helped mary to improve her drawing we three shared the same interests and opinions and spent the days and evenings very happily together however st john hardly ever joined in our activities he was often away from home visiting the poor and the sick in morton his strong sense of duty made him insist on going even if the weather was very bad but despite his hard work i thought he lacked true happiness and peace of mind he often stopped reading or writing to stare into the distance dreaming perhaps of some ambitious plan once i heard him speak at a church service in morton and although he was an excellent speaker there was a certain bitterness and disappointment in his words he was clearly not satisfied with his present life the holiday was coming to an end soon diana and mary would leave moor house to return to the wealthy families in the south where they were both governesses and st john would go back to the vicar s house in morton with hannah his housekeeper although his cold manner made it difficult for me to talk to him i had to ask him whether he had found any employment for me i have he answered slowly but remember i am only a poor country vicar and can t offer you a job with a high salary so you may not wish to accept it there s already a school for boys in morton and now i want to open one for girls so i ve rented a building for it it with a small small cottage for the schoolteacher miss oliver who lives in the area and is the only daughter of a rich factory owner has kindly paid for the furniture will you be the schoolteacher you would live in the cottage rent free and receive thirty pounds a year no more i thought about it for a moment it was not as good as being a governess in an important family but at least i would have no master i would be free and independent thank you mr rivers i accept gladly i replied but you do understand he asked a little worried it will only be a village school the girls will be poor and uneducated you ll be teaching reading writing counting sewing that s all there ll be no music or languages or painting i understand and i ll be happy to do it i answered he smiled well satisfied with me and i ll open the school tomorrow if you like i added very good he agreed then looking at me he said but i don t think you ll stay long in the village why not i m not ambitious although i think you are he looked surprised i know i am but how did you discover that no i think you won t be satisfied by living alone you need people to make you happy he said no more diana and mary lost their usual cheerfulness as the moment for leaving their home and their brother came closer you see jane diana explained st john is planning to become a missionary very soon he feels his purpose in life is to spread the christian religion in unexplored places where the people have never heard the word of god so we won t see him for many years perhaps never again he looks quiet jane but he s very determined i know he s doing god s work but it will break my heart to see him leave and she broke down in tears mary wiped her own tears away as she said we ve lost our father soon we ll lose our brother too just then st john himself entered reading a letter our uncle john is dead he announced the sisters did not look shocked or sad but seemed to be waiting for more information st john gave them the letter to read and then they all looked at each other smiling rather tiredly well said diana at least we have enough money to live on we don t really need any more yes said st john but unfortunately we can imagine how different our lives might have been he went out there was a silence for a few minutes then diana turned to me jane you must be surprised that we don t show any sadness at our uncle s death i must explain we ve never met him he was my mother s brother and he and my father quarrelled years ago about a business deal that s when my father lost most of his money my uncle on the other hand made a fortune of twenty thousand pounds as he never married and had no relations apart from us and one other person my father always hoped we would inherit uncle john s money but it seems this other relation has inherited his whole fortune of course we shouldn t have expected anything but mary and i would have felt rich with only a thousand pounds each and st john would have been able to help more poor people she said no more and none of us referred to the subject again that evening the next day the rivers family returned to their separate places of work and i moved to the cottage in morton mr rivers sacrifice i had twenty village girls to teach some of them with such a strong country accent that i could hardly communicate with them only three could read and none could write so at the end of my first day i felt quite depressed at the thought of the hard work ahead of me but i reminded myself that i was fortunate to have any sort of job and that i would certainly get used to teaching these girls who although they were very poor might be as good and as intelligent as children from the greatest families in england ever since i ran away from thornfield mr rochester had remained in my thoughts and now as i stood at my cottage door that first evening looking at the quiet fields i allowed myself to imagine again the life i could have had with him in his little white house in the south of france he would have loved me oh yes he would have loved me very much for a while he did love me i thought nobody will ever love me like that again but then i told myself that i would only have been his mistress in a foreign country and for a short time until he grew tired of me i should be much happier here as a schoolteacher free and honest in the healthy heart of england but strangely enough st john rivers found me crying as he approached the cottage frowning at the sight of the tears on my cheeks he asked me do you regret accepting this job then oh no i replied quickly i m sure i ll get used to it soon and i m really very grateful to have a home and work to do after all i had nothing a few weeks ago but you feel lonely perhaps he asked still puzzled i haven t had time to feel lonely yet well i advise you to work hard and hot to look back into your past if something which we know is wrong tempts us then we must make every effort to avoid it by putting our energy to better use a year ago i too was very miserable because i was bored by the routine life of a country vicar and i was tempted to change my profession but suddenly there was light in my darkness and god called me to be a missionary no profession could be greater than that since that moment of truth i have been perfectly happy making my preparations for leaving england and going abroad in the service of god happy that is except for one little human weakness which i have sworn to overcome his eyes shone as he spoke of his great purpose in life and i was listening fascinated so neither of us heard the light footsteps approaching the cottage along the grassy path good evening mr rivers said a charming voice as sweet as a bell st john jumped as if hit between the shoulders then turned slowly and stiffly to face the speaker a vision in white with a young girlish figure was standing beside him when she threw back her veil she revealed a face of perfect beauty st john glanced quickly at her but dared not look at her for long he kept his eyes on the ground as he answered a lovely evening but it s late for you to be out alone oh father told me you d opened the new girls school so i simply had to come to meet the new schoolteacher that must be you she said to me smiling do you like morton and your pupils and your cottage i realized this must be the rich miss oliver who had generously furnished my cottage yes indeed miss oliver i replied i m sure i ll enjoy teaching here and i like my cottage very much i ll come and help you teach sometimes i get so bored at home mr rivers i ve been away visiting friends you know i ve had such fun i was dancing with the officers until two o clock this morning they re all so charming st john s face looked sterner than usual and his lip curled in disapproval as he lifted his handsome head and looked straight into miss oliver s laughing eyes he breathed deeply and his chest rose as if his heart wanted to fly out of its cage but he said nothing and after a pause miss oliver continued do come and visit my father mr rivers why don t you ever come i can t come miss rosamund it seemed clear to me that st john had to struggle with himself to refuse this smiling invitation well if you don t want to i must go home then goodbye she held out her hand he just touched it his hand trembling goodbye he said in a low hollow voice his face as white as a sheet they walked away in different directions she turned back twice to look at him but he did not turn round at all the sight of another person s suffering and sacrifice stopped me thinking so much about my own problems i had plenty of opportunities to observe st john and miss oliver together every day st john taught one bible lesson at the school and miss oliver who knew her power over him always chose that particular moment to arrive at the school door in her most attractive riding dress she used to walk past the rows of admiring pupils towards the young vicar smiling openly at him he just stared at her as if he wanted to say i love you and i know you love me if i offered you my heart i think you d accept but my heart is already promised as a sacrifice to god but he never said anything and she always turned sadly away like a disappointed child no doubt he would have given the world to call her back but he would not give his chance of heaven when i discovered that miss oliver s father greatly admired the rivers family and would have no objection to her marrying a vicar i decided to try to persuade st john to marry her i thought he could do more good with miss oliver s money in england than as a missionary under the baking sun in the east my chance came some weeks later when he visited me one november evening in my little cottage he noticed a sketch i had been doing of miss oliver and could not take his eyes off it i could paint you an exact copy i said gently if you admit that you would like it she s so beautiful he murmured still looking at it i would certainly like to have it she likes you i m sure i said greatly daring and her father respects you you ought to marry her it s very pleasant to hear this he said not at all shocked by my honesty i shall allow myself fifteen minutes to think about her and he actually put his watch on the table and sat back in his chair closing his eyes married to the lovely rosamund oliver let me just imagine it my heart is full of delight and there was silence for a quarter of an hour until he picked up his watch and put the sketch back on the table temptation has a bitter taste he said shaking his head i can t marry her you see although i love her so deeply i know that rosamund would not make a good wife for a missionary but you needn t be a missionary i cried indeed i must it s the great work god has chosen me to do i shall carry with me into the darkest corners of the world knowledge peace freedom religion the hope of heaven that is what i live for and what i shall die for what about miss oliver i asked after a moment she may be very disappointed if you don t marry her miss oliver will forget me in a month and will probably marry someone who ll make her far happier than i ever could you speak calmly but i know you re suffering you are original he said looking surprised he had clearly not imagined that men and women could discuss such deep feelings together but believe me i have overcome this weakness of mine and become as hard as a rock my only ambition now is to serve god as he picked up his hat before leaving something on a piece of paper on the table caught his eye he glanced at me then tore off a tiny piece very quickly and with a rapid goodbye rushed out of the cottage i could not imagine what he had found to interest him so much sudden wealth when st john left it was beginning to snow and it continued snowing all night and all the next day in the evening i sat by my fire listening to the wind blowing outside and had just started reading when i heard a noise the wind i thought was shaking the door but no it was st john who came in out of the frozen darkness his coat covered in snow what s happened i cried amazed i thought nobody would be out in weather like this what s the matter there s nothing wrong he answered calmly hanging up his coat and stamping the snow from his boots i just came to have a little talk to you besides since yesterday i ve been eager to hear the other half of your story he sat down i had no idea what he was referring to and remembering his strange behaviour with the piece of paper i began to fear that he might be going mad he looked quite normal however and we made conversation for a while although he seemed to be thinking of something else suddenly he said when i arrived i said i wanted to hear the rest of your story but perhaps it s better if i tell the story i m afraid you ve heard it before but listen anyway twenty years ago a poor vicar fell in love with a rich man s daughter she also fell in love with him and married him against the advice of all her family sadly less than two years later the couple were both dead i ve seen their grave their baby daughter was brought up by an aunt a mrs reed of gateshead you jumpeddid you hear a noise i ll continue i don t know whether the child was happy with mrs reed but she stayed there ten years until she went to lowood school where you were yourself in fact it seems her life was quite similar to yours she became a teacher at lowood as you did and then became a governess in the house of a certain mr rochester mr rivers i interrupted unable to keep silent i can imagine how you feel he replied but wait till i ve finished i don t know anything about mr rochester s character but i do know that he offered to marry this young girl who only discovered during the wedding ceremony that he was in fact already married to a mad woman the governess disappeared soon after this and although investigations have been carried out and advertisements placed in newspapers and every effort made to find her nobody knows where she s gone but she must be found mr briggs a lawyer has something very important to tell her just tell me one thing i said urgently what about mr rochester how and where is he what s he doing is he well i know nothing about mr rochester why don t you ask the name of the governess and why everybody is looking for her did mr briggs write to mr rochester i asked he did but he received an answer not from him but from the housekeeper a mrs fairfax i felt cold and unhappy no doubt mr rochester had left england for a life of wild pleasure in the cities of europe that was what i had been afraid of oh my poor master once almost my husband who i had often called my dear edward as you won t ask the governess s name i ll tell you myself continued st john i ve got it written down it s always better to have facts in black and white and he took out of his wallet a tiny piece of paper which i recognized as part of my sketch book and showed it to me on it i read in my own writing jane eyre which i must have written without thinking the advertisements and briggs spoke of a jane eyre but i only knew a jane elliott said st john are you jane eyre yes yes but doesn t mr briggs know anything about mr rochester i asked desperately i don t think briggs is at all interested in mr rochester you re forgetting the really important thing don t you want to know why he s been looking for you well what did he want i asked almost rudely only to tell you that your uncle mr eyre of madeira is dead that he has left you all his property and that you re now rich only that nothing more rich one moment i was poor the next moment i was wealthy it was hard to realize my new situation a fortune brings serious worries and responsibilities with it which i could hardly imagine i was sorry to hear that my uncle my only surviving relation was dead however the inheritance would give me independence for life and i was glad of that perhaps you would like to know how much you ve inherited offered st john politely it s nothing much really just twenty thousand pounds i think twenty thousand pounds the news took my breath away st john who i had never heard laugh before actually laughed out loud at my shocked face perhaps perhaps you ve made a mistake i asked him nervously no there s no mistake now i must be leaving good night he was about to open the door when suddenly i called stop why did mr briggs write to you in order to find me oh i m a vicar i have ways of discovering things no that doesn t satisfy me tell me the truth i insisted putting myself between him and the door well i d rather not tell you just now but i suppose you ll discover it sooner or later did you know that my full name is st john eyre rivers no i didn t but then what and i stopped as light flooded my mind and i saw clearly the chain of circumstances which connected us but st john continued his explanation my mother s name was eyre he said she had two brothers one a vicar who married miss jane reed of gateshead and the other john eyre of madeira mr briggs mr eyre s lawyer wrote to us telling us that our uncle had died and left all his property not to us because of his quarrel with our father but to his brother s daughter then mr briggs wrote again later saying this girl could not be found well i ve found her he moved towards the door his hat in his hand wait a moment just let me think i said so you diana and mary are my cousins we are your cousins yes he said waiting patiently as i looked at him it seemed i had found a brother and sisters to love and be proud of for the rest of my life the people who had saved my life were my close relations this was wealth indeed to a lonely heart brighter and more life giving than the heavy responsibility of coins and gold oh i m glad i m so glad i cried laughing st john smiled you were serious when i told you you had inherited a fortune now you re excited about something very unimportant what can you mean it may mean nothing to you you already have sisters and don t need any more family but i had nobody and now i suddenly have three relations in my world or two if you don t want to be counted i walked rapidly round the room my thoughts rising so fast i could hardly understand them the family i now had the people who had saved me from starvation i could now help them there were the four of us cousins twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand pounds each more than enough for each one of us it would be a fair and just arrangement and we would all be happy i would no longer have the worry of controlling a large amount of money and they would never have to work again we would all be able to spend more time together at moor house naturally when i made this suggestion to st john and his sisters they protested strongly and it was with great difficulty that i finally managed to convince them of my firm intention to carry out this plan in the end they agreed that it was a fair way of sharing the inheritance and so the legal steps were taken to transfer equal shares to all of us a voice from the past i promised to stay at morton school until christmas when st john would be able to find another teacher he was there when i closed the school for the christmas holidays i was quite sorry to have to say goodbye to some of my pupils you see what progress they have made and you ve only worked here a few months he said imagine how much more good you coul do if you gave your whole life to teaching yes i answered but i couldn t do it for ever don t mention school i m on holiday now he looked serious what are your plans i want you to let me have hannah for a few days she and i are going to clean moor house from top to bottom and make all the christmas preparations that you know nothing about being only a man everything must be ready for diana and mary when they come home next week for a really wonderful holiday st john smiled but he was still not satisfied with me that s all right for the moment but i hope jane that you ll look higher than domestic activity and think abut a better way of using your energy and intelligence in the service of god st john i have so many reasons for happiness i am determined to be happy despite your scolding that week hannah and i worked harder than we had ever worked in our lives before but at last all was ready it was a delight to see diana s and mary s faces when they arrived cold and stiff from their long journey and saw the warm fires and polished furniture and smelt the cakes and meat dishes cooking we three spent the whole of christmas week in perfect happiness the air of the moors the freedom of home and the beginning of independence made diana and mary happier than i had ever seen them only st john remained apart from our conversations and laughter he continued his serious studies and spent much time visiting the sick as usual do you still intend to be a missionary diana asked him once a little sadly nothing has changed or will change my plans he answered i shall leave england in a few months time and rosamund oliver asked mary gently rosamund oliver is engaged to a mr granby a very suitable young man according to her father his face was calm i realized he had managed to overcome what he called his weakness gradually our life at moor house lost its holiday feeling and as we took up our usual habits and regular studies again st john sat with us more often sometimes i had the impression he was observing us one day when diana and mary were out and i was learning german he suddenly said to me i want you to learn hindustani instead of german i ll need it for my missionary work in india and you could help me to learn it by studying with me i ve chosen you because i ve noticed you have better powers of concentration than either of my sisters it seemed so important to him that i could not refuse and when his sisters returned they were surprised to find me learning hindustani with st john from now on we spent a lot of time together studying i had to work very hard to satisfy him under his influence however i felt i was losing my freedom to be myself i could no longer talk or laugh freely as i knew he only approved of serious moods and studies i fell under his freezing spell obeying all his commands without thinking one evening at bedtime as he kissed his sisters good night and was holding out his hand to shake mine as usual diana said laughing st john you aren t treating jane like one of the family you should kiss her too i was rather embarrassed but st john calmly kissed me and did so every evening after that i had not forgotten mr rochester in all these changes of home and fortune his name was written on my heart and would stay there as long as i lived not only had i written to ask mr briggs more about him i had also written twice to mrs fairfax but after i had waited in vain for six months i lost hope and felt low indeed diana said i looked ill and needed a holiday at the seaside but st john thought i ought to concentrate on more serious work and gave me even more hindustani exercises to do one day while he and i were walking on the moors he announced jane i ll be leaving in six weeks you re doing god s work he ll protect you i replied yes it seems strange to me that all my friends don t want to join me god offers a place in heaven to all who serve him what does your heart say to that jane my heart is silent my heart is silent i murmured then i must speak for it said the deep stern voice jane come with me to india as a missionary was it a call from god i felt as if i was under a terrible spell and i trembled afraid that i might not be able to escape oh st john don t choose me i begged but it was useless appealing to a man who always did what he believed to be his duty however unpleasant it was god intended you to be a missionary s wife he continued trust in him jane marry me for the service of god i can t do it st john i m not strong enough i cried the iron bars of a cage seemed to be closing in around me i ve seen how hard you can work jane you will be a great help to me with indian women and in indian schools i thought yes i could do that but i know that he doesn t love me and despite that he asks me to marry him so i said i m ready to go with you to india but as a sister not as a wife he shook his head you must see that s impossible no a sister could marry at any time and leave me i need a wife who will obey me in life and who will stay with me until death i trembled as i felt his power over me already i ll give my heart to good i said you don t want it as i looked at his stern face i knew i could go anywhere in the world with him as a colleague but i could never lose my freedom by marrying him i ll ask you again in a few days time he said and remember it isn t me you re refusing but god from then on his manner towards me was as cold as ice which caused me great pain i began to understand how if i were his wife this good religious man could soon kill me without feeling any guilt at all when he asked me again we were alone in the sitting room he put his hand on my head and spoke quietly in his deep sincere voice remember jane god calls us to work for him and will reward us for it say you will marry me and earn your place in heaven i admired and respected him and under his touch my mind was changing i was tempted to stop struggling against him as i had been tempted before in a different way by mr rochester the missionary gently held my hand i could resist his anger but not his gentleness i desperately wanted to do what was right if i felt certain i answered finally that god really wanted me to marry you i would agree my prayers are heard cried st john close together we stood waiting for a sign from heaven i was more excited than i had ever been before there was a total silence in the house and the room was full of moonlight suddenly my heart stopped beating and i heard a distant voice cry jane jane jane nothing more where did it come from it was the voice of edward rochester and it spoke in sadness and in pain i m coming i cried wait for me i ran into the garden calling where are you only the hills sent a faint echo back i broke away from st john who had followed asking me questions it was my time to give orders now i told him to leave me and he obeyed in my room i fell to my knees to thank god for the sign he had sent me and waited eagerly for daylight returning to thornfield in the morning i explained to diana and mary that i had to go on a journey and would be away for several days although they did not know the reason for my journey they were far too sensitive to my feelings to bother me with questions and so i walked to whitcross the lonely crossroads on the moor where i had arrived a year ago with no money or luggage i took the coach and after thirty six hours of travelling i got down at thornfield village and almost ran across the fields in my hurry to see the well known house again and its owner i decided to approach from the front to get the best view of the house from there i would be able to see my master s window he might even be walking in the gardens i thought and i could run to him touch him surely that wouldn t hurt anybody but when i reached the great stone columns of the main gate i stood still in horror there where i had hoped to see a fine impressive house was nothing but a blackened heap of stones with the silence of death about it no wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer there must have been a great fire how had it started had any lives been lost i ran back to the village to find answers to my questions well ma am the hotel owner told me i was one of mr rochester s servants at the time and i can tell you it was his mad wife who started the fire in the governess s room the master had been wildly in love with the governess you see ma am although she was just a plain little thing and when she disappeared he almost went mad his wife must have understood enough to be jealous of the girl anyway in the fire the master risked his life helping all the servants out of the house then bravely went back to save the mad woman we saw her jump from the roof and fall to her death but because he went back to help her he was badly injured in the fire losing a hand and the sight of both eyes very sad ma am where is he now i asked urgently at another house of his ferndean manor thirty miles away i hired a carriage to drive there at once finding mr rochester again ferndean manor was a large old house in the middle of a wood it looked dark and lonely surrounded by trees as i approached the narrow front door opened and out came a figure i could not fail to recognize edward rochester i held my breath as i watched feeling a mixture of happiness and sadness he looked as strong as before and his hair was still black but in his face i saw a bitter desperate look that i had never seen there before he walked slowly and hesitatingly along the path although he kept looking up eagerly at the sky it was obvious that he could see nothing after a while he stopped and stood quietly there the rain falling fast on his bent uncovered head finally he found his way painfully back to the house and closed the door when i knocked at the door mr rochester s old servant john opened it and recognized me he and his wife mary were the only servants their master had wanted to keep when he moved from thornfield although they were surprised to see me i had no difficulty in arranging to stay at ferndean that night but he may not want to see you warned mary as we sat together in the kitchen he refuses to see anybody except us she was lighting some candles he always wants candles in the sitting room when it s dark even though he s blind give them to me mary i said i ll take them to him the blind man was sitting near the neglected fire in the dark room put down the candles mary he sighed here they are sir i said that is mary isn t it he asked listening carefully mary s in the kitchen i answered what sweet madness has seized me he cried suddenly where is the speaker i can t see but i must feel or my heart will stop and my brain will burst let me touch you or i can t live i held his wandering band with both of mine is it jane this is her shape he released his hand and seized my arm shouldter neck waist and held me close to him she is here i said and her heart too i am jane eyre i ve found you and come back to you my living darling so you aren t lying dead in a ditch somewhere is it a dream i ve dreamed so often of you only to wake in the morning abandoned my life dark my soul thirsty i m alive and i m not a dream in fact i m an independent woman now i ve inherited five thousand pounds from my uncle ah that sounds real i couldn t dream that but perhaps you have friends now and don t want to spend much time in a lonely house with a blind man like me i can do what i like and i intend to stay with you unless you object i ll be your neighbour your nurse your housekeeper your companion you will never be sad or lonely as long as i live he did not reply immediately and i was a little embarrassed by his silence i had assumed he would still want me to be his wife and wondered why he did not ask me jane he said sadly you cannot always be my nurse it s kind and generous of you but you re young and one day you will want to marry if i could only see i d try to make you love me again but and he sighed deeply i was very relieved to discover that was all he was worrying about because i knew that his blindness made no difference at all to my love for him however i thought too much excitement was not good for him so i talked of other things and made him laugh a little as we separated at bedtime he asked me just one thing jane were there only ladies in the house where you ve been i laughed and escaped upstairs still laughing a good idea i thought a little jealousy will stop him feeling so sorry for himself next day i took him outside for a long walk in the fresh air i described the beauty of the fields and sky to him as we sat close together in the shade of a tree tell me jane what happened to you when you so cruelly abandoned me he asked holding me tightly in his arms and so i told him my story naturally he was interested in st john rivers my cousin this st john do you like him he s a very good man i couldn t help liking him he s perhaps a man of fifty or so st john is only twenty nine sir rather stupid i think you said not at all intelligent he has an excellent brain sir did you say he was rather plain ugly in fact st john is a handsome man tall and fair with blue eyes mr rochester frowned and swore loudly in fact sir i continued he asked me to marry him well jane leave me and go oh until now i with thought you would never love another man but go and marry rivers i can never marry him sir he doesn t love me and i don t love him he s good and great but as cold as ice you needn t be jealous sir all my heart is yours he kisseed me i m no better than the great tree hit by lightning at thornfierld he said i can t expect to have a fresh young plant like you by my side all my life you are still strong sir and young plants need the strength and safety of a tree to support them jane will you marry me a poor blind man with one hand twenty years older than you yes sir my darling we ll be married in three days time jane thank god you know i never thought much of religion well lately i ve begun to understand that god has been punishing me for my pride and my past wickedness last monday night in a mood of deep depression i was sitting by an open window praying for a little peace and happiness in my dark life in my heart and soul i wanted you i cried out jane three times last monday night about midnight i asked wondering yes but that doesn t matter this is what s really strange i heard a voice calling i m coming wait for me and where are you and then i heard an echo sent back by hills but there s no echo here in the middle of the wood jane you must have been asleep your spirit and mine must have met to comfort each other it was your voice i heard i did not tell him i had actually spoken those words many miles away at that exact moment on that night because i could hardly understand how it happened myself i thank god said edward rochester and ask him to help me live a better life in future together we returned slowly to ferndean manor edward leaning on my shoulder we had a quiet wedding i wrote to tell the rivers the news diana and mary wrote back with delighted congratulations but st john did not reply now i have been married for ten years i know what it is like to love and be loved no woman has ever been closer to her husband than i am to edward i am my husband s life and he is mine we are always together and have never had enough of each other s company after two years his sight began to return in one eye now he can see a little and when our first child was born and put into his arms he was able to see that the boy had inherited his fine large black eyes mrs fairfax is retired and adele has grown into a charming young woman diana and mary are both married and we visit them once a year st john achieved his ambition by going to india as planned and is still there he writes to me regularly he is unmarried and will never marry now he knows that the end of his life is near but he has no fear of death and looks forward to gaining his place in heaven the bennets new neighbour it is a truth well known to all the world that an unmarried man in possession of a large fortune must be in need of a wife and when such a man moves into a neighbourhood even if nothing is known about his feelings or opinions this truth is so clear to the surrounding families that they think of him immediately as the future husband of one or other of their daughters my dear mr bennet said mrs bennet to her husband one day have you heard that someone is going to rent netherfield park at last no mrs bennet i haven t said her husband don t you want to know who is renting it cried mrs bennet impatiently you want to tell me and i don t mind listening mrs bennet needed no further encouragement well my dear i hear that he s a very rich young man from the north of england it seems he came to see netherfield on monday and was so delighted with it that he arranged to rent it at once of course it is the finest house in the area with the largest gardens his servants will be here by the end of the week and he will be arriving soon afterwards what is his name asked mr bennet bingley is he married or single oh single my dear of course a single man of large fortune he has an income of four or five thousand pounds a year how wonderdul for our girls why how can it affect them mr bennet asked my dear mr bennet she replied how can you be so annoying you must realize i m thinking of his marrying one of our daughters is that his purpose in coming to the area his purpose no of course not but it s very likely that he ll fall in love with one of them and i want him to see the girls as soon as possible before our other neighbours introduce themselves so you must visit him as soon as he arrives i really don t see why i should said mr bennet you and the girls can visit him or perhaps you should send them by themselves yes that might be better as you re as attractive as any of them and mr bingley might like you best my dear you flatter me replied his wife i certainly have been called beautiful in the past but i think a woman with five adult daughters should stop thinking of her own beauty mr bennet i beg you to visit him you know it s correct for the gentleman of the family to visit new neighbours first i simply cannot take the girls to see him unless you have already met him surely you worry too much about the rules of polite society i m sure mr bingley will be delighted to see you all and i ll write him a few lines which you can give him agreeing gladly to his marrying any of the girls although i must especially recommend my dear little lizzy oh no mr bennet gasped mrs bennet horrified please don t do that and lizzy is no better than the others although i know she is your favourite our daughters are all very silly ignorant girls it s true but at least lizzy is a little more intelligent than her sisters mr bennet how can you speak so unkindly of your own children oh dear how ill i feel have you no pity for me don t you realize how i suffer indeed my dear i ve suffered with you for the last twentythree years but i think you will recover and live to see many more rich young men come into the neighbourhood when he was young mr bennet had made the mistake of falling in love with a pretty but foolish young woman during the long years of their marriage he had had time to regret his mistake he soon realized that his wife had little intelligence or common sense and was only interested in talking shopping and finding husbands for her daughters his experience had made him rather bitter and he could not stop himself mocking his wife who never understood her husband s sense of humour so when a week later mrs bennet discovered that her husband had in fact visited mr bingley at netherfield she was surprised and very pleased but she and her daughters tried in vain to persuade mr bennet to describe the wealthy stranger and in the end they had to rely on another neighbour s description he sounds wonderful mama cried lydia the youngest and noisiest of the sisters charlotte lucas s father has been to see him and says he s quite young very handsome and extremely charming and even better he loves dancing everybody knows that means he s very likely to fall in love as politeness required mr bingley came to visit mr bennet a few days later he was not however fortunate enough to see the bennet girls who were hiding behind the curtains in an upstairs room in order to catch sight of the handsome stranger mrs bennet planned to invite him to dinner but in fact they met him at another social event first the bennets lived in the small hertfordshire village of longbourn and public dances were regularly held in the nearest town meryton the girls were greatly looking forward to this particular dance because they had heard that mr bingley would be attending with a group of friends from london on the night of the dance all eyes were on mr bingley as he entered the room he had brought his two sisters with the husband of the elder mr hurst and another young man mrdarcy mr bingley was indeed good looking and gentlemanlike and his sisters were fine fashionable women however everybody was soon talking about mr darcy a tall handsome man who it was said had an income of ten thousand pounds a year the ladies in the room gazed at him in admiration for about half the evening until they became aware of his constant frown and his unwillingness to talk or dance then there was general agreement that he was proud and disagreeable and considered himself superior to country people mr bingley on the other hand made himself popular with the ladles by dancing every dance and talking to everybody as there were not as many gentlemen as ladies elizabeth bennet did not have a partner for one of the dances and was sitting watching the dancing mr darcy was standing near her and when mr bingley came up to speak to his friend elizabeth could not avoid hearing their conversation come darcy said bingley i hate to see you looking so cross why don t you dance with one of these lovely girls certainly not replied darcy you know how i hate dancing with a partner i don t know i would particularly dislike it at a village dance like this apart from your sisters there isn t a woman in the room i would even consider dancing with you are dancing with the only attractive girl here he was looking at mrs bennet s eldest daughter jane who was waiting for bingley to join her for the next dance oh yes she s the most beautiful creature i ve ever seen but just behind you is one of her sisters she s very pretty and i m sure she s very pleasant my partner could introduce you who do you mean and darcy turned to look at elizabeth for a moment no he said coldly she s not attractive enough to tempt me go back to your partner bingley this conversation did not endear mr darcy to elizabeth but she told the story very cheerfully and amusingly to her friends the evening passed very happily for everybody else and mrs bennet was delighted with the effect her eldest daughter had had on mr bingley he danced with jane twice she told her husband later he danced with all the others only once and he really is so handsome but his friend mr darcy was so rude to poor elizabeth luckily she doesn t care she wouldn t want to please him such a horrible proud man i simply hate him when jane and elizabeth were alone they discussed their dancing partners i was really very flattered when mr bingley asked me to dance a second time said jane blushing i didn t expect it at all didn t you said elizabeth i did dear jane you were five times prettier than any other woman in the room but you re too modest ever to expect admiration i have to admit that i liked mr bingley continued jane in her gentle voice he s so good mannered and agreeable he s also handsome added her sister which makes his character quite perfect but what did you think of his sisters very pleasant when you get to know them the younger miss caroline bingley will be living at netherfield with her brother i m sure we ll enjoy having her as a neighbour elizabeth listened in silence she was not convinced jane is so kind she thought always ready to see the good side of people s characters i considered mr bingley s sisters too proud almost rude in fact i m sure they feel superior to most other people like mr darcy but she did not say any more after the dance the bennet and bingley families began to visit each other every few days it became evident that mr bingley admired jane very much and elizabeth knew that her sister was close to falling in love with him she was discussing this with her good friend charlotte lucas one day charlotte was a sensible intelligent young woman of twenty seven the eldest daughter of sir william and lady lucas who were neighbours of the bennet family it s a good thing said elizabeth that if jane is in love with mr bingley nobody will know because she always behaves so cheerfully and normally that s sometimes a mistake replied charlotte shaking her head wisely if she doesn t show her feelings at all even to the man she loves she may lose the opportunity of catching him jane should use every moment she gets with bingley to attract and encourage him but i consider a man should try to discover a woman s feelings not wait for her encouragement and jane probably doesn t know what her real feelings for bingley are yet she has only seen him a few times not often enough to understand his character or be sure that she really loves him well i wish jane success with all my heart said charlotte finally but i think she d have as much chance of happiness if she married him tomorrow as if she studied his character for a whole year happiness in marriage is simply a question of chance i think it s better to know as little as possible about the person you re going to spend your life with elizabeth laughed sure that charlotte did not mean what she was saying while observing mr bingley s interest in jane however elizabeth had not noticed mr darcy s interest in herself although at first he had not even considered her pretty he now began to realize what a beautiful expression her dark eyes gave to her intelligent face and what an attractive figure she had of course she is only an unfashionable village girl he told himself but her conversation is often quite amusing whenever they met he did not speak to her but stood near her listening to her and watching her closely conscious of a wish to know her better one evening at a party at the lucases house darcy was standing alone as usual away from the other guests watching the dancing his host sir william came to speak to him mr darcy are you enjoying the dancing sir what a delightful entertainment it is darcy frowned yes he said with cool disdain it s something that any uneducated person can be good at i m sure you re good at dancing yourself sir replied sir william cheerfully look here s miss elizabeth bennet she was crossing the room at that moment let me persuade you to dance with her you cannot refuse to dance when so much beauty is in front of you indeed sir replied elizabeth quickly in some embarrassment i have no intention of dancing you must excuse me miss bennet please allow me the pleasure of dancing with you said mr darcy politely holding out his hand but with equal politeness elizabeth refused again and turned away mr darcy was watching her walk away with a slight smile on his face when caroline bingley came up to him mr darcy she said i m sure i know what you re thinking how boring all these silly little country people are not at all miss bingley in fact i was just thinking what pleasure a pair of fine eyes can give really and who do these fine eyes belong to may i ask miss elizabeth bennet well let me be the first to congratulate you mr darcy when will the wedding be ah that s what i expected you to say a lady s imagination jumps from admiration to love to marriage in a moment well of course when you re married you will often have her charming mother and sisters to stay how delightful for you and miss bingley seeing that darcy remained calm continued to mock the bennet family as amusingly as she could jane s illness mr bennet had a comfortable income of two thousand a year and a pleasant house in longbourn but unfortunately for his daughters after his death all his property would pass to a distant male relation mrs bennet s father had been a lawyer and had only left his daughter a small amount of money she had a brother who owned shops in london and she also had a sister married to a mr philips he had been her father s clerk and now carried on his late employer s business mr and mrs philips lived in meryton which was only a kilometre or so from the village of longbourn it was a most convenient distance for the bennet girls who were usually tempted there three or four times a week to visit their aunt or a dressmaker who lived opposite the youngest daughters kitty and lydia were particularly regular visitors their minds were more vacant than their sisters and if no better entertainment was available a walk to meryton always provided some amusement as well as interesting local news from their aunt the latest news which delighted kitty and lydia was that the regiment which had recently arrived in meryton was to stay there for the whole winter the two girls now visited their aunt every day and as mr philips knew all the officers kitty and lydia were soon introduced to them at home they could talk of nothing but officers and their handsome uniforms even mr bingley s fortune now seemed hardly worth considering after listening to their praise of the officers one morning mr bennet said coolly from what i can see you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i ve suspected it for some time but now i m convinced kitty was embarrassed and did not reply but lydia the youngest continued to express her admiration for a certain captain carter with perfect indifference i am very surprised my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly as it happens they are all very clever that is the only point i think on which we do not agree i am afraid i must say that i consider our two youngest daughters unusually foolish my dear mr bennet you mustn t expect such young girls to have the common sense of their father or mother i remember when i used to like a red coat myself and indeed i still do if a good looking officer with five or six thousand a year wanted to marry one of my girls i wouldn t turn him down and i thought colonel forster looked very handsome last night at sir william s in his regimental uniform just then a servant entered with a note for jane which had come from netherfield mrs bennet s eyes shone with pleasure and she called out eagerly while her daughter was reading it well jane who is it from what does he say tell us tell us quickly my love it s from miss bingley said jane she invites me to dinner at netherfield as she and her sister are alone it seems her brother and the gentlemen are having dinner with the officers in meryton with the officers cried lydia i wonder why aunt philips didn t tell us that having dinner in meryton repeated mrs bennet shaking her head that s very unlucky may i take the carriage asked jane no my dear you d better ride over there because it looks likely to rain and then you ll have to stay the night that would be a good plan said elizabeth to her mother if you were sure they wouldn t offer to send her home in their carriage oh but they can t the gentlemen must have taken mr bingley s carriage to go to meryton i d much rather go in the carriage jane said but my dear your father can t spare the horses i m sure they re needed on the farm aren t they mr bennet mr bennet finally agreed that they were in fact being used that day in the fields so jane set out on her horse while her mother called cheerfully after her i do hope it ll rain heavily my love and jane had not been gone for long before it rained hard elizabeth was a little worried about her sister but mrs bennet was delighted what a good idea of mine that was she said more than once extremely pleased with herself not until the next morning however did she realize the full extent of her success after breakfast a servant from netherfield arrived with a note from jane to elizabeth explaining that jane had caught cold on her wet ride and had been invited to stay at netherfield until she recovered well my dear said mr bennet if your daughter should become seriously ill and die it would be a comfort to know that she died in a good cause and in obedience to your orders oh i m not afraid of her dying people don t die of colds she ll be looked after well at netherfield as long as she stays there everything will be all right but elizabeth felt really anxious and was determined to go to her sister as the carriage was not available and she was not keen on riding she decided to walk the five kilometres to netherfield kitty and lydia accompanied her as far as meryton where they went to visit one of the officers wives elizabeth continued alone crossing field after field and jumping impatiently over streams in her anxiety to see her sister when she arrived at netherfield with tired feet muddy stockings and a face healthily pink with exercise she was shown straight into the sitting room the two sisters miss bingley and mrs hurst could hardly believe that she had come so far alone and on foot in such bad weather but they received her politely their brother however was more than polite he was kind and considerate towards her mr darcy said very little hesitating between admiration of her healthy good looks and doubt whether she should have come such a distance alone mr hurst said nothing at all as he was thinking only of his breakfast elizabeth was glad to be taken almost immediately to her sister s room where she found jane delighted to see her but very feverish and unwell the doctor came and after examining his patient advised that she should stay in bed and take some medicine elizabeth stayed with her all day looking after her and the bingley sisters also spent some time in the patient s room however in the afternoon when it was time for elizabeth to leave jane seemed so upset that miss bingley was obliged to invite elizabeth to stay at netherfield for the present and a servant was sent to longbourn to inform the bennet family and bring back some clothes that evening elizabeth went down to dinner leaving jane in bed in her room she noticed the bingley sisters apparent concern for jane change to indifference in a few moments and knew she had been right to dislike them at first sight mr bingley indeed was the only one of the group whose behaviour she was satisfied with his anxiety for jane was evident and his politeness towards herself most pleasing but the others she felt treated her as an unwelcome guest miss bingley was concentrating all her attention on mr darcy and mrs hurst also joined in their conversation while mr hurst was only interested in eating drinking and playing cards when elizabeth left the room after dinner to see if jane needed anything miss bingley at once began to criticize her what bad manners she has she s both proud and lacking in politeness to her superiors she has no conversation no elegance and no beauty mrs hurst agreed and added she has no good qualities except that she s an excellent walker i ll never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa how silly of her to come at all why must she run around the countryside just because her sister has a cold her hair looked so untidy and her dress simply covereb in mud i must say said bingley i didn t notice any of that i thought she looked remarkably attractive when she arrived this morning you observed her wild appearance i m sure mr darcy said miss bingley and i imagine you wouldn t wish your sister to make such a show of herself certainly not walking four or five kilometres whatever it was up to her ankles in mud and alone quite alone it seems to me to show a dreadful sort of independence a country girl s indifference to what is acceptable i think it shows a very pleasing affection for her sister said bingley i m afraid mr darcy whispered miss bingley that this adventure has rather lessened your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise after a short pause mrs hurst began again i have a great liking for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well married but with such a father and mother and with such vulgar relations i m afraid there s no chance of it i think the bennet girls have an uncle who s a lawyer in meryton yes and they have another who owns shops in cheapside such a nice part of london both the sisters laughed if they had enough uncles to fill cheapside cried bingley it wouldn t make them any less charming but it must considerably lessen their chances of marrying men of any position in the world replied darcy bingley did not answer but his sisters agreed enthusiastically and continued mocking their dear friend s vulgar relations for some time late in the evening when elizabeth was satisfied that jane was asleep she felt she ought to go downstairs again she found the party in the sitting room playing cards but although they invited her to join in their game she refused politely and picked up a book to read i can fetch you more books to read if you wish offered bingley but i m afraid i haven t got a large library unlike you i m too lazy to spend much time reading what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy said miss bingley and what a beautiful house it is charles when you buy your house i hope it will be even half as lovely as pemberley i hope so too agreed bingley and your dear sister mr darcy i expect she s grown since the spring i want so much to see her again i ve never met anyone who delighted me so much such an appearance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age i m always surprised said bingley to find how very accomplished all young ladies are how do they have the time and patience to learn all these skills certainly people use the word accomplished too loosely said darcy but i am far from agreeing with you about ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than six who are really accomplished then said elizabeth your idea of an accomplished woman must include a great many qualities yes a great many oh certainly cried his faithful assistant miss bingley an accomplished woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and modern languages and besides this a certain something in her manner of walking in her voice and in her behaviour all this she must possess added darcy and something more solid the improvement of her mind by wide reading i m no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women said elizabeth i rather wonder at your knowing any i ve never seen such elegance and intelligence and knowledge as you describe in one woman mrs hurst and miss bingley were both protesting loudly that they knew many women like this when mr hurst called their attention back to the card game as this meant an end to the conversation elizabeth soon afterwards left the room miss elizabeth bennet said miss bingley to darcy is one of those women who try to appear attractive to men by undervaluing other women i think that s a mean trick it is true said darcy that there is meanness in all the tricks used by ladies to attract men miss bingley was not satisfied enough with this answer to continue the conversation the next morning elizabeth was glad to be able to inform mr bingley and his sisters that jane was very much better in spite of this improvement however she asked for her mother to be sent for as she wanted mrs bennet s opinion of jane s state of health soon after breakfast therefore mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest daughters reached netherfield elizabeth although relieved to hear that her mother did not think jane s illness serious began to regret asking her to come when she saw the bingley sisters smiling at mrs bennet s remarks elizabeth blushed for her mother who could not help showing her lack of intelligence and common sense in everything she said kitty and lydia made an equally had impression they had been whispering together when suddenly lydia who was an attractive confident well grown girl of fifteen pushed herself rudely forward she begged mr bingley to hold a ball at netherfield with his usual politeness mr bingley promised he would but elizabeth saw his sisters exchanging meaningful glances she was quite glad when her mother and sisters left she and jane were to stay another night at netherfield to allow jane to recover completely that evening elizabeth appeared again in the sitting room she could not avoid noticing how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her but as she felt sure that so great a man could not possibly admire her she assumed that when he looked at her he was criticizing her in some way this thought did not cause her any pain as she liked him too little to care for his approval in the conversations she had with him she spoke in her usual slightly mocking manner rather expecting to offend him but was surprised by the quiet politeness of his replies darcy had never before been so charmed by any woman he really believed that if she did not have such vulgar relations he might be in danger of falling in love with her miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane was increased by her wish to get rid of elizabeth fortunately perhaps for almost everyone at netherfield elizabeth and her sister who was now quite recovered were returning home the next day only mr bingley showed real sorrow at this and was concerned that jane might not be fit enough to travel mr darcy was quite relieved and determined that no sign of admiration for elizabeth should escape him now miss bingley s politeness to elizabeth as well as her affection for jane increased rapidly as the moment of departure approached and she was able to say goodbye to them with many warm expressions of friendliness and a promise to visit them very soon mr bennet was glad to welcome his eldest daughters home again as he had felt their absence from the family circle but mrs bennet who had hoped they would stay much longer was quite disappointed to see them come back in such a short time mr collins visits longbourn i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife at breakfast the next morning that you have told the cook to send up a good dinner today as i am expecting a visitor who is it my dear i know of nobody who is coming unless charlotte lucas happens to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her the person i m talking about is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennet s eyes shone with excitement it s mr bingley i m sure why jane you never mentioned it well i ll be extremely glad to see him lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to the cook at once it is not mr bingley said her husband it s a person whom i have never seen before this caused general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters all at the same time having amused himself for some time with their curiosity he finally explained i have recently received a letter from my cousin mr collins who as you know will inherit all my property when i die and may throw you out of this house as soon as he wants oh my dear cried his wife please don t mention that hateful man it s the hardest thing in the world to accept the fact that your property is not left to your own children and i m sure if i were you i d have tried to do something about it jane and elizabeth tried to explain the legal situation to her again they had often attempted to do this before but it was a matter which mrs bennet refused to understand and she continued to complain bitterly about mr collins it certainly is most unjust agreed mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting this house but if you listen while i read his letter to you you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself he read aloud the following letter dear sir the disagreement between you and my late respected father always worried me and since his death i have frequently wished to improve the relationship between our families after a long period of study and training i have recently become a priest and have been fortunate enough to gain the patronage of lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh this generous lady has given me the post of rector at hunsford which was luckily vacant hunsford is the village near her own large country house in kent here i carry out the duties of my profession whenever necessary and i take great care to behave at all times with grateful respect towards her ladyship as a priest moreover i feel it my duty to encourage all families in my area of influence to live peacefully because of this i flatter myself that i am acting correctly in offering you my friendship i am of course concerned that when i eventually inherit all your property your daughters will doubtless be very poor and i do apologize for this i promise you i am ready to make amends in every possible way but more about this later if you do not object i propose to visit you and your family on monday november th at four o clock and shall probably stay until the following saturday week this will cause me no inconvenience at all as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence from my duties i remain dear sir with respectful good wishes to your lady and your daughters your friend william collins so we can expect this peace making gentleman at four o clock today said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he appears to be a most polite and serious young man how considerate of lady catherine to allow him to visit us well if he is ready to make amends to the girls in some way i shall certainly not discourage him said mrs bennet although it s difficult said jane to guess how he intends to do that it s good of him to want to help us i think he s peculiar said elizabeth he sounds too pleased with himself and he speaks so politely of lady catherine and why does he apologize for inheriting father s property in future we know it s not his fault can he be a sensible man sir she added turning to mr bennet no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the opposite there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises to be entertaining i am impatient to see him mary the middle daughter who spent most of her time reading and who seldom joined in family conversations now remarked that in her opinion his letter was well expressed but kitty and lydia did not show any interest in the letter or its writer as it was highly unlikely that their cousin would arrive in a regimental uniform they could not imagine having any pleasure in meeting him their mother however had changed her attitude towards mr collins after his letter and was now preparing to meet him with such calmness that it astonished her husband and daughters mr collins arrived punctually and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins did not seem in need of encouragement he was a tall heavylooking young man of twenty five his expression was serious and his manners very formal soon after his arrival he said to mrs bennet madam i must compliment you on having such a fine family of daughters i had heard much of their beauty but i find them even more beautiful than reports have stated i do not doubt you will see them all well married quite soon mrs bennet never quarrelled with compliments and she answered you re very kind sir and indeed i do hope so be cause otherwise they ll have nothing at all to live on you refer perhaps to my inheriting the bennet property ah yes sir i do you must confess it is a sad business for my poor girls i am very aware madam of the hardship to your lovely daughters and could say more about this but i am cautious of saying too much too soon but i would like to say that i have come prepared to admire the young ladies and perhaps when we know each other better the bell rang for dinner and the family moved into the dining room with their guest the girls smiled secretly at each other as mr collins praised the hall the dining room and all the furniture mrs bennet would normally have been delighted with such praise but she could not help thinking that he was perhaps admiring it all as his future property the dinner too he considered excellent and he asked which of his charming cousins was responsible for it but mrs bennet explained quite sharply to him that they were very well able to afford a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged her pardon immediately for offending her and continned to apologize for about a quarter of an hour mr bennet had hardly spoken up to now but he thought it was time to enter the conversation you seem very fortunate in your patron mr collins he said he could not have chosen a better opening remark mr collins spoke enthusiastically for several minutes in praise of lady catherine never in my life have i witnessed such considerate behaviour in a person of high birth although she is such a great lady she has never treated me with disdain she talks to me almost as an equal and gives me advice for example she has recommended me to marry as soon as possible and do you know she has asked me to dinner twice at her house some people consider her proud but she has only ever been kind to me she even took the trouble to visit my small house and was thoughtful enough to suggest one or two improvements some shelves upstairs that is very correct and polite i m sure said mrs bennet does she live near you sir only a small country road separates my poor house from rosings park her ladyship s home i think you said she is a widow has she any family she has only one daughter who will inherit rosings and all lady catherine s property a most charming young lady unfortunately in weak health i often pay her some little compliment on her appearance or her accomplishments when i visit rosings lady catherine appreciates these compliments to her daughter and i see it as my duty to please her ladyship i am sure you re right said mr bennet no doubt you are expert at flattering with delicacy may i ask how you think of these pleasing compliments some of them come to me at the time but in my spare moments i do occasionally prepare a few words which may be suitable for different occasions mr bennet listened to his cousin with the greatest emjoyment mr collins was as foolish as he had hoped but by tea time mr bennet had had enough and after tea asked his guest to read aloud to the ladies however when a novel was handed to mr collins he looked shocked and protested that he never read novels he chose a religious book instead and started reading in a slow serious voice lydia could not hide her boredom for long and after only three pages she interrupted him rudely to ask her mother a question about one of the officers in meryton mr collins was offended and refused to read any more although mrs bennet and her other daughters apologized for lydia s lack of manners mr collins was not a sensible man and neither education nor society had improved him the respect he felt for his patron and his very good opinion of himself and his new position made him proud and servile at the same time now that he had a home and a considerable income he had decided to marry the bennet girls who would lose their inheritance because of him had a reputation for being attractive and charming and his idea of making amends to them was to marry one of them he considered this an excellent plan and thought himself extremely generous and unselfish in carrying it out he had known he was right when he arrived at longbourn and saw jane bennet s lovely face as the eldest she should marry first and for the first evening she was his choice but the next morning after a fifteen minute conversation with mrs bennet he had to change his mind when he explained that he was hoping to find a wife among her daughters she replied with a happy smile that her eldest daughter was very likely to be engaged soon but there are my other daughters mr collins she continued encouragingly mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was pouring the tea next to jane in birth and beauty elizabeth was the obvious choice mr bennet was delighted hoping that she might soon have two daughters married the man whom she had so disliked the day before was now a favourite with her elizabeth meets mr wickham when later that morning lydia suggested walking to meryton to see some of the officers all her sisters except mary agreed to accompany her even mr collins went with them encouraged by mr bennet who was by now most anxious to have some time to himself during their walk the girls listened politely to mr collins self important speeches but as soon as they entered meryton the younger ones no longer eved pretended to be interested in his conversation but looked eagerly around in search of the officers just then all the young ladies noticed a very gentleman like young man whom they had never seen before walking down the street with an officer they knew they were all wondering who the handsome stranger could be when the officer came up to them to greet them he asked permission to introduce his friend whose name was mr wickham and who had apparently arrived recently from london to become an officer in the regiment this was exactly as it should be because the young man only needed an officer s uniform to become completely charming he was very good looking with a very pleasant sociable manner and after the introductions conversation flowed most enjoyably in the little group they were still standing and talking happily together when they heard the sound of horses and saw darcy and bingley riding down the street the two gentlemen came straight towards the ladies to greet them bingley was clearly most interested in jane bennet and started talking particuarly to her darcy however was just determining not to look at elizabeth when he suddenly noticed the stranger by chance elizabeth saw darcy s and wickham s faces at the moment when they caught sight of each other and she was astonished at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one white the other red after a few moments mr wickham touched his hat and mr darcy nodded very slightly what could this mean it was impossible to imagine and it was impossible not to wish to know in another moment mr bingley who did not seem to have noticed what had happened said goodbye and rode away with mr darcy the two officers accompanied the young ladies to mrs philips house but did not go in in spite of lydia s repeated invitations mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and welcomed mr collins most politely when he was introduced to her she did not however have any more information for the girls about the agreeable mr wickham but i tell you what my dears she said brightly i m giving a little supper party for some of the officers tomorrow i ll ask mr philips to visit mr wickham and invite him to come too will you all come as well the girls were delighted and agreed at once to this arrangement and the whole group walked back to longbourn happily discussing the enjoyable evening they were going to have mr collins had been very impressed with mrs philips politeness and when they reached longbourn he complimented mrs bennet on her sister s elegance and charming manners the next evening the carriage took him and his five cousins to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the hall that mr wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was at that moment in the house when mr collins was shown into the sitting room and had time to look around and admire it he said immediately to mrs philips madam i must compliment you on the size and furniture of this room really i could almost imagine myself in the smaller summer breakfast room at rosings this remark did not at first please his hostess very much but when she heard from him what rosings was and who its owner was and how much lady latherine s furniture cost she realized what a great compliment it was during the evening mr collins found mrs philips a kind and attentive listener which was fortunate as the bennet girls could not bring themselves to listen to him any longer all the ladies were impatient to see mr wickham and when he came into the room he appeared far more charming and gentlemanly than any of the officers present he was the lucky man towards whom almost every female eye turned and elizabeth was the lucky woman beside whom he finally took his seat his pleasant way of making conversation made her feel that he could talk interestingly about anything as he did not play cards which some of the party were doing he stayed talking to elizabeth for a large part of the evening she hoped he would tell her how he knew mr darcy but she dared not mention that gentleman luckily however mr wickham himself began to talk about it although in a rather hesitating manner netherfield is quite near meryton i suppose how long has has mr darcy been staying there he has been there about a month replied elizabeth unwilling to let the matter drop she added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied wickham his income is ten thousand a year at least i know more about him than most people as i have been closely connected with his family since childhood elizabeth could only look surprised you might well be surprised miss bennet at my saying that after noticing as you probably did the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday do you know mr darcy well as well as i ever wish to cried elizabeth i ve spent four days in the same house as him and i consider him very disagreeable i ve known him too long and too well to judge fairly whether he s disagreeable or not but i believe most people would be astonished by your opinion he is not at all liked here in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you won t find him praised by anyone i can t pretend to be sorry that he is valued as he deserves but with him i believe it doesn t often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and importance or frightened by his proud behaviour and sees him only as he chooses to be seen after a pause wickham added i wonder if he s likely to stay at netherfield much longer i don t know at all but i hope his presence won t stop you becoming an officer in the regiment here oh no i won t be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go the reason i have for avoiding him is one i could easily make public to the whole world he has treated me very badly his late father miss bennet was one of the best men who ever lived and the most faithful friend i ever had and whenever i m with this mr darcy i think of his father with the most painful regret mr darcy has behaved wickedly to wards me but i could forgive him anything except the insult to his father s memory elizabeth was fascinated and listened eagerly but did not like to ask any questions mr wickham began to speak more generally about meryton and the charming people he had met there in fact that s why i was tempted to join the regiment i d heard that meryton society is most agreeable society i confess is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man you see i did not intend to join the army at all the church ought to have been my profession and i should at this moment have a comfortable income as a derbyshire rector if the gentleman we were speaking of just now had wished it indeed yes mr darcy s father had always been very fond of me and intended to give me the post of rector of pemberley but unfortunately after his death when the post became vacant it was given to someone else no cried elizabeth horrified but how could that happen why didn t you get legal advice and claim what was rightfully yours mr darcy s father had not stated his wish in writing a man of honour could not have doubted his intention but mr darcy chose to treat it as a recommendation only i really can not accuse myself of having done anything to deserve to lose the post the fact is he hates me i think he was jealous of his father s affection for me which annoyed him from the beginning this is very shocking i hadn t thought mr darcy as bad as this although i ve never liked him i assumed he felt superior to everyone else but did not suspect him of behaving in such a wicked unjust inhuman way we grew up together at pemberley you know my father gave up all his time to take care of the pemberley farms and was greatly appreciated as a close friend by the late mr darcy who promised just before my father s death to provide for me the present mr darcy did not choose to respect that promise how strange that mr darcy s pride has not made him help you surely he s too proud to wish to appear dishonestwhich is what i must call him he s certainly very proud proud of his position his family his father and his sister too you know what sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head it gives me pain to criticize a darcy but she s too much like her brother very very proud she s a handsome girl of about fifteen or sixteen and i understand extremely accomplished i am astonished at mr darcy s close friendship with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems so charming and kind be friendly with such a man i don t know mr bingley at all but mr darcy can be a pleasant companion if he thinks it worthwhile just then they were joined by some of the others and the conversation became more general when mr collins was talking to mrs philips about his patron mf wickham looked quickly in his direction and then asked elizabeth does your cousin know lady catherine de bourgh very well i don t think he has known her for long but she has recently given him the post of rector of hunsford perhaps you know that lady catherine is the present mr darcy s aunt i believe she is planning to marry herdaughter who will inherit a fortune to mr darcy this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley s efforts to attract mr darcy which might all be in vain the supper party came to an end and elizabeth went away with her head full of mr wickham she could think of nothing but him and what he had told her all the way home the next day she told jane everything she had discussed with mr wickham jane listened with astonishment and concern she could not believe that mr darcy could so little deserve mr bingley s friendship and yet she did not want to doubt the truthfulness of such an agreeable young man as mr wickham elizabeth however felt sure that mr darcy was to blame that morning an invitation arrived at longbourn mr bingley had fixed the date for the ball he had promised to give at netherfield and it was to be on the following tuesday every female in the bennet family was looking forward to it even mary who lifted her head from her book to say unsmiling as long as i have my mornings free for serious reading i do not mind meeting people in the evenings i consider some relaxation and amusement is good for everybdy elizabeth felt so cheerful at the thought of dancing with mr wickham that she made an unusual effort to speak kindly to mr collins will you accept mr bingley s invitation sir and if you do will you as a priest consider it right to dance i shall certainly accept and i am so far from objecting to dancing that i hope to have the honour of dancing with all my beautiful cousins i take this opportunity of asking you miss elizabeth for the first two dances especially she was very surprised and rather annoyed she had hoped that wickham would ask her for those dances but now she would have mr collins instead she could not refuse however and his request also worried her in another way his manner to her seemed particularly flattering which gave her the unwelcome idea that perhaps she had been chosen from among her sisters to be the rector of hunsford s wife as she observed the increasing number of compliments he paid to her beauty and character she felt sure that he intended to propose marriage for the moment however she decided to do nothing but wait and see on tuesday evening when elizabeth entered the hall at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the red coats gathered there she was surprised and disappointed to see he was not present she had never doubted he would come and had dressed with more than her usual care looking forward to winning his heart which she knew was already partly hers but she immediately suspected that darcy had persuaded bingley not to invite wicham and although she discovered from one of the officers that in fact wickham had been invited but had been called away on business she felt sure wickham had wanted to avoid meeting darcy and blamed darcy for this as a result when darcy greeted her she was so annoyed with him that she could hardly reply politely but she soon became more cheerful and determined to enjoy the ball in spite of wickham s absence unfortunately the first two dances with mr collins were painfully embarrassing as her cousin had no idea how to dance and moved extremely awkwardly she was relieved to leave him and have the third dance with an officer who gave her great pleasure by talking about wickham and his popularity in the regiment alter this she was very surprised to be approached by mr darcy and invited to dance she was so astonished in fact that she accepted him without thinking and found herself standing opposite him on the dance floor what an honour for me to be allowed to dance with mr darcy she thought they danced for some time in silence and then she made a remark he replied and was silent again after a pause she spoke again now pou must say something mr darcy you could remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled i ll say whatever you wish me to say very well that reply will do for the moment perhaps soon i ll observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we can be silent conversation needs to be arranged in this way so that those people who don t enjoy talking are not required to make any effort are you referring to yourself or are you thinking of me both said elizabeth smiling because i think you and iare similar we re both unsociable and unwilling to speak unless we can astonish and impress the whole room i am sure you aren t like that he answered i cannot say whether i am or not you obviously think so she said nothing do you and your sisters often go to meryton he continued we do she replied and unable to resist the temptation she added when you met us there last week we had just been introduced to someone the effect was immediate there was a new coldness in darcy s expression after a moment he said with difficulty mr wickham is so agreeable that he makes friends easily whether he can keep them is less certain he has been unlucky enough to lose your friendship replied elizabeth sharply and in a way which will cause him hardship all his life darcy did not reply to this and there was only time for a little more conversation before the dance ended elizabeth went to find jane and listened with delight as she described her feelings for bingley and her confidence in his affection for her but apart from jane it seemed to elizabeth that if her family had made an agreement to appear as stupid as possible during the ball they could not have been more successful first mr collins insisted on going to introduce himself to mr darcy the nephew of his respected patron and was received very coldly then during supper mrs bennet could not be prevented from talking very loudly to lady lucas about her great hopes of jane s marriage to bingley elizabeth blushed in embarrassment when she realized that the bingley sisters and mr darcy were able to hear finally when some music was required mary bennet went confidently to the piano and sang and played several songs all rather badly the rest of the evening brought elizabeth little amusement she could not even go and talk to people she knew as mr collins seemed determined to stay close by her side all evening fortunately her good friend charlotte lucas occasionally gave her some relief by kindly listening to some of mr collins long speeches at least elizabeth did not have to talk to mr darcy any more he often stood near her quite alone but did not come close enough to speak at the end of the evening it was obvious to elizabeth that although her family had greatly enjoyed the ball the bingley sisters were eager for these particular guests to leave mr collins however was enthusiastic in his praise of the bingleys hospitality and mrs bennet invited the whole bingley family to visit longbourn as soon as possible she was feeling very satisfied convinced that in three or four months jane would be married to bingley she was also sure that elizabeth would marry mr collins this was a good enough marriage for elizabeth who was her least favourite daughter but not nearly as impressive as jane s marriage to bingley mr collins proposes twice at longbourn the next day soon after breakfast mr collins asked mrs bennet for permission to speak privately to elizabeth mrs bennet was delighted and hurried the other girls out of the room so that elizabeth and mr collins were left alone together elizabeth did not want to stay and got up to leave but after a moment s thought sat down again quietly determined to listen and reply politely my dear miss elizabeth said mr collins seriously this little unwillingness to hear me this modesty of yours can only add to your other charms you can hardly doubt the purpose of my speech almost as soon as i entered the house i chose you as the companion of my future life but before i am carried away by my feelings i think i should state my reasons for marrying elizabeth was trying so hard not to laugh at the idea of mr collins being carried away by his feelings that she was unable to reply first he continued it is right for a priest to marry as an example to other people secondly i m sure marriage will add greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i should have mentioned earlier my generous patron has advised me to marry find an active useful sort of person she told me a woman who can make a small income go a long way bring her to hunsford as your wife and i ll visit her so i decided to choose a wife from among my bennet cousins to lessen the loss to the family when the sad event of your father s death takes place i flatter myself that you will appreciate my motives and now nothing remains but to convince you of the violence of my affection i am quite indifferent to the fact that you bring little money with you into our marringe and promise you that i shall make no ungenerous reference to this after we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now sir you forget i have given no answer accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me but it is impossible for me to accept your proposal of course i understand said mr collins that young ladies often do not accept a proposal of marriage the first time i am therefore not at all discouraged and sincerely hope we shall be married soon sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather extraordinary after what i ve said i am perfectly serious you could not make me happy and i m convinced i m the last woman in the world who would make you happy and i m sure that if lady catherine knew me she would find me poorly qualified for the situation if i knew lady catherine thought so began mr collins looking very worried but i cannot imagine she would disapprove of you and when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall certainly tell her how modest economical and practical you are indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary pay me the compliment of believing what i say i hope you will be very happy and very rich but i cannot accept your proposal she got up and was going to leave the room but mr collins was speaking to her again i am far from accusing you of cruelty in refusing me as i know it is the custom with elegant ladies in society to refuse a gentleman the first time i hope to receive a more favourable answer next time i speak to you of marriage really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you do puzzle me i do not know how to express my refusal so that it convinces you you must allow me to flatter myself dear cousin that you do not intend to refuse me for long my situation in life my connections with the de bourgh family and my relationship to your own all make my proposal a very suitable one and you should remember that in spite of your many admirable qualities it is not certain that you will receive any other offer of marriage as you have very little money of your own sir thank you again for the honour you have done me but to accept your proposal is absolutely impossible can i speak plainer than that don t think of me as an elegant female but as a thinking creature speaking the truth from her heart you are charming he cried and i m sure that when both your excellent parents agree you will accept my proposal elizabeth did not reply but left the room silently determined to ask her father if necessary to make her refusal clear to the self deceiving mr collins mrs bennet had been waiting eagerly for the end of the interview and when she saw elizabeth leave the room she hurried in to offer her congratulations to mr collins he received them with pleasure adding that he was sure his cousin s refusal was a natural result of her modesty and delicacy of character refusal repeated mrs bennet shocked lizzy refused you do not worry mr collins i shall speak to her at once she s a very obstinate foolish girl but i ll make her accept you pardon me madam cried mr collins but if she s really obstinate and foolish i do not think she would be a suitable wife for a man in my situation sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed she s only obstinate in a matter like this in everything else she is very agreeable i ll see mr bennet and we ll arrange it with her i m sure she did not give him time to reply but hurried to the library where she knew she would find her husband oh mr bennet we need you urgently we re all in such confusion you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and stared at her with calm unconcern i do not have the pleasure of understanding you he said what are you talking about lizzy declares she won t have him and if you don t hurry he ll change his mind and not have her so what should i do it seems a hopeless business speak to her about yourself tell her you insist on her marrying him call her in here she shall hear my opinion mrs bennet gladly rang the bell and the servant brought elizabeth into the library come here child said her father as she appeared i ve sent for you on a very important matter i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage and you have refused when elizabeth nodded he continued very well now your mother insists on your accepting isn t that right mrs bennet yes or i ll never see her again you now have an unhappy choice to make elizabeth from this day on you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not help smiling but mrs bennet who had been sure her husband supported her was very disappointed what do you mean mr bennet you promised me you would insist on her marrying him my dear replied her husband i have two small requests to make first that you will accept that i know what ipromised or did not promise and secondly that you will all leave me in peace as soon as possible that afternoon charlotte lucas came to visit elizabeth and found the family still in great confusion the younger girls were quite excited by the news of mr collins proposal and mrs bennet was most annoyed with elizabeth oh dear miss lucas cried mrs bennet can t you persuade elizabeth to accept mr collins nobody else wants to help me oh how ill i feel and look at lizzy now she s so unconcerned but i tell you miss lizzy if you go on refusing every offer of marriage like this you ll never get a husband at all and i won t be able to provide for you when your father is dead i warn you now i told you in the library that i wouldn t speak to you again and i won t i have no pleasure in talking to an undutiful child like you not that i have much pleasure in talking to anybody with my headaches nobody knows how i suffer but of course those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence aware that any attempt to calm her would only increase her annoyance elizabeth however was determined not to marry mr collins and in the end mrs bennet was obliged to accept that fact when mr collins realized that elizabeth had meant what she said his manner towards her became coldly and stiffly polite his long speeches and flattering compliments were transferred for the rest of the day to kind charlotte lucas who took on herself the trouble of listening to him for which all the bennets were very grateful the next day a letter was delivered to jane from netherfield elizabeth saw her sister s expression change as she read it and when they were alone she asked about it it s from caroline bingley said jane and it has surprised me very much the whole party have left netherfield and are on their way back to london probably for the winter they may not return to netherfield at all she says the only thing she sincerely regrets is leaving me behind in hertfordshire and promises to write very frequently elizabeth did not trust miss bingley s apparent affection for jane i really don t think their departure matters very much she said mr bingley won t be kept in london by his sisters i m sure he ll be back at netherfield soon but perhaps he prefers to stay in london where many of his friends are but i haven t told you everything yet let me read you the part which particularly hurts me mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and we confess we are also eager to see her again nobody is more beautiful elegant or accomplished than georgiana darcy louisa and i have great affection for her and hope one day to call her sister my brother admires her very much he will have frequent opportunities of seeing her and although i am his sister i must say i think he is most capable of winning any woman s heart what do you think of this dear lizzy isn t it clear enough caroline doesn t wish or expect me to become her sister inlaw she s convinced of her brother s indifference towards me and perhaps because she suspects my feelings for him she most kindly warns me that he s very likely to marry someone else i have a totally different opinion miss bingley sees her brother is in love with you while she wants him to marry miss darcy we aren t rich enough or grand enough for them and she is eager to have a family connection with the darcys so that it may be easier for her to marry mr darcy so she follows her brother to london hoping to keep him there and tries to persuade you he doesn t care about you but of course he s in love with you i really can t agree with you about caroline i think she s incapable of deceiving anyone but lizzy my dear sister even if she s wrong about her brother and he does care for me could i be happy in accepting a man whose sisters and friends all wish him to marry someone else you must decide for yourself and if you consider it more important to do what his sisters want than to gain the happiness of being his wife i certainly advise you to refuse him how can you say that said jane smiling a little you know i wouldn t hesitate although i d be sad if they disapproved of me but oh dear if he doesn t come back to netherfield i ll never have to make the decision but elizabeth was sure mr bingley could not be kept away from jane by his sisters and soon persuaded jane to take a more hopeful view of the situation that day the bennets with mr collins went to dinner with the lucas family at lucas lodge again it was charlotte who spent most of the evening listening to mr collins elizabeth was very relieved and thanked her friend gratefully for the trouble she was taking but charlotte s kindness had a particular aim which elizabeth was unaware of her plan was to encourage mr collins to transfer his attentions to herself in fact she was managing so well that when she said goodnight to him after dinner she would have felt sure of success if he had been staying in hertfordshire for another week but she did not fully appreciate the fire and independence of his character which caused him to get up very early the next morning and escape from longbourn house in a great hurry to reach lucas lodge and throw himself at her feet she did not keep him waiting for an answer and the happy couple found themselves engaged as quickly as mr collins long speeches would allow charlotte s parents were delighted to agree to the marriage and lady lucas began to work out with more interest than she had ever felt before how many more years mr bennet was likely to live charlotte herself was quite satisfied mr collins certainly was neither sensible nor agreeable but still he would be a husband she did not think highly of men or of marriage but she had always intended to marry although marriage might not always bring happiness it was the only honourable way in which a well educated woman with little income could provide a home for herself now twenty seven and lacking beauty she felt she was lucky to have found a husband she knew however that elizabeth whose friendship she greatly valued would be astonished and possibly disapproving so she decided to go to longbourn house to tell her friend the news herself elizabeth was indeed shocked at first and could not help crying out in surprise but when charlotte explained her reasons for accepting mr collins elizabeth tried hard to understand when the rest of the bennet family heard the news they were also astonished mrs bennet was quite horrified and could not stop complaining bitterly about charlotte s wickedness mr collins stupidity and elizabeth s obstinacy mr bennet was much calmer only saying he was pleased to discover that charlotte whom he used to consider quite sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daugh ter that day was mr collins last at longbourn and he left with many speeches of thanks as well as a promise to return very soon mr bennet warned him to be careful not to offend his patron by being absent from his duties too often but mr collins although extremely grateful for this sign of mr bennet s cousinly affection for him was naturally eager to return to hertfordshire to see his future wife only two weeks later he did in fact come back to stay at longbourn but spent most of his time at lucas lodge making arrangements for the wedding mrs bennet still felt very offended by him but she was now becoming anxious about something even more important mr bingley s continued absence day after day had passed with no news since the arrival of car oline bingley s letter elizabeth was now rather worried and jane feared the worst finally a second letter arrived from caroline bingley and when jane read it she realized that all hope was over the bingley family were staying in london for the whole winter and georgiana darcy was a frequent member of their circle miss bingley boasted joyfully of this friendship and looked forward to her brother s probable marriage to miss darcy although she was deeply upset jane bravely tried to control her feelings do not worry lizzy i shall be able to forget him in a while i have nothing to complain of as he made no promises to me i just thought he cared for me but i was wrong luckily no one is hurt except myself my dear jane said elizabeth you are too good you al ways think the best of everybody now i think the worst of most people and do not see much real value or common sense around me mr bingley for example he may not be intending to hurt you but misery can be caused by someone being just weak and indecisive i m convinced his sisters and his friend mr darcy are trying to influence him against you another ex ample is charlotte i can t understand how she could agree to marry such a self important proud silly man dear lizzy said jane we must respect charlotte s deci sion she may well be happy with mr collins and as for mr bingley we shouldn t expect a sociable young man to be so careful of his behaviour women often imagine admiration means more than it really does and men want that to happen i prefer to believe that i was mistaken in thinking he cared for me and that his sisters love him and approve of his wish to marry miss darcy i don t want to think badly of him or his sisters that would be worse than anything elizabeth had to accept jane s wishes and from then on mr bingley s name was seldom mentioned between them elizabeth visits mr and mrs collins the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man the netherfield ladies would have had dif ficulty in believing that a man who lived by buying and selling could be so well mannered and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was a pleasant intelligent elegant woman and a grest favourite with her longbourn nieces especially the two eldest who often stayed with her in london when mrs gardiner had given the presents she had brought with her and described the newest fashions she was obliged to listen to mrs bennet s complaints i ve suffered greatly since your last visit sister cried mrs bennet just imagine two of my daughters were very close to marriage and then nothing i do not blame jane who would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is hard to think she might have been mrs collins by now if she hadn t been so obstinate the result is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before me it makes me quite ill to have such a disobedient daughter and such selfish neighbours but your coming just now is a great comfort to me and i am very glad to hear what you tell us about long sleeves mrs gardiner made a suitably sympathetic reply to her sister in law and later that day found the opportunity to dis cuss the matter in more detail with elizabeth alone i am sorry for jane she said kindly but lizzy these things happen often a young man like mr bingley fre quently falls in love with a pretty girl and when chance sepa rates them he forgets her very quickly yes aunt said elizabeth but in this case it was not chance but the young man s interfering friends who separated jane and mr bingley i m sure he was violently in love with her poor jane she s so sensitive i m afraid she may not get over it for some time now if it had been you lizzy you would have recovered more quickly by finding humour in the situation but do you think i could persuade jane to come back with us to london perhaps a change of air would make her feel better elizabeth was extremely grateful to her aunt for this kind suggestion and felt sure jane would gladly agree i hope added mrs gardiner that she will not be influenced by the hope of seeing the young man we live in such a different part of town that it is very unlikely they will meet unless he actually comes to see her that is quite impossible because his friend mr darcy would not allow him to visit so unfashionable an address but despite her protest elizabeth secretly thought that jane might see bingley in london and that a meeting would probably reawaken his affection for her the gardiners stayed at longbourn for a week and mrsbennet made sure there was always some entertainment for her brother and sister in law whenever there was a dinner party at longbourn house some of the officers were always invited mrs gardiner who had noticed that mr wickham was a very frequent visitor and that elizabeth spoke admiringly of him took care to observe them both she saw enough to make her a little anxious and decided to speak to elizabeth about him when they were alone lizzy she began i can see that you and mr wickham like each other but i must warn you not to get seriously in volved with him i admit he s a most interesting young man but sadly he has no fortune you are a sensible girl and must realize that you would disappoint your father by agreeing to marry a penniless young man my dear aunt do not worry i ll take care of myself and mr wickham too he won t be in love with me if i can pre vent it elizabeth be serious i m sorry aunt i ll try again at present i m certainly not in love with him but he is by far the most agreeable man i ve ever met and if he really loved me but i would hate to dis appoint my father or make any of you unhappy i cannot promise what i will do but i will really try to do what i think is wisest i hope you are satisfied with that her aunt replied that she was and received elizabeth s thanks for her kind advice several days after this the gardiners returned to london taking jane with them the day of mr collins wedding soon arrived and mrs bennet had to watch charlotte lucas become mrs collins before the bride left longbourn for hunsford however she asked eliza beth to come and visit her in her new home as soon as possible elizabeth could not refuse although she did not imagine it would be an enjoyable visit it was arranged that elizabeth would accompany sir william lucas and maria one of his oth er daughters on their intended visit to hunsford in march a week after jane s departure elizabeth received a letter from her sister saying that she had seen miss bingley and hoped to continue their friendship elizabeth shook her head over this she was not surprised to hear from jane a few weeks later that caroline bingley had made no further attempts to communicate with her former dear friend elizabeth was sad dened to read of jane s disappointment but felt more cheerful when she told herself that jane would no longer be deceived by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over as a punishment for him she seriously hoped he would soon marry mr darcy s sister who according to wickham would make him quickly regret what he had thrown away at about this time elizabeth also received a letter from mrs gardiner asking about wickham and she was able to reply quite honestly that there was no danger of her marrying him he had transferred his affections to a miss king who had re cently inherited ten thousand pounds elizabeth saw exactly what was happening but her heart had only been slightly touched and she was able to convince herself that it was quite natural for such an agreeable young man to wish for fortune and independence january and february passed and the time for elizabeth s visit to mr and mrs collins approached she had improved the plan by arranging to spend a night in london at her uncle and aunt s house before continuing the journey into kent she was very much looking forward to seeing jane who was still stay ing with the gardiners the journey seemed long to elizabeth because sir william and maria had nothing to say worth hearing but when the coach arrived at the gardiners house at lunch time elizabeth was delighted to see that her sister looked as healthy and lovely as before in a private conversation with her aunt later howev er elizabeth discovered that jane had been suffering from peri ods of depression although she always tried bravely to appear cheerful the afternoon and evening passed only too quickly and the next day elizabeth and the other travellers set off again when the coach arrived in hunsford they were all quite excited to see on one side of the road lady catherine s great park which they had heard so much about at last on the other side they came to the rectory where they were warmly wel comed by mr collins and charlotte elizabeth was more and more pleased she had come when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that marriage had not changed her cousin s manners he in sisted on greeting them all with formal politeness and long speeches and showed them round the house explaining its many good points in exhausting detail elizabeth could not help thinking that perhaps he was speaking particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but although everything seemed neat and comfortable she was un able to please him with a sigh of regret in fact she wondered how charlotte could look so cheerful with such a companion but whenever mr collins said anything of which his wife might be ashamed which was quite often charlotte wisely did not appear to be listening and when mr collins showed them proudly round his garden in which he himself enjoyed working elizabeth admired the serious way in which charlotte praised gardening as a most healthy exercise and admitted en couraging her husband to work outdoors as much as possible elizabeth had to confess to herself that surprisingly char lotte really appeared to be happy when mr collins could be forgotten the house seemed very pleasant and comfortable and from charlotte s evident enjoyment of her home elizabeth supposed he must often be forgotten the visitors had only been in the house for a day when a message came form lady catherine inviting them all to dinner at rosings park the next day mr collins was delighted and congratulated his guests on their good luck i confess that i might have expected her ladyship to invite us all to drink tea at rosings on sunday he said but to invite the whole party to dinner so soon after your arrival too what a generous and considerate lady she is the whole of the rest of that day and the next morning were spent discussing their visit to rosings this made sir william and maria quite nervous when the moment came to walk across the park and enter the great lady s house elizabeth however was unimpressed by what she had heard of lady catherine and remained calm she was interested to see that lady catherine was a tall large woman who held herself stiffly and proudly and received her guests with an air of disdain she spoke loudly and decided ly on every matter and was clearly convinced of her superiority over other people her daughter anne was completely differ ent a small thin ill looking lady who spoke very little and only in a whisper the dinner was very good and was highly praised by mr collins his repeated compliments which elizabeth thought were embarrassing appeared to please lady catherine very much after dinner her ladyship talked continuously giving her opinions without any fear of contradiction or even comment she then asked elizabeth many detailed questions about her ed ucation her sisters and her father s income although eliza beth considered these questions extremely personal and almost rude she answered them politely and calmly at the end of the long evening the visitors were driven home in lady catherine s carriage while mr collins praised his patron for her elegance intelligence and hospitality this visit was repeated twice a week but there was little other entertainment in hunsford elizabeth had pleasant con versations with charlotte or read books or walked along a narrow path by lady catherine s park which no one else seemed to use it was a quiet life but she was satisfied with it however two weeks after her arrival in hunsford she heard that some visitors were coming to stay at rosings lady catherine s nephew mr darcy was expected soon accompa nied by his cousin colonel fitzwilliam the next day the two gentlemen arrived and came almost immediately to the rectory colonel fitzwilliam was about thirty not handsome but very gentlemanly and he talked pleasantly to the ladies but mr darcy looked as cold and proud as ever and after greeting mrs collins spoke only a few stiffly polite words to elizabeth she took the opportunity of asking him if he had by any chance seen jane in london recently and thought he looked a little confused when he answered that he had not had that pleasure soon after that the two gentlemen returned to rosings colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired by the ladies who felt that he would add considerably to the enjoyment of their evenings at rosings but it was not until easter day that they received an invitation from lady catherine and when they arrived in her sitting room it was clear that she was far more interested in her nephews than in her other guests colonel fitzwilliam however seemed really glad to see them and he came at once to sit beside elizabeth they talked so agreeably and amusingly together that mr darcy turned his eyes towards them and looked curiously at them several times when her ladyship also noticed she called loudly across the room fitzwilliam what are you talking about with miss ben net let me hear what it is we re speaking of music madam he said when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then please speak to all of us i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt to play i would have been a great musician but i often tell young ladies practice is very important i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and she is very welcome to come to rosings and practise on the piano in the servants hall she won t be in anyone s way there i can promise her mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s insensitive words meanwhile colonel fitzwilliam had persuaded elizabeth to play some music and she sat down at the piano but when she had started playing mr darcy went to stand in front of the piano where he had a good view of her face at the end of her first piece of music elizabeth said smiling you intend to frighten me mr darcy by coming to listen to me but i m obstinate and won t be frightened i don t think you really believe i intend to alarm you and i ve had the pleasure of knowing you long enouph to be aware that you occasionally enjoy stating opinions which are not your own elizabeth laughed at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will teach you not to believe a word i say indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous of you to mention all my faults and perhaps rather foolish too because i may take my revenge and tell things about you which your re lations will be shocked to hear i am not afraid of you said darcy smiling but let me hear your accusation cried colonel fitzwilliam i d like to hear how he behaves among strangers well prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time i ever saw him was at a ball in hertfordshire and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i m sorry to cause you pain but that is what hap pened he danced only four dances although gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down waiting for a partner mr darcy you must admit it i had not at that time the honour of knowing anybody at the ball apart from my own group of friends i should perhaps have asked to be introduced but i do not like to recommend myself to strangers i do not find it easy to talk to people i don t know you don t want to take the trouble to do it darcy that s why said colonel fitzwilliam i cannot play this piano as well as some other women said elizabeth but i ve always assumed it is my own faultbecause i don t take the trouble to practise i know that i am capable of playing as well as anyone darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have spent your time in a much better way no one who hears you could imagine any possible improvement we neither of us perform to strangers just then lady catherine interrupted them to comment on elizabeth s playing miss bennet would play quite well if she had a london teacher of course anne would have been a delightful performer if her health had allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see his reaction to anne de bourgh s name but neither at that moment nor at any other could she observe any sign of love or even interest in his cousin lady catherine continued to give miss bennet advice on her playing but at the request of the gentlemen elizabeth stayed at the piano for the rest of the evening darcy proposes marriage elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning writ ing to jane while mrs collins and maria were shopping in the village she heard the doorbell ring and knew that meant a visitor had arrived but she was greatly surprised when mr darcy and mr darcy only was shown into the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone i apologize for disturbing you miss bennet i understood that all the ladies were at home please don t apologize mr darcy i hope lady catherine and her daughter are well very well thank you he said no more as he seemed in danger of sinking into total silence elizabeth had to think of something to say she remarked how very suddenly you all left netherfield last november mr darcy i hope mr bingley and his sisters were well when you left london perfectly thank you that was all the answer he gave i think i have heard that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again it is probable that he will spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends elsewhere elizabeth did not want to talk any longer about mr bingley and determined to leave the conversation to mr darcy she remained silent he understood and soon began to speak again mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed she is one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him although i m not sure i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and financially speaking it s a good marriage it must be very agreeable to her to be such a short distance from her own family and friends a short distance you say it is nearly eighty kilometres and what is that little more than half a day s journey on a good road yes i call it a very short distance i would never have said mrs collins lived near her family cried elizabeth that shows how much you are attached to hertfordshire anywhere outside the longbourn area would i suppose seem far away to you as he spoke he smiled a little perhaps he supposed she was thing of jane and nether field thought elizabeth and she blushed whether the dis tance seems long or short depends on many circumstances if the family s income is large enough to pay for frequent jour neys then distance is not a problem but mr and mrs collins will not be able to afford to travel very often despite their comfortable income i m certain my friend does not consider hunsford near her family mr darcy moved his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such a very strong local attach ment you haven t spent your whole life at longbourn i am sure elizabeth looked surprised experiencing a change of feeling the gentleman moved his chair away again took a newspaper from the table and glancing at it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent they discussed kent calmly and po litely for a few minutes and were then interrupted by char lotte and maria who had returned from the village mr darcy sat a little while longer without saying much to anybody and then went away what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he had gone my dear lizzy he must be in love with you or he would never have visited us in this familiar way but when elizabeth described his silence that did not seem likely even to hopeful charlotte and they could only suppose that he had nothing better to do in fact from now on both mr darcy and colonel fitzwilliam called regularly at the rectory it was obvious that colonel fitzwilliam came because he en joyed talking to the ladies and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite wickham but it was more difficult to understand why mr darcy came he did not often speak and seldom appeared interested in the conversa tion even charlotte who observed mr darcy closely was not sure whether he admired elizabeth or not and began to hope that perhaps her friend might marry colonel fitzwilliam in stead when she took her daily walk along the path bordering the park elizabeth met mr darcy unexpectedly more than once this was the more surprising because she was careful to in form him that it was her favourite walk so that he could avoid meeting her it was also strange that although he could just have greeted her and walked on he always thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her she could not quite understand him but one day as she was walking she met colonel fitzwilliam not mr darcy and greeted him with a smile they walked back to the rectory together are you leaving kent this sunday she asked yes if darcy doesn t put it off again he is fortunate to be able to arrange things as he likes well we all want to do that replied colonel fitzwilliam but he is used to doing what he likes because he is rich and many others are poor i for example i m a younger son you know and won t inherit my father s fortune so i shall never be rich or independent like darcy now seriously you cannot call yourself poor when have you ever suffered because of lack of money well perhaps i haven t really suffered much yet but there are difficulties a younger son doesn t have a free choice when marrying he cannot afford to marry a girl with no fortune elizabeth blushed thinking that he might mean her and be gan to talk of something else she asked him about darcy s sis ter and mentioned that the bingley sisters liked her very much bingley yes i know them their brother is very pleasant a great friend of darcy s answered colonel fitzwilliam oh yes mr darcy is extremely kind to mr bingley and takes very good care of him said elizabeth drily yes i believe darcy does take care of bingley i m think ing of a recent situation which darcy was telling me about on the journey here he was congratulating himself on having saved a friend from a most foolish marriage of course i m not sure the friend was bingley as darcy didn t mention the name did mr darcy give you his reasons for interfering i understood that there were some very strong objections to the lady elizabeth could not speak for a moment when she was able to control her anger she changed the conversation as soon as they reached the rectory she said goodbye to colonel fitzwilliam and went straight upstairs to her room at last she could think without interruption about what he had told her bingley nust have been the friend to whom darcy was refer ring she had always assumed that darcy was involved in the plan to separate jane and bingley but it now appeared that he not miss bingley was the main cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer the very strong objec tions to the lady probably consisted of having one uncle who was a country lawyer and another who was in business in lon don there could be no possible objections to jane herself as she was intelligent beautiful and charming nor could anyone object to mr bennet as a father in law when elizabeth thought of her mother she felt a little less confident she was still convinced however that mr darcy was interested in high born connections rather than character or common sense it was this the worst kind of pride which had destroyed for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate gener ons heart in the world thinking about all this made elizabeth so upset and unhap py that she soon had a headache it grew so much worse in the evening and she was so unwilling to see mr darcy that she decided not to go to rosings that evening with mr and mrs collins instead she stayed in the rectory sitting room reread ing jane s recent letters from london she was saddened to discover that although jane never complained or referred to the past in almost every line there was a lack of cheerfulness which elizabeth had not noticed the first time and which now made her rather anxious she was relieved to think that darcy would be leaving rosings in two days time and she herself would be with jane in less than two weeks colonel fitzwilliam would also be leaving with darcy but he had made it clear that he had no intention of proposing to her so she did not intend to be unhappy about him just then she heard the doorbell and wondered if it might be colonel fitzwilliam come to enquire about her health but to her astonishment she saw mr darcy walk into the room in a hrried manner he began to ask how she was feeling she answered him with cold politeness he sat down for a few mo ments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said nothing after a silence of several min utes he came towards her with none of his usual calmness and said in vain have i struggled it is no good i cannot conquer my feelings you must allow me to tell you how warmly i admire and love you elizabeth stared blushed doubted and was silent he con sidered this sufficient encouragement and confessed all that he felt and had felt for a long time for her he expressed himself well but it was not only of love that he spoke he also talked of his pride and his sense of her social inferiority which had made him struggle against his feelings for so long in spite of her dislike for him elizabeth appreciated what a compliment such a man s affection was and was at first sorry for the pain he was about to receive but soon as she heard his references to her inferior position she lost all pity and became very angry she waited patiently however until he had finished he ended by describing the strength of his love for her whicn in spite of all his attempts he had been unable to con quer with arguments of reason and common sense and finally he asked for her hand in marriage she could see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer which only made her angrier i believe society considers it correct in cases like this she replied to express grateful thanks so if i could feel grateful i would now thank you but i cannot i have never wanted your good opinion of me and i cannot accept it i m sorry to hurt anyone but it has not been done deliberately and i hope the pain will not last long the pride which you tell me has long prevented the expression of your affection can have little difficulty in conquering your feelings after this explanation mr darcy whose eyes were fixed on her face was both an gry and surprised by her words his face went pale and he was clearly struggling to control himself there was a dreadful pause and then he spoke in a voice of forced calmness and this is all the reply i am to have the honour of expect ing i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little attempt at politeness i am rejected i might as well ask why with so evident a wish to offend and insult me you chose to tell me that you loved me against your reason and even against your character but even if my own feelings towards you had been favourable do you think anything could tempt me to accept the man who has destroyed perhaps for ever the happiness of a most dear sister as she said this mr darcy changed colour but he listened without trying to interrupt her as she continued i have every reason in the world to think badly of you can you deny that you were the cause of jane s separation from mr bingley and of her unhappiness can you deny it i have no wish to deny that i did everything i could to separate them and that i am delighted with my success towards my friend i have been kinder than to myself elizabeth treated this last remark with disdain but its meaning did not escape her but it is not only because of jane that i dislike you my opinion of you was decided long ago i heard all about your character from mr wickham now what can you have to say on this matter how can you defend yourself you take an eager interest in that gentleman said darcy less calmly than before the colour was rising in his face who can help feeling an interest in him when we hear of the unfortunate life he has had unfortunate repeated darcy contemptuously yes unfortunate indeed and it was your fault cried elizabeth with energy you took away his chance of a comfortable income and a good position which you knew had been intended for him you have left him poor and dependent and disappointed you have done all this and you can still treat the mention of his name with contempt and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me thank you for explaining it so fully but perhaps you might not have considered these offences of mine if your pride had not been hurt by my honest confession of my reasons for not proposing to you earlier perhaps i should have hidden my struggles and flat tered you by pretending i had every reason to love you but i hate disguise of any sort nor am i ashamed of my feelings of pride which are very natural could you expect me to delight in the inferiority of your family compared to mine elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment mr darcy you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it the moment i first met you i noticed your pride your sense of superiority and your selfish disdain for the feelings of others later events strengthened my dislike for you you are the last man in the world whom i could ever be persuaded to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly understand your feelings forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness with these words he hurried out of the room and the house elizabeth felt so weak that she sat down and cried for half an hour she was so astonished to have received a proposal from mr darcy his affection for her must indeed have been strong to conquer all the objections he had to her family and position objections which had made him prevent his friend marrying her sister but his terrible pride his shameless confes sion of what he had done to separate jane and bingley and his cruelty towards wickham soon removed any pity she might have felt for him elizabeth learns more about darcy and wickham the next morning elizabeth had still not recovered from the surprise of darcy s proposal to her feeling in need of exercise and fresh air she decided to have a walk in order to avoid meeting mr darcy she kept away from her favourite path but could not resist walking a little way into lady catherine s park there she was astonished to see darcy him self approaching her and calling her name i have been walking some time in the hope of meeting you he said will you do me the honour of reading this let ter and handing her an envelope he bowed slightly and walked quickly away with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and began to read it as she continued her walk alone do not be alarmed madam that i shall repeat the offer which so disgusted you last night i have no intention of mentioning again wishes which for the happiness of both of us cannot be too soon forgotten i would not have written but justice re quires my character to be defended you accused me last night of two very different offences the first was that i had separated mr bingley from your sister in spite of their mutual affection and the second was that i had destroyed mr wickham s chance of future wealth and happiness in spite of my father s honourable promises to him i hope that you will no longer blame me for either of these offences when you have read the explanation which follows if i am forced to describe feelings which offend you i can only say i am sorry i had not been long in hertfordshire before i noticed that bingley preferred your elder sister jane to any other young woman but i had often seen him in love before and it wasn t until the netherfield ball that i realized how serious his at tachment was i was careful to observe your sister closely and as her manners and appearance were as pleasant and cheerful as ever i remained convinced that she did not feel strongly about him i was perhaps deceived by her calmness and in that case your anger has not been unreasonable but i sincerely believed that her heart had not been touched i ob jected to bingley s possible marriage to her not only for those reasons of social inferiority that i mentioned to you last night but also for reasons which in my case i had tried to for get but which i must state now the behaviour that evening of your mother your three younger sisters and occasionally even your father was so lacking in social correctness that i made up my mind to save my friend from what i considered would be a most unhappy marriage if you are upset by my description of your family s faults it may comfort you to con sider that you and your elder sister have avoided any share of blame and deserve nothing but honourable praise for your behaviour to continue when i was in london with the help of bingley s sisters who shared my opinion i explained to him the disadvantages of marriage to your sister this alone would not have been enough to prevent the marriage if i had not also been able to convince him of your sister s indiffer ence to him then it was easy to persuade him not to return to hertfordshire i do regret one thing however miss bingley and i both knew that your sister was in london but we hid the fact from bingley in this i consider i was less than honest but i have no other apology to offer your other more serious accusation refers to mr wickham here again i may cause you pain only you can tell how much in order to show you his real character i must explain the whole of his connection with my family his late father worked for mine for many years helping to look after the pemberley farms his son george wickham received much kindness from my father who paid for him to go to school and to university my father hoped the young man would enter the church if he became a priest i was to give him the post of rector in a village near pemberley when it became vacant but even before my father died i had discovered wickham s weakness of character and lack of morals after my father s death wickham wrote to inform me that he did not intend to enter the church and asked for an amount of money instead of the post of rector i knew that with his character faults he ought not to become a priest and i therefore agreed at once the business was soon arranged he resigned all claim to the church post and accepted three thousand pounds instead i hoped that i would not see him or hear form him again but three years later he wrote again this time to ask for the rec tor s post informing me that his money had all gone and his situation was desperate you will hardly blame me for refus ing since then he has doubtless been violent in accusing me of injustice to all who will listen to him there is one more circumstance which i would like to for get myself but which i must now mention i rely on your keep ing this confidential a year ago i sent my sister who is ten years younger than i am on holiday to ramsgate in kent in the care of a female companion unfortunately there was an understanding between this woman and mr wickham who also went to ramsgate with her help and encouragement he spent a great deal of time with georgiana and flattered her so much that she believed she was in love and agreed to elope with him she was only fifteen at the time and i am glad to say that she confessed everything to me immediately when i arrived unexpectedly in ramsgate just before their planned elopement naturally i dismissed the companion and wrote to wickham who left the place at once he was doubt less most interested in my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that he was also eager to revenge himself on me i hope you will now clear me of all blame in this matter if madam you doubt the truthfulness of my description of these circumstances i suggest you speak to colonel fitzwilliam as my cousin and close friend he knows every detail of these events and will be happy to support what i say i will only add may god be with you fitzwilliam darcy elizabeth experienced a variety of emotions as she read the let ter she was astonished to discover that darcy was capable of any sort of apology it was with a strong prejudice against any thing he might say that she began reading his explanation of what had happened at netherfield and at first she was too an gry with him to treat him with justice but when she went on to read his description of his relationship with wickham she hesitated it was so very different from wickham s story which she would have preferred to believe but after a few mo ments thought she realized that darcy s statement was much more likely to be true she began to remember several things about wickham which now appeared strange to her on the first evening she had met him he had told the whole story about his lost fortune and the darcy family to her a total stranger then he had boasted of having no fear of darcy but had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week in addi tion he had waited until the bingleys and darcy had left netherfield before making his accusations public she reminded herself that no one in hertfordshire knew anything about wickham s past so it was quite possible that he lacked morals as darcy said she had to admit that darcy himself though horribly proud had always shown himself to be a gen tleman finally darcy would certainly not have dared to refer her to colonel fitzwilliam if he were not certain that his cousin could prove these statements she became absolutely ashamed of herself how badly i have behaved she cried how prejudiced i have been i who have always been so proud of my ability to judge people that pride has led me blindly into making a stupid mistake flattered by wickham s interest and offended by darcy s coolness i have misjudged both of them till this moment i never knew myself she re read what darcy had to say about jane and this time was forced to admit that jane had displayed few outward signs of her feelings for bingley charlotte had even commented on it then when elizabeth looked again at darcy s comments on her family s behaviour her sense of shame was very great and she could not deny the justice of his words feeling more mis erable than she had ever felt before she slowly returned to the rectory where she had difficulty in maintaining a cheerful ap pearance mr darcy and colonel fitzwilliam left rosings the next day and were sadly missed by their aunt who now had so little entertainment that she invited the collinses and their visitors several times that week as elizabeth only had a few days left before the end of her visit she thought it fortunate that most of her time was occupied when she had a moment to herself it was a great relief to walk outside in the garden or the park alone with her thoughts she soon knew mr darcy s letter by heart although she was still angry with him for the proud over confident way in which he had proposed her anger turned against herself when she considered how unjustly she had criti cized and accused him she respected his character and felt pity for his disappointment but did not for a moment regret her re fusal or have the slightest desire to see him ever again she was saddened when she thought of her family her fa ther enjoyed laughing at kitty s and lydia s foolishness so much that he never attempted to control his two youngest daughters and her mother whose own behaviour was far from correct was completely unaware that anything was wrong and poor jane it now appeared that bingley s affection had been sincere and jane s disappointment had been indirectly caused by the behaviour of her own near relations on saturday morning elizabeth said goodbye to her friend charlotte feeling sorry to leave her with such a husband but charlotte although regretting the departure of her visitors appeared quite content with her domestic arrangements mr collins took care to say to elizabeth before she left i do hope my dear miss elizabeth that you will be as happy in marriage as i am my dear charlotte and i have one mind and one way of thinking we seem to be made for each other it is most fortunate when that is the case was all that elizabeth could safely reply by midday she had arrived in london where she had ar ranged to stay a few days at her aunt s house there was how ever no opportunity to discuss mr darcy s letter with jane until they both reached longbourn again at the end of the week it was pleasant to be at home again but elizabeth was very conscious of her younger sisters silliness they were full of the sad news they had just heard that the regiment was leaving meryton in two weeks time and would be staying for the summer in brighton a holiday town on the south coast lydia and her mother were trying hard to persuade mr bennet to take them to brighton too for several months as the summer would be so miserable in hertfordshire without the officers fortunately elizabeth felt sure her father would not agree to this foolish idea when she and jane were alone she told her sister about darcy s proposal of marriage jane was astonished but soon her sisterly feelings made her think it quite natural and her kind heart felt pity for darcy s disappointment however when she heard about george wickham s wickedness as ex plained in darcy s letter she was deeply shocked after some discussion the sisters decided not to tell anyone what they knew about wickham as he would soon be leaving meryton in any case elizabeth felt greatly relieved by this conversation she had got rid of two of her secrets and was certain of a willing listen er in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but she dared not tell the third and explain to jane how sincere bingley s feelings for her had been she could see that jane was not happy because of her continued warm affection for bingley however there seemed little chance of bingley marry ing her now and elizabeth did not want to deepen jane s feel ings of regret for her lost happiness elizabeth in derbyshire during the week before the regiment s departure all the young ladies in the meryton area became extremely de pressed only the two elder miss bennets were still able to eat drink sleep and lead a normal life they were often scolded by kitty and lydia who could not understand such hard heartedness how shall we manage without the officers they cried miserably how can you smile like that lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their sadness i re member when colonel millar s regiment went away twenty five years ago she said i thought my heart was broken i m sure mine will be broken said lydia if we could only go to brighton said mrs bennet i m certain a little sea bathing would be good for me oh yes but papa is so disagreeable about it elizabeth tried not to listen but could not help seeing the justice of darcy s objections to her family but soon lydia s bitterness changed to absolute delight when she received an invitation from colonel forster s wife to accompany her to brighton with the regiment mrs forster was a very young woman only recently married and as cheerful and sociable as lydia witn whom she had been friendly for two months poor kitty was very upset at not being included in the invitation but lydia cared nothing for her sister s feelings she ran wildly through the house calling for everyone s congratulations and laughing and talking more loudly than ever elizabeth could not share her sister s happiness and felt it was her duty to advise her father secretly to refuse permission for lydia to go but she could not convince him that lydia would be in any real danger and so all the arrangements were made for her sister s departure elizabeth thought her father was wrong however and was still worried about how lydia would behave in an atmosphere of greater freedom and among the temptations of a fashionable seaside town like brighton elizabeth had seen mr wickham regularly since her return from kent at family parties and visits she no longer thought him so agreeable as the rich miss king had left meryton to stay with her uncle mr wickham appeared eager to transfer his affections back to elizabeth his confidence in his own charm and ability to please annoyed elizabeth very much so that when she met him for the last time before the regiment s departure she spoke quite coldly to him in reply to a polite question of his about her hunsford visit she could not stop herself mentioning her frequent meetings with mr darcy and her favourable opinion of that gentleman s character wickham looked a little embarrassed and made no further attempt to charm elizabeth they separated at last with mutual politeness and possibly a mutual desire never to meet again when lydia left for brighton elizabeth had to put up with mrs bennet s and kitty s constant complaints that longbourn had become very dull fortunately she was able to look for ward to a trip which she would soon be taking with mr and mrs gardiner they had planned to visit the lake district but mrs gardiner had recently written to say that as her husband s business made it necessary to shorten their holiday to three weeks they would not have time to visit the whole of the lake district comfortably instead she suggested visiting derbyshire an area with a particularly strong attraction for her as she had spent a large part of her early life there eliza beth was disappointed but accepted the new plan at once al though it was impossible to hear of derbyshire without think ing of pemberley and its owner she felt sure she could avoid meeting mr darcy there four weeks later mr and mrs gardiner arrived at long bourn where they had arranged to leave their children in jane s care the next day they set out with elizabeth on their journey the three of them made excellent travelling compan ions sharing an intelligent interest in the people and places they saw on their way and a strong affection for each other after visiting oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth and birmingham they arrived in derbyshire and decided to stay in the small town of lambton where mrs gardiner had lived be fore her marriage elizabeth discovered that mr darcy s house pemberley was only eight kilometres away from lambton i often used to go to pemberley when i was younger said mrs gardiner wouldn t you like to see it lizzy we could go tomorrow it s a beautiful place wickham spent his youth there you know i i am rather tired of large country houses aunt said elizabeth forced to pretend how dreadful it would be to meet mr darcy while viewing his house but when she asked a servant at the hotel one or two careful questions that evening she was told that mr darcy was not at home at the moment greatly relieved she felt able to agree to her aunt s sugges tion when it was repeated the next morning and mr gardiner ordered a carriage immediately in a short time they entered the gates of pemberley park and drove through an extensive and beautiful wood at the top of a hill they had their first view of pemberley house situated on the other side of a valley with a line of high wooded hills behind the house was a large handsome stone building which appeared to fit naturally into the scenery mr and mrs gardiner were warm in their admiration and elizabeth was de lighted at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pember ley might be worthwhile they drove up to the front door and asked to be allowed to visit the house the pemberley housekeeper a respectable el derly woman showed them round all the rooms were of a good size and elegantly yet sensibly furnished from every window there was an attractive view elizabeth began to admire the owner s taste in everything she saw and i might have been mistress of this place she thought instead of viewing these rooms as a stranger i might be welcoming my uncle and aunt as visitors but no she sud denly remembered that could never be i wouldn t have been able to invite my uncle and aunt or any other of my vulgar family connections this was a lucky thought which saved her from something like regret she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her mas ter were really absent but luckily her uncle asked the question instead it was quite alarming to hear that mr darcy was ex pected to arrive the next day with a large group of friends how glad elizabeth was that their own journey had not been delayed a day mr and mrs gardiner were enjoying their conversation with the housekeeper who seemed content to talk about her master mr darcy is a very handsome gentleman as you will see from the painting upstairs his sister is most attractive too and so accomplished she plays and sings the whole day my master has just sent a new piano from london for her he s such a kind brother he ll do anything for miss georgiana does mr darcy spend much time at pemberley asked mr gardiner not as much as i d like sir if your master married he might spend more time here yes sir but i don t know when that ll be i don t know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled and elizabeth listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper continued it s no more than the truth every body who knows him says the same he s never spoken a cross word to me and i ve known him since he was a baby some people call him proud but i ve never seen any of that he s the best master that ever lived elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy she wondered this was the most extraordinary praise for the man she had always thought so disagreeable and proud especially with people he considered inferior to himself she longed to hear more but now the housekeeper was leading them upstairs soon elizabeth found herself in front of the painting of mr darcy he was smiling at her just as she remembered him smiling sometimes when he looked at her she looked at the picture silently for several minutes before going downstairs with the others at that moment elizabeth certainly felt more warmly towards mr darcy than at any time since their first meeting she was beginning to realize that she had underestimated his character his housekeeper s opinion of him was totally favourable and what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as she stood in front of his picture she gratefully remembered the warmth of his feelings for her and began to forget the way in which he had expressed them as they had now seen all the rooms which were open to the public the housekeeper called the gardener who was going to show them the park and gardens they were just walking away from the house when elizabeth turned to have one last look and saw the owner of pemberley come suddenly forward from behind the house they were within twenty metres of each other and eliza beth could not avoid his seeing her their eyes instantly met and they both blushed he appeared very surprised but recov ering quickly approached and spoke to elizabeth if not calmly at least with perfect politeness astonished and con fused she received his greetings with embarrassment soon he could find no more to say and left her to return to the house mr and mrs gardiner who had been watching from a distance expressed their admiration of his appearance but eliz abeth could only think of her feelings how unfortunate that she had come she blushed again it might seem as if she had planned this meeting with him and his behaviour was so different never before had she heard him speak so politely and so gently what could it mean her head full of these thoughts she joined her uncle and aunt in their walk through the gardens they were walking slowly beside an attractive stream when they noticed mr dar cy coming towards them this time elizabeth was able to con trol herself better and she returned his greetings politely she hid a smile when he asked her to do him the honour of intro ducing him to her friends as she felt sure he was not expecting the well mannered gardiners to be some of her low born rela tions he certainly seemed surprised when she introduced her uncle and aunt but took care to talk for some time to mr gar diner with every appearance of interest elizabeth was delight ed that these relations at least could not be criticized for their poor behaviour or lack of intelligence on their way back to the house mr darcy walked beside elizabeth there was a short si lence before she spoke your housekeeper informed us you would not arrive until tomorrow so i had not expected to find you here it is true i came early on business the rest of the party will be here tomorrow among them are mr bingley and his sisters whom you know he continued after a pause and there is one other person who particularly wishes to meet you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to you surprised but flattered by this great compliment elizabeth gave her permission when they arrived at the house mr darcy offered them some refreshment but they politely refused mr darcy helped the ladies into the carriage and as it drove away from pemberley elizabeth watched him walking slowly back towards the house mr and mrs gardiner were loud in their praise of him but elizabeth said very little the very next morning mr darcy brought his sister to visit elizabeth and the gardiners at the hotel in lambton mr and mrs gardiner were astonished by the honour they were receiving but elizabeth s obvious embarrassment and darcy s haste in making the visit so immediately soon provided them with an explanation they observed their niece and darcy care fully during the visit and could not doubt that the gentleman was in love although they were not certain of the lady s feel ings elizabeth was delighted to discover that georgiana darcy far from being proud as wickham had said was just very shy with quiet gentle manners it was clear that she greatly ad mired her brother and had every intention of liking miss ben net as darcy had spoken of her so favourably elizabeth was al so satisfied to see that bingley who was with the darcys did not seem particularly interested in georgiana in spite of caro line bingley s wishes and she had to admit that she had never seen mr darcy behaving so sociably and pleasantly not only to herself but also to the relations to whom he had referred with such disdain during that last conversation in hunsford rectory elizabeth herself was more than usually anxious to make herself agreeable to everybody and she succeeded be cause bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy de termined to be pleased miss darcy encouraged by her brother invited elizabeth and the gardiners to dinner at pemberley in two days time and when this invitation had been accepted the darcys and mr bingley left with many warm expressions of politeness on both sides mr and mrs gardiner were very curious about their niece s feelings for mr darcy but were careful not to question her that evening elizabeth lay awake for two whole hours try ing to understand how she felt about him she now thought of him with respect and a certain admiration and was deeply grateful to him not only for having once loved her but for still loving her enough to forgive her bitter rejection of him as well as all her unjust accusations the change she had noticed in a man who was once so proud must be caused by his love for her now since she was almost sure that if she wanted she could encourage him to propose to her again she only had to decide how far she wished to be involved in his future happi ness in which she already felt a real interest lydia and wickham on the third morning of her visit to lambton elizabeth received two letters from jane the first had been bad ly addressed and sent elsewhere then redirected her aunt and uncle were out walking so she sat down to read them at once the first had been written five days before and started just as expected with a description of longbourn dinner parties and visits but the second half of this letter was dated a day later and was evidently written in a great hurry this is what it said since writing the above dear lizzy something most unex pected and serious has happened but do not wish to alarm you we are all well it concerns poor lydia an express letter came at midnight last night when we were all in bed from colonel forster to inform us that she had run away to scot land with one of his officers with wickham in fact there of course she can marry without her parents approval imagine our surprise what a foolish marriage for both of them but at least he is not interested in her money as he must know my father can give her almost nothing kitty admits that she knew about lydia s attachment to wickham from lydia s letters our poor mother is very upset i must finish now as i cannot stay away from her for long i hope you can read this i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time to think elizabeth opened the second letter dated a day later and read impatiently my dearest sister i am so confused i cannot write properly i have bad news for you foolish though a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia might be we are now only too anxious to hear that it has taken place there is reason to fear they have not gone to scotland colonel forster arrived here yesterday he tells us that one of the officers a close friend of wickham believes that wickham never intended to go to scotland or to marry lydia at all the colonel followed the couple as far as london but they have not been seen leaving the capital our anxiety my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst and the colonel fears wickham is not a man to be trusted but i cannot believe him to be so wicked and is lydia so completely lacking in morals that she could live with a man without being married impossible now my poor mother is really ill my father is angry for perhaps the first time in his life and kitty is being scolded for keeping the attachment a secret while i am glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared some of the confusion and worry we have been experiencing i cannot help begging you all to come home as soon as possible my father is going to london with the colonel to try to find lydia i think he is too upset to achieve results in the best and safest way and my uncle s advice and help would be everything in the world i rely on his goodness oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth running to the door but just as she reached it mr darcy came in her pale face and strange manner prevented him from speaking and she who could think of nothing except lydia said hurriedly excuse me but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner immediately there is not a moment to lose good god what is the matter he cried then added let me or let the servant go to find mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated but her legs were trembling and she re alized he was right after giving the servant her message she sat down looking so ill that darcy could not leave her or stop himself saying gently let me call someone to look after you shall i get you a glass of wine you are very ill no thank you she replied i am quite well i am only upset by some dreadful news i ve just received form long bourn she burst into tears and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy watched her miserably in sympa thetic silence at last she spoke again it cannot be hidden from anyone my youngest sister has eloped with with mr wickham you know him too well to doubt what will happen she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to marry her she is lost for ever and i could have prevented it i knew how bad his character was if only i had told my family what i knew about him but it is all too late now darcy looked at her in astonishment i am shocked he said and sad very sad what has been done to find her and bring her back my father has gone to london and i hope my uncle will go too we shall leave lambton i hope in half an hour but i know very well that nothing can be done how can such a man be persuaded how can we even find them i have not the smallest hope it is horrible darcy made no answer he was walking up and down with a serious thoughtful expression on his face elizabeth soon ob served and instantly understood it she was losing her influence over him this proof of moral weakness in her family was driv ing him away from her never before had she so honestly be lieved she could have loved him as now when mutual affection must be impossible but she could not think for long of herself when lydia s situation was so desperate mr darcy left almost immediately politely regretting that elizabeth and her aunt and uncle would not in the circumstances be able to come to dinner at pember ley that day and again expressing his sympathy when mr and mrs gardiner entered the room elizabeth hurriedly explained everything to them and was greatly relieved when they agreed to leave at once to return to longbourn their packing was done at great speed and soon they were in the carriage driving south lizzy began mrs gardiner i cannot believe that wick ham s character is so bad that he would run away with lydia and not marry her do you really think he is capable of that my dear aunt jane and i both know that he has neither honesty nor honour he has falsely accused mr darcy and has lied wickedly about the whole darcy family you saw what a shy gentle girl miss darcy is but he had described her as proud disagreeable and disdainful but does lydia know nothing of this oh no that is the worst of all i didn t know the truth myself until my visit to kent and when i returned and told jane she and i decided not to make our knowledge public now i know that was a mistake i never thought that lydia could be in any danger from him when they arrived at longbourn elizabeth and her aunt were able to help jane in looking after the children they also attempted to calm mrs bennet who however refused to be calmed and blamed everyone except herself for the disaster if only i had been allowed to take the family to brighton this would not have happened poor dear lydia had no one to take care of her why did those forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure they neglected her of course i did not want her to go to brighton but nobody took any notice of me as usual and now mr bennet has gone to london and i m sure he ll fight wickham and then he ll be killed and then the collinses will turn us out of the house before he s cold in his grave do not worry sister said mr gardiner kindly i m going to london tomorrow to help my brother in law oh thank you my dear brother replied mrs bennet make sure you find lydia and wickham and if they are not married yet make them marry and tell lydia they mustn t wait for wedding clothes but she shall have as much money as she wants to buy them after they are married and keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in so ill that i can get no rest by night or by day and tell lydia not to buy any clothes until she s seen me because she doesn t know the best shops oh brother how kind you are i hope you will manage everything the next day mr gardiner travelled to london as he had promised now began a painful period of waiting for those left at longbourn they became even more anxious as news came from meryton of wickham s lies debts and secret attachments to most of the servant girls in the town everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and protested that they had always distrusted his great charm and appearance of goodness although elizabeth did not believe half of these stories she believed enough to feel sure that her sister s reputation was already lost and even jane almost despaired of receiving good news in a few day s time they were relieved to receive a letter from mr gardiner but unfortunately it only informed them that wickham and lydia had not yet been found apparently wickham had left gambling debts of over a thousand pounds behind him in brighton mr bennet was returning home the following day leaving his brother in law in london to continue the search when she heard this mrs bennet did not show as much satisfaction as her children expected considering the anxiety she had previously expressed for her husband s safety what is he coming home without poor lydia she cried and who will fight wickham and make him marry her mrs gardiner took the opportunity of mr bennet s return to go back to london herself with her children she was still longing to know how flizabeth s relationship with darcy had developed but elizabeth had not once mentioned his name so her aunt did not dare to ask any direct questions when mr bennet arrived home he appeared as calm as ever but in a conversation with elizabeth he admitted that he felt to blame for lydia s elopement i know i should have had more control over her he said and lizzy you were right i should never have let her go to brighton kitty who was listening said papa if i ever went to brighton i d behave much better than lydia has done you go to brighton cried her father i would not trust you within twenty kilometres of the place for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer may ever enter the house again or even pass through the village and balls will be absolutely forbidden unless you dance only with your sisters kitty taking these threats seriously began to cry well well said he don t make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i ll take you to the theatre at the end of that time two days later the news for which they had all been waiting so anxiously arrived mr gardiner s letter informed them that wickham and lydia had been found but that they were not married however certain financial arrangements had been made with wickham mr bennet was asked to pay lydia one hundred pounds a year as well as arranging for her to inherit her equal share of the five thousand pounds which the bennet girls would inherit after their parents death if these reasonable conditions were agreed wickham had promised to marry lydia at first elizabeth and jane were delighted that their sister s reputation would be saved through marriage even to such a man as wickham but then their father explained that wickham would never have agreed to marry lydia unless he had been paid a considerable amount of money immediately they began to worry that it would be difficult to repay mr gardiner who must have bribed wickham in this way mrs bennet however had no such worries he is her own uncle after all she cried happily why shouldn t he pay my dear dear lydia married at sixteen how i long to see her and dear wickham too but the wedding clothes i ll write to my sister in law about them at once i m so happy in a short time i ll have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds now that lydia was going to be married elizabeth greatly regretted telling darcy of her fears for her sister but even if lydia had been married in the most honourable way it was extremely unlikely that mr darcy would wish to connect himself with a family in which there was a close relationship with wickham the man he most justly disliked she could not expect him to go on caring for her as she felt certain he had done when they met in derbyshire but now that she was sure he could not love her she was convinced they could have been happy together he seemed to be exactly the man who would have suited her they could have usefully influenced each other his mind might have been softened and his manners improved by her sociability and she might have learnt from his greater judgement and knowledge of the world but no such relationship could now teach an admiring world what happiness in marriage was really like instead wickham would marry lydia with little chance of happiness for either of them mr and mrs gardiner had arranged for lydia to be married quietly in london from their house at first mr bennet had refused to allow his youngest daughter ever to enter his house again but eventually jane and elizabeth persuaded him to receive lydia and her husband after the wedding it would only be a short visit as almost immediately she and wickham would be moving north to newcastle where he had accepted a new army post when the carriage containing the young couple arrived at longbourn house the two elder bennet sisters were shocked to see how unashamed lydia was she entered the house laughing and joking and asked all her sisters to congratulate her wickham was no more embarrassed than she was and spoke to everyone in his usual flattering agreeable manner they seemed to have no idea of the anxiety they had caused by their shameless and wicked behaviour elizabeth was quite disgusted by their relaxed confident appearance and determined not to show any interest when lydia insisted on describing every detail of her wedding day she could not help reacting with astonishment however when lydia let slip the name of mr darcy he had apparently been present at the ceremony why would mr darcy elizabeth wondered attend the wedding of two people he must hold in the greatest contempt she could not discover the reason from lydia who suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a secret and she could not rest without knowing the truth so she hurriedly sent a note to her aunt in london asking urgently for an explanation bingley returns to netherfield elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving a reply from her aunt in the shortest time possible she sat down eagerly to read it my dear niece i must confess i am astonished by your request for information about mr darcy s share in arranging lydia s marriage i assumed that you would know all about it your uncle is as surprised as i am but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must tell you all the details on the day i returned to london from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy came to tell us he had discovered where your sister and wickham were staying the reason he gave for wanting to help was his belief that he was to blame for not making wickham s worthlessness more public and that therefore it was his duty to assist us in every possible way if he had another motive i am sure it would be just as honourable he knew that wickham had a close friend in london a woman who had once been companion to miss darcy and had been dismissed for some reason so mr darcy found this woman and bribed her to give him wickham s present address he went to see wickham and insisted on seeing lydia hoping to persuade her to return to her family however lydia told him she only cared for wickham and had no intention of leaving him whether he married her or not wickham privately told mr darcy that he had left the regiment because of his gambling debts not because he intended to marry lydia and that he was still hoping to find and marry a woman of fortune in order to have a comfortable income it was clearly necessary to persuade him to marry lydia as soon as possible and mr darcy had several meetings with wickham to arrange financisl matters with him finally mr darcy was able to visit your uncle as i have said to explain the whole business and to insist that he alone should be responsible for paying wickham the promised amount your uncle argued with him for a long time but our visitor was so obstinate that mr gardiner eventually had to agree i think lizzy that obstinacy is mr darcy s real fault rather than any of the other faults of which he has been accused he paid wickham several thousand pounds for past debts and future expenses and attended the wedding to make a final payment and in spite of mr darcy s declared motives my dear lizzy you may be sure that your uncle would never have given in if we had not assumed that mr darcy had another interest in the matter will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying how much i like him his behaviour to us has always been as agreeable as when we were in derbyshire i think that if he marries the right woman his wife may teach him to become more sociable please forgive me if i have assumed too much or at least do not punish me by not inviting me to pemberley i shall never be happy until i have been all the way round the park but i must go to my children now yours very sincerely m gardiner elizabeth read this letter with a mixture of pleasure and pain mr darcy had thought so little of his pride that he had spent considerable time effort and money on two people for whom he must feel the greatest disdain he had even had to bargain with wickham she could not believe he had done all this for her a woman who had already rejected him but the fact remained that she and her family owed him everything how bitterly she now regretted criticizing and mocking him in the past she was ashamed of herself but she was proud of him proud that in a matter of honour he had been able to conquer his own pride she was even rather pleased if a little regretful that her aunt and uncle had felt sure that there was mutual affection between mr darcy and herself mrs bennet was quite depressed when lydia and wickham left longbourn to travel north to newcastle but soon mrs philips brought the happy news that mr bingley was expected to return to netherfield in a day or two and mrs bennet became very excited she made preparations to invite him to dinner and counted the days that must pass before she could send the invitation however on only the third morning after his arrival she caught sight of him from her bedroom window riding towards longbourn house with another gentleman also on horseback girls quickly she cried mr bingley is coming and who s that with him it must be mr darcy that tall proud man well as he is mr bingley s friend we must be polite to him but i must say i hate the sight of him both jane and elizabeth felt uncomfortable and sympathized with each other jane was nervous about meeting bingley again and determined not to show her feelings elizabeth was uneasy at the thought of seeing darcy as she was the only one who knew how much the whole family owed him in spite of their general dislike of him she was astonished that he had come to see her and for a moment she allowed herself to hope that his affection and wishes might still be the same she was disappointed however by the visit mr darcy said scarcely anything to her and appeared more thoughtful and less anxious to please than in derbyshire she wondered bitterly why he had come in addition she was highly embarrassed by her mother s behaviour with flattering smiles mrs bennet concentrated all her conversation on mr bingley while throwing the occasional unpleasant remark in mr darcy s direction the only positive effect of the gentlemen s visit was the way in which jane s charm and beauty appeared to excite mr bingley s admiration all over again which elizabeth was relieved and delighted to see the bennet family did not see the two gentlemen again until tuesday when they came to dinner at longbourn it was a great pleasure to elizabeth to watch bingley sitting beside jane and talking happily to her but this was the only enjoyment she gained from the party mr darcy was unfortunately sitting a long way from her next to mrs bennet elizabeth could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how cold and formal their behaviour to each other was she would have given anything to be able to tell him that his kindness was appreciated by at least one of the family all through the long dinner she desperately hoped there would be an opportunity for her to have some real conversation with him later but the evening passed without any more than a short exchange of politeness between them and elizabeth lost all hope of immediate happiness two days after this mr bingley called at longbourn house again this time he was alone as mr darcy had gone to london he sat with the ladies for over an hour talking cheerfully and agreeably to them he came the next morning and again in the evening mrs bennet took every opportunity to leave him alone with jane by calling her other daughters out of the room for some reason or other she was hoping to encourage him to propose but in spite of her efforts bingley remained charming and agreeable and unattached but on the third day bingley came in the morning to go shooting with mr bennet he stayed for lunch and was still there in the evening and when elizabeth entered the sittingroom unexpectedly to her surprise she saw jane and bingley standing close together near the fire they turned hurriedly when they heard her and moved awkwardly away from each other bingley whispered something to jane and ran out of the room jane could not keep her secret from her sister and kissing her cried i am the happiest creature in the world oh lizzy i do not deserve this why isn t everybody as happy as i am elizabeth congratulated her sister most warmly and sincerely at last she thought the end of all mr darcy s anxious advice the end of all caroline bingley s lies and plans the happiest wisest most reasonable end i must go and tell my mother continued jane as he has just gone to ask my father s permission oh lizzy what happiness it was a joyful evening for all of them jane looked more beautiful than ever and bingley was clearly very much in love mrs bennet could not say enough to describe her delight although she talked of nothing else all evening and mr bennet was evidently very pleased before the two eldest sisters went to bed that night elizabeth listened willingly to jane s long description of bingley s good qualities at the end jane added oh lizzy if only i could see you as happy as i am if only there were another man like bingley for you dear jane i can never be as happy as you because i m not as good as you no no let me find my own husband perhaps if i m very lucky i may meet another mr collins one day the engagement was not kept a secret for very long mrs bennet whispered the news to mrs philips who told all her neighbours in meryton everybody soon agreed that the bennets were the luckiest family in the world although only a few weeks before when lydia had run away they had been considered the most unfortunate m elizabeth and darcy one morning about a week after bingley had proposed to jane a carriage arrived outside longbourn house elizabeth kitty and their mother were in the sitting room when suddenly the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh they were all extremely astonished mrs bennet flattered to have such an important visitor received her with great politeness after sitting for a moment in silence lady catherine said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother and that i suppose is one of your sisters elizabeth replied that she was correct in thinking so lady catherine rose and said i would like to have a walk in your garden miss bennet if you would accompany me go my dear cried mrs bennet show her ladyship the different walks i m sure she will like them as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the different rooms looked in and declared them to be reasonable looking rooms they went into the garden in silence elizabeth was determined to make no effort at conversation with a woman who was being more than usually rude and disagreeable lady catherine began speaking when she was sure they were alone you must know miss bennet why i have come elizabeth looked surprised indeed you are mistaken madam i have no idea why you are honouring us with a visit miss bennet replied her ladyship angrily however insincere you may be you shall not find me so a most alarming report reached me two days ago i was told that you miss elizabeth bennet would soon be engaged to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy although i knew it must be a shameful lie and i would not offend him by supposing it to be possible i decided at once to come here to let you know my feelings if you believed it to be impossible said elizabeth with disdain i wonder why your ladyship took the trouble of coming so far i came to insist on having this report contradicted tell me is it true your ladyship may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer this is too much miss bennet i insist on an answer has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be impossible but your skilful charms may have made him forget in a moment of foolishness what he owes to himself and his family you must tell me i am almost his nearest relation and i have a right to know his plans but you have no right to know mine let me speak plainly this marriage which you dare to hope for can never take place because mr darcy is engaged to my daughter his mother and i planned their marriage when they were still children they are an ideal couple both from respectable honourable ancient families with an excellent fortune on both sides what can possibly divide them the desperate ambitions of a young woman without family connections or fortune it cannot be and i warn you miss bennet if you marry him do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes but the wife of mr darcy must necessarily be so happy that she could not regret her marriage obstinate girl tell me are you engaged to him elizabeth could not avoid saying after a moment s thought i am not lady catherine seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no such promise you have totally misunderstood my character if you think i can be persuaded by such threats i do not know whether your nephew would approve of your interference in his life but you certainly have no right to interfere in mine to all the objections i have mentioned i add one more i am aware of your younger sister s elopement is such a girl to be my nephew s sister in law and bring shame on the ancient name of darcy you can now have nothing more to say elizabeth said coldly you have insulted me in every possible way she rose and started walking back to the house lady catherine also rose and walked with her unfeeling selfish girl so you are determined to have him i have not said that i am only determined to do what in my opinion will bring me happiness without reference to you do not imagine miss bennet that you will ever achieve your ambition when they arrived at her carriage she added i send no compliments to your mother you do not deserve such politeness i am most seriously displeased elizabeth did not answer and entered the house while lady catherine drove away in her carriage she had to tell a little lie to her mother to explain lady catherine s unexpected visit and speedy departure and then she shut herself in her room to consider what it all meant perhaps the collinses had imagined after the news of jane s engagement to bingley that darcy might marry her they must have told lady catherine who had made a special journey to longbourn in order to break off this supposed engagement elizabeth began to feel depressed if as seemed likely lady catherine now went straight to london to talk to her nephew she might easily convince him of the inferiority of elizabeth s social position he would probably feel that his aunt s objections which to elizabeth appeared laughably weak contained much common sense in that case he might make up his mind not to marry her under any circumstances and to keep away from longbourn altogether the next morning mr bennet called elizabeth into the library in his hand he had a letter which he had just received lizzy i did not know i had two daughters about to be married i congratulate you on a very important conquest elizabeth blushed thinking that darcy himself had written you seem to know what i mean but i think even you will not be able to guess your admirer s name this letter is from mr collins and he first congratulates me on jane s engagement of which the gossiping lucases have told him apparently the lucases also think that my daughter elizabeth might soon be marrying one of the great gentlemen in the countrymr darcy in fact now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he have chosen anyone we know as a more unlikely husband for you mr darcy who never praises only criticizes women and who probably never looked at you in his life what an admirable choice elizabeth tried to share her father s amusement but had never appreciated his humour so little he goes on to say that when he dutifully gave this news to her ladyship she made many objections and stated that she would never agree to the marriage he kindly gives us this information he says to prevent his cousin elizabeth and her admirer from rushing into a marriage not approved by their families well lizzy what do you think of that i do enjoy mr collins letters and i am delighted the lucases thought of mr darcy his perfect indifference to you and your strong dislike of him make it so extremely amusing don t you agree elizabeth had great difficulty in pretending to be amused by the letter it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly hurt her by speaking of darcy s indifference and she began to wonder whether perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have imagined too much in spite of elizabeth s doubts however mr darcy returned to netherfield a few days later and he and mr bingley came to longbourn soon afterwards bingley suggested they should all go for a walk and while he and jane concentrated on their own private conversation some distance away elizabeth found herself alone with mr darcy taking a deep breath she said bravely mr darcy i can no longer stop myself from thanking you for your extraordinary kindness to my poor sister if the rest of my family knew of it they would add their grateful thanks to mine i had hoped to keep it a secret he answered but if you must thank me let it be for yourself alone i shall not attempt to deny that wishing to give happiness to you was one of my reasons for helping your sister but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too embarrassed to say a word after a short pause he added you are too generous to play with my feelings if you still feel as you did last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will prevent me from ever mentioning them again elizabeth forced herself to speak and immediately though hesitatingly gave him to understand that her feelings had changed so considerably since that time that she was now grateful and pleased to accept his proposal when darcy heard this he was probably happier than he had ever been before and he expressed himself as warmly and sensibly as a man violently in love can they walked on without noticing in which direction there was so much to be thought and felt and said she soon learnt that his aunt had indeed seen him in london after her disappointing visit to longbourn but unluckily for her ladyship her critical comments and description of her conversation with elizabeth produced exactly the opposite result to what she had intended it taught me to hope darcy explained as i had hardly ever allowed myself to hope before i knew that if you had decided never to marry me you would have admitted it to lady catherine openly and honestly elizabeth blushed and laughed as she replied yes you have experienced my honesty after scolding you so rudely to your face i was obviously quite capable of criticizing you to all your relations i certainly deserved all your accusations as an only son i was brought up to be selfish and proud and to consider myself superior to others i would have continued like that if you dearest loveliest elizabeth had not taught me a lesson i owe you a great deal for that and i how soon i thought better of you when i read the letter you sent me when i realized your description of events must be true all my prejudices against you were removed they talked of their unexpected meeting at pemberley which had renewed their interest in each other of georgiana darcy s immediate liking for elizabeth and of the engagement between jane and bingley i guessed smiled elizabeth that you had given your permission for their marriage my permission no but i must admit i confessed to bingley that i had made a mistake in supposing that your sister was indifferent to him and i encouraged him to return to netherfield to see if she still cared for him i am delighted to hear of their engagement he will be one of the happiest men in the world when he marries your sister only i shall be happier than him when i am fortunate enough to marry you their conversation continued in this way until they suddenly became aware of the lateness of the hour they returned to longbourn house where they separated that evening elizabeth could not help telling jane her news however she almost regretted doing so when she saw the astonishment on jane s face at first jane could not believe that her sister was engaged to a man she had so disliked and she wondered if elizabeth could really be happy with him but when she had been convinced by elizabeth s explanations and promises she was delighted and congratulated her sister with all her heart the next day mr darcy came to ask mr bennet officially for elizabeth s hand in marriage mr bennet also had to be persuaded that his favourite daughter could really be happy with such a proud disdainful man only mrs bennet did not need to be convinced although she was most unusually speechless with shock when she heard the news when she recovered a little she cried my sweetest lizzy how rich you will be what jewels what carriages you will have mr darcy such a charming man so handsome so tall i am so sorry i disliked him before ten thousand a year oh my dear lizzy during the weeks of her engagement elizabeth was glad to see that all her family were beginning to appreciate mr darcy s good qualities determined to protect him from her mother s over familiarity she was relieved to see that mrs bennet respected her future son in law too much to say more than a few words to him in spite of this elizabeth looked happily forward to the time when she and darcy would leave longbourn and move to all the comfort and elegance of their own home at pemberley mrs bennet was a happy mother indeed on the day when she got rid of her two most deserving daughters it may be guessed with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy mr bennet missed his second daughter very much and greatly enjoyed going to pemberley to visit her mr bingley and jane stayed only a year at netherfield before buying a large house in the north only fifty kilometres from pemberley in this way the two sisters were permitted their dearest wish and were able to visit each other frequently mary was the only sister who remained at home as kitty spent most of her time with her two elder sisters which greatly improved her behaviour character and intelligence lydia and wickham were always moving from one place to another in search of cheap rooms and always spending more than they should his affection for her soon became indifference while hers for him lasted a little longer they were not too proud to ask lydia s sisters for financial help during every crisis and elizabeth and jane both sent them regular gifts of money to pay their bills caroline bingley was deeply offended by darcy s marriage but she did not show her bitterness and was always extremely polite to elizabeth georgiana darcy on the other hand became greatly attached to elizabeth and had the highest opinion of her lady catherine however was so rude about elizabeth to her nephew that he broke off communication completely with her for a time in the end elizabeth persuaded him to forgive his aunt who eventually fongot her pride enough to visit them at pemberley there remained a close relationship between the darcys and the gardiners darcy and elizabeth were both warmly grateful to the two people who by inviting her to derbyshire and taking her to visit pemberley had brought them together
